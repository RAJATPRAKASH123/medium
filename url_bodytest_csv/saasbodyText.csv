A few days ago I wrote that there’s more than one path to $100 million. I argued that while it’s awesome to see that some companies are able to get from 0 to $100 million in ARR in 7–8 years or even less, trying to grow that fast may not be the best choice for most companies.
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
That raises the question: What are your chances of growing a little slower and still achieving massive success? Considering that most investors are pretty obsessed focused on finding companies that follow the legendary T2D3 growth path (directionally confirmed by the responses to our SaaS napkin survey earlier this year), you might expect that your chances are low.
To answer the question, I took a look at the historic revenue development of 70 of the largest SaaS companies. A couple of notes (and some caveats) on the data sources and methodology that I’ve used:
Here are my findings:
1.) I estimate that there are over 100 SaaS unicornsThe list contains almost all public SaaS companies and some of the largest privately held ones that I could find public data for. In total, the list contains 70 SaaS companies. All of them are at $100+ million in ARR, and with the exception of one company (Domo), all of them are worth more than $1 billion. I can think of at least 10–20 other SaaS companies that should be added to the list (Talkdesk, Pipedrive, Intercom, OneLogin, AirTable, InVision, Procore, Canva, Asana,…), and I’m pretty sure there are at least 20 further ones that I’m not aware of. That makes it a pretty safe assumption that there are now 100 SaaS unicorns.
2.) The average time-to-$100-million is 10 yearsThere you have it! :-) Even if you look at a selection of the best of the best SaaS companies, getting to $100 million in 7–8 years is not the norm.
3.) Growth has accelerated in the last decadeIf you only look at companies that were started in the last 15 years, the average time-to-$100-million drops to an impressive 8 years. That’s not too far away from the T2D3 path and it shows that it is indeed possible to grow that fast; however, there are also several companies in this cohort that took 10 or more years.
4) Growth rates significantly drop as companies pass through $100 millionIn the bottom right corner of the sheet, you can see the average y/y growth rates for the year in which the companies hit $100 million and for the following year. As you can see, the average annual growth rate drops from around 75% going in to $100 million to around 50% coming out of $100 million. This is not surprising — as Rory O’Driscoll of Scale Venture Partners explained in this post, growth rates almost always decrease with increasing absolute numbers.

What is Product — Market Fit?
Product-market fit is a phrase used to describe the point at which there is *broad* market acceptance for a new application. In recent years many startups have embraced the lean startup methodology as espoused by the likes of Eric Ries and Steve Blank . They argue that startups need to behave differently compared to how real companies do. Startups need to validate the assumptions they are making, and to do so they need to build a minimal viable product and to ‘get out of the building’ to meet prospects and to learn whether or not there is a demand for your fledgling application.
In the initial phases it is likely that the feedback obtained will indicate changes needed; from minor iterations to full pivots, if the early product does not adequately meet the needs of the target market. Based on this feedback the product can be tweaked (or overhauled) to better meet the needs of the initial market segment being targeted.
Once you have a sufficient volume of real users i.e. those who have purchased the application and use it regularly, then entrepreneurs can have more confidence that there is a market demand for what they’ve built. In other words, they are solving a real problem for a particular audience. This inflection point is essentially when you have demonstrable evidence of objective third party traction and not family/friends related soft sales (see my earlier post on The Importance of Traction ).
“The number one problem I’ve seen for startups, is they don’t actually have product/market fit when they think they do.” Alex Schultz
Before we look at why this concept is important it is worth addressing an ‘elephant in the room’. In recent years a number of commentators like April Dunford have argued convincingly that the concept is inherently flawed, ill defined and a VC construct designed to *help manage expectations around valuation*.
I have some sympathy for this view, however I do think that directionally there are some valuable lessons to be had in analysising the phase before mass adoption. Hence this article focuses on the stage which is before startups have obtained a critical mass and are thus trying to validate the assumptions they make about the market opportunity. I will persist in calling this a search for product-market fit while acknowledging that it is indeed an opaque concept.
So for the purpose of this article we will assume product-market fit aligns with a point when a startup is generating a *decent volume* of inbound leads, are converting a signficant portion of these and are retaining a signficant percentage of these.
Why is Product-Market Fit Important?
Product-market fit is important because until that point you don’t know whether or not what you are building solves a real problem that a large enough market has. Without clarity on this, you could continue investing in building something that is not commercially viable. Worse still you could burn cash by hiring prematurely or investing in sales and marketing that will not generate a return (premature scaling is often cited as one of the main reasons startups fail).
“80% of SaaS companies never make product market fit.” Peter Reinhardt
For B2B SaaS startups there are a number of elements that contrive to muddy the waters here.
Firstly, if the application is particularly innovative the market may need to be educated as to the benefits which takes time and costs money.
Secondly, if you’ve taken VC investment, they’ll be keen to accelerate sales putting pressure on founders to skip this ‘research’ phase.
Finally, if sales cycles are long (and you are choosing to also prioritise sales) the feedback loop can be weak so you are not learning about demand and usage.
In these scenarios, it is usually best to offer free access to the earliest prospects in return for case studies and feedback. Case studies serve as useful social proof (independent validation) and are vitally important as you look to scale.
“Startups need 2–3 times longer to validate their market than most founders expect. This underestimation creates the pressure to scale prematurely.” (Startup Genome Study)
How do You Measure Product-Market Fit?
A good starting point is to look at user numbers discounting any initial sales closed via your own networks.
How many people have signed up, paid and continue to use it (gaining value from it) that did not have a personal connection with you? Naturally, you want this number to be pretty significant in both real terms and revenue terms.
“Glimmers of false hope is not the same as customers wanting to rip it out of your hands. Product Market fit feels like a landmine going off.” Peter Reinhardt
Once lead velocity starts growing significantly and conversion and usage rates follow suit then this can be used as a strong proxy that it has been reached. Retention also plays a part — as it underpins the unit economics of viable SaaS businesses. There is an expectation that sales and marketing expenses are up front, and revenue is spread out over a number of years into the future. This puts pressure on cash flow, however, it also means the unit economics are bad if the assumption of cash flows being generated well into the future is flawed (i.e. where churn rates are high).
Can You Put a Number on it?
Not really. And this is a core point of April Dunford’s arguments. If it is so ill defined, and hard to measure can we really say it exists? As I mentioned before for me the value is in recognising that SaaS businesses have different phases and that strategies differ greatly depending on the phase you are at. Hence we are still focused on those early unsure days when you are trying to use evidence to indicate where you are on your journey.
Given SaaS companies range from flea hunters (targeting millions of small customers at a $10 price point) to elephant hunters (enterprise customers paying $100K per year) the target number/revenue will vary depending on where your company sits on the spectrum. (See Christoph Janz: 5 Ways to Build a $100M Business for more on this idea). This alone makes it difficult to pin numbers on it.
There is also a real divergence of opinions as to what feels like a good representative data point. Leading UK VC, Jos White of Notion Capital argues that;
“ As a general rule of thumb, I believe the number (customers) has to be in double figures”.
David Cummings reaches a similar number arguing in his post 5 Ways to Identify Product-Market Fit, that 10+ customers must have signed on in a modest period of time (and they are not friendlies).
US VC Brad Feld takes a more aggressive view arguing that -
Given the divergence of views, it is thus not easy to reach an agreed figure, although the evidence is pretty overwhelming that most founders scale prematurely indicating they believe they have reached product-market fit when they have not.
The fact these commentators are mostly VC’s also align with April Dunford’s view that it is primarily a VC construct to help them place startups into different cohorts.
How Can You Tell When You Have Achieved It?
In the absence of hard numbers there are a number of proxies that can be used including:
1/ You note a significant increase in inbound inquiries
2/ Word of mouth starts to drive referrals
3/ Users are signing up, paying and deriving value from the application (as evidenced by usage and adoption)
4/ Usage becomes habitual and churn is low
5/ Any Net Promoter Score surveys you run result in an average score of 8–10
“In short, customers are knocking down your door to get the product; the main goal is to actually answer the phone and respond to all the emails from people who want to buy. You can always feel when product/market fit isn’t happening. The customers aren’t quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn’t spreading, usage isn’t growing that fast, press reviews are kind of “blah”, the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close.” Marc Andreessen
Sean Ellis (CEO of GrowthHackers) advocates that the best way to measure it is to survey your users asking
‘How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?
He argues that if you find over 40% of your users say they would be “very disappointed” if your product was no longer available then there is great chance that ‘you can build scalable, customer acquisition growth.’
Regardless of how you assess it, it is important that senior decision makers are aware of the concept and that there needs to be agreement as to when there is a consensus that the signs are sufficiently strong to shift gears.
“One of the most difficult decisions for a startup is determining when your product is good enough to drive sustainable, scalable customer growth. Trying to scale too early can easily kill your startup.” Sean Ellis
What Do You Do When You’ve Reached It?
Once you’ve reached product-market fit the theory goes that you can look to invest more aggressively in both sales and marketing. In the words of Gary Vaynerchuk, “you go all in”.
You should also have sufficient evidence at this stage to raise more capital if that is appropriate for your growth ambitions. If you’ve got a scalable business where the addressable market is large and you’ve achieved product-market fit you’ll be very much in demand!
A Word of Caution
Unfortunately reaching product-market fit is not a sign to pop open the champagne bottles. While it represents a milestone for all startups it does not follow that you are on the road to unicorn status. Bigger issues now come into play:
While it does mean you are on the right track it is no time for complacency. It does however mean your strategic options and priorities come sharply into focus.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Sales and Marketing
So how does sales and marketing fit with the above? Both sales and marketing have important roles to play depending on the stage you are at. If pre product market fit ‘sales efforts’ should be lead by the founders, after all, these early stages are more about assumption validation than sales. Once you are comfortable that product-market fit has been reached it is time to dial up sales efforts (and depending on your price point/target clients) this may involve your first senior sales hire.
From the marketing side, it is important that from Day 1 the application is marketed effectively. In the initial stages, marketing can support web development, market research, content marketing and storytelling. Paid acquisition should not form a part of the marketing strategy at the very early stages save to help test assumptions. Once product- market fit has been reached then marketing can ramp up focusing on acquisition, conversion and retention.
In short, you are looking to keep cash burn low pre product market fit investing in product and research, whereas once it is achieved you should focus on sales and marketing as you look to scale as well as exploring growth capital options to accelerate growth.
Summary
In summary, product- market fit has emerged as a key strategic milestone in most SaaS startups life. How you run your business will vary considerably depending on which side of the product market fit fence you are sitting on. Understanding the concept and recognising when you’ve achieved it is of vital importance, given the inherent dangers in scaling prematurely.
It is also important to note that there are legitimate questions as to the validity of the very existence of the concept. At the very least this article will hopefully have outlines how it is defined and perceived while also highlighting that there is valid criticsm of it as valuable approach to helping you decide on what strategy to pursue. At its most simplistic it argues that pre product market fit activities need to align around validating assumptions (like academic research) whereas post product market fit activities are aligned around acquisition and scaling. Scaling prematurely the argument goes is a sure fire way to burn through cash and escalating your demise.

https://blog.inkdrop.app/how-ive-attracted-the-first-500-paid-users-for-my-saas-that-costs-5-mo-7a5b94b8e820?source=search_post---------0,"Hello, it’s Takuya here. This is a story about my experience on my solo product called Inkdrop — a Markdown note-taking app with built-in cloud sync. It is a SaaS that earns $3,200 per month from 600 customers now, with pricing $4.99/mo or $49.9/yr. Thanks to its profit, I have had no freelance works this year. Cool. I really appreciate all your support!
Okay, I promised to share my experience how I accomplished that. I hope it’s helpful for fostering your products. If you are interested in how I successfully launched it, please read this article:
blog.inkdrop.info
Inkdrop was officially released two years ago with initial users gathered while it’s in beta. Since it’s a niche product and there are already a lot of similar apps like Evernote out there, Inkdrop has not ever got covered on any major news media or blogs so far. I have even not ever used any ads. Instead, I solely focused on making existing users happier and I wrote some blogposts about my ‘successful’ strategies on my product and my freelance career. Those gradually made growth through word of mouth.
So I made engagements almost from myself. The growth was always calm and stable — It’s better than making a buzz from large media because traffic they will generate would be a big spike making your servers too busy and a lot of inquiries you can’t handle at once, resulting in providing poor user support.
Don’t hurry. It’s not a startup rushing to an exit.
Customers are likely to continue using it through months unless they found any significant problem once they decided to subscribe the app. The recent churn rate is 2–3%, which is surprisingly low. The reason I guess is that developers are very particular about tools. They have been eagerly testing other apps out over the years and finally chose my app. That’s why they don’t switch to other app easily, like he says:
Your application is a life changer. I’ve tried numerous markdown based applications over the years and I’m so pleased to finally find a keeper! Awesome work! — James Lilliott
But they are always looking for better tools. Like me, they even try to create it by themselves. To keep the churn rate low, the app has to be kept fresh and stable.
As I wrote in this article, it’s important to focus on providing good user support in the early stage. And its importance doesn’t change in the growth phase. I quit using GitHub for support and deployed an official forum using Discourse, an open source discussion platform with many plugins and REST API support. I integrated Inkdrop with it with Single Sign-On(SSO) so that I can see who on the service posts. And now, there are 264 topics and 1,367 posts created so far. 620 posts of those are mine.
Spending a lot of time at the forum is not a waste of time. As the number of posts increased, the forum works as FAQs and a history of my thoughts. Users google first when they got a suggestion, problem or question, then they find existing topics on the forum — just like Stackoverflow. So they can get an answer quickly and you can also avoid answering the same inquiry many times. And it results in that I can concentrate on other things.
Since it’s a personal project, users tend to worry about the possibility of the service close. In fact, it is always possible even if by a big company. But you can talk about the future of the service, about what’s coming next, so that users can have their expectations for it. Over the years, I publish a roadmap like following:
I guess it’s effective to make customers’ subscriptions longer because they can wait for features they want to be added, like him:
Inkdrop has been my go-to note app for some time now and I’m super pumped to hear about the new features. — Luke Stacey, from a comment on the roadmap vol.3
And it even makes the app live longer — because such reaction motivates me, of course :)
Don’t be a secretive person. Open your thoughts about your product.
As I said I solely focused on making existing users happier for making growth, there are several ways I have taken to foster their loyalties.
I customized the forum to show a star badge only on paid users. It allows me to easily recognize whether a user is paid or not, and I could prioritize which topic to write a response first (though I have been replying to all quickly as possible).
Our forum has a restricted category where only paid users can view and post. I used it for discussing the next roadmap with customers. It’s a great way to make them feel special. Besides, they are so cooperative because they already understand its concept.
When developing the new mobile app, only paid users were allowed to test it out. They seemed to enjoy it and gave me many feedback. I was surprised that a few users finished their trial manually and purchased to try the beta version.
You are a part of your product. The more you got known by people, the more your product gets chances to be used. Blogging is a powerful way to attract people who potentially use your product. Yes, honestly, this blogpost is also part of my content marketing. Write anything about what you can ‘teach’, as Brian Clark says:
These days, people want to learn before they buy, be educated instead of pitched — Brian Clark
I think he is right — I hate being pitched. I don’t believe salesmen’s talk, promoted articles and advertisements because they only try to sell their products and informations they give are not helpful, useful, or even trustworthy. But I believe people who make me happy. So there are many people like me, as he says. How about you?
Teaching something is a good way to make people happy. It is just useful. You should have something you can teach. But it would be much better if you could write strategies than tips because there are quite few people talking about strategies. There are many people who can talk about how to solve a specific problem on JavaScript coding, etc. But, for example, a blogpost about how to price yourself as a freelance developer would be more valuable. Actually, it has got 14.8k total views.
Again, you are a part of your product. Your blogposts have to be your story, not someone’s. People read your articles, then they will be interested in you. Some my customers said they would like to support me rather than my product. Telling your story would increase your product value.
You don’t have to care about competitors. It’s a waste of time. Because you know where to go. You can ignore even if they stole features your product has. Because you are the person who most understands your product, how it works and why it works.
If you often watch competitors too much, you will be affected by them and you will be too eager not to lose to them. Remember your first motivation. It is a niche product that solves your own problem, not for beating others. Similarly, they also have their own problems to solve. You can coexist with them.
People always talk about which product is the best. But it’s just one perspective on their needs. Everyone has a different need and problem. Your target is only people who are in the same boat. Keep going your direction.
Product is like a living creature. It will never be perfect. As it grew, you will get more work to do. Release it even if you think it is not perfect yet because every release is a feasibility test. You will find something new that you didn’t expect from users.
You will get many ups and downs on your way — A new feature might have a significant bug you haven’t noticed and it would cause some customers to quit. I recently experienced that but I would think it was a necessary process to make the app more reliable. You are not perfect. So is your product. Finish your work and see how it goes. Don’t be afraid.

Product: EverhourFirst paid client: Sep 2015Team size right now: 7HQ: Minsk, BelarusInvestments: Bootstrapping
$1 million by itself isn’t a big thing. But it’s a certain bar and any founder on the way to it faces similar questions and problems. I’m not an exception and therefore would like to share key lessons I’ve learned.
We started in 2010 as a small outsourcing company — Weavora. The idea of ​​the product was born here from our internal needs. We needed to report and invoice our clients based on actual hours spent. At first, we used existing tools, but soon realized that we could offer a better idea.
In September 2015 we signed our first paid client. Today we crossed the $1.3M ARR mark (growing x2.2 times per year) and used by 2,200+ companies from 70 countries. We have accomplished all that without external investor and with a small team (7 people).
Here is how.
Your product should have a clear advantage. Something that will help you to stand out and ideally not so easy to copy for a competitor. This cannot be for example 10% lower price.
In our case it was how deeply we connect with the most popular project management tools and how nicely we embed into their interface.
And while we did not have a free plan, had much less features compared to competitors, didn’t have a mobile app etc. many users still preferred us. Why? Because we did one important feature very-very well.
Of course, we gradually react to requests from our customers, add new functionality, but at the beginning, we did not have much of it and could not do everything overnight.
I can’t believe in making a good product if you don’t use it by yourself.
In our case, doing outsourcing business, we had to report to our clients, make project assessments, issue invoices. And we relied on Everhour to see what projects we underestimated and why, what projects were more profitable, find out where we can save our time and money and how else we can simplify and automate our process and operations.
In addition, by using your product daily you will be sure that everything works. Synthetic testing can sometimes fail to detect a serious problem.
I cannot say that making a product from personal finances (or from the operating revenues of different business) is better or worse. This is possible and even has a number of benefits.
What has guided us?
As I mentioned, we started with outsourcing. This is much easier and faster to organize than a profitable product. When the company began to earn and we had the opportunity to reinvest profits — we did it. All the free time we focused on the product. We were more interested in doing this rather than looking for investors, pitching and reporting.
In addition, consider that we are not from the US, where such ecosystem is more developed.
The last factor is probably the fear of borrowing and the need to meet high expectations. If you already have some historical data, it is easier, but in the very beginning — scary.
Bootstrapping, on the other hand, forces you to launch sooner and validate your hypotheses. Spending own money would make you way more careful about costs and forces to set priorities correctly.
But I must admit that it‘s difficult to do outsourcing and product in parallel. The main problem is defocusing. We have to equally devote time to current projects, communication with existing customers and the product.
Would early investment help us?
I doubt. We did several “pivots” because misunderstood market demand. Some good ideas need time to mature (same to us). Having received the investment early on, we wouldn’t know what to do. It is unlikely that this would help us to be where we are now faster. Most likely we’d simply flush money into ads, bigger team and would not care as much about early releases. We could find ourselves in a situation when we add feature by feature until realize that we neither have a good product nor the money.
Investment is like a rocket fuel. It can help a lot, but this requires a very good product/market fit, understanding key metrics and a growth strategy.
We once decided not to have a free plan. We did this for several reasons.
Our competitive advantage is integrations. But they all have API limits. We can have a paid customer with 5 projects we should sync and a free user with 100 projects. I.e. free users can easily eat much more resources.
In our experience, free users more often contact support (due to their larger number), they react more sharply to your failures, they ask absolutely different features rather than those who are paying, etc.
And the conversion from free to paid is very low. Expect about 0.5–1%.
In the beginning, we did not want to offer annual subscriptions. Probably there was some kind of self-doubt. But then we tried and it turned out to be a very good idea.
This will significantly increase your cash flow, approximately +10–15% to your MRR. In addition, this reduces the number of monthly failures and delinquent churn.
There are customers who want to limit themselves to only one invoice a year. It’s probably some kind of savings on bookkeeping.
If users on average use your product for less than a year, the annual subscription will increase your LTV. Because money has already been paid.
Last but not least, it’s kind of “reputational” thing, showing you as a serious company.
For any product, it is very important to quickly find a stable and cheap channel of attracting leads. For us, it was partner directories. For example, Asana or Basecamp both have an integration section on their website. You can post information about your product there.
Do not hesitate to contact these companies. If your integration makes something useful to their users, you thereby make their product better and make their users stay with them longer. And for you, this is a high-quality traffic! Lead conversion from a partner directory is about 30%. So it’s a win-win scenario.
We tried Google Adwords several times, spent several thousand dollars and received 0 paid customers. Of course, it doesn’t mean that the channel is bad and we won’t use it one day. But keep in mind that this is not easy and costly. CPC for the best keywords might be up to 10–15 USD. Consider your funnel from visitor to lead and to the paid client. Plus you should constantly optimize your landings, banners, texts etc.
Another great channel for us is organic. This is great, but a long-term investment in content and SEO. We wrote an article comparing us with two other time tracking tools. People searched for articles comparing these two companies and learned about us. The first year, this article brought us up to 1,000 new visitors a month.
I’m sure there are plenty of great pieces of advice that I’ve left out. In the comments, feel free to share your thoughts or any tips. I’d love to hear them!
Cheers!

Top highlight
The article was initially published on Codica blog.
Until the late 90th, we had to install various software on our PCs: for working with documents, messaging, or task management. Every new piece of software took up space on a hard drive. An update could take several hours or even a whole day since it needed tons of resources, our skills, and hard drive space.
Gladly, these days are in the past. It has become possible due to SaaS products and cloud computing boost. The recent forecasts state that the SaaS market will reach $623 billion by 2023.
We have researched the SaaS domain future and came up with a guide on how to start a cloud solution, and discussed why starting with an MVP is crucial.
A SaaS product is a cloud application that offers its services to all users via the Internet.
Instead of downloading an app, all users access it from a web browser on a desktop or from their smartphones.
Below are the main types of SaaS products with the key market shapers.
SaaS market overview
While COVID-19 had a massive negative influence on many businesses, its influence on the SaaS domain was not so bad. Only 27% of the companies claim a negative impact, while 40% claim from little to no negative influence.
Here comes the three key SaaS facts by FinancesOnline to keep an eye on.

The future of SaaS: chaos or a solution for every need?
On the one hand, the Internet connection is getting faster and more reliable, and even more SaaS startups are expected to reach the market. The majority of the businesses say that after 2022 they will use SaaS to cover over 80% of their software needs. So, this market is growing really fast.
On the other hand, there are so many similar SaaS tools on the market now. Such a diversity confuses users and even causes a kind of SaaS chaos. It’s getting pretty hard to choose a cloud solution.
So, what’s next? There are many options here. For example, big SaaS names start to collaborate to help their end-users. For instance, Figma claimed the integrations with GitLab recently. Of course, these collaborations don’t solve the problem of chaos in full but prove brands’ awareness and desire to support the users.
Bottom line: We are witnessing a real boost in the SaaS market now and it’s not going to slow down.
What is a SaaS MVP about? It’s an early product version, ready to be put on the market. It has must-have features only and brings real value for its end-users.
Benefits of MVP for a SaaS startup
Even if you totally love your product idea, don’t hurry. SaaS startups tend to fail. Statistics state that over 90% of SaaS startups stop working during the first 5 years. So do some research, check the market, and probe your idea with the minimal valuable product first.
To help you in your MVP journey, we have collected the main advantages of MVP for SaaS startups.
Tech stack for a cloud MVP
Try to make your solution scalable for developers, and secure, and performing for both with no bells and whistles. Some useful tips to follow:
When we talk about MVP development, we usually follow the best practices. SaaS solutions are not an exception.
Competitive research. Know your market, your competitors, and where you can provide more value to users.
Customer’s pains and needs. Listen to your end-users challenges, and they will help you out to create a product they need.
Features set
Choose only the required functionality for your MVP. Have a look at these popular principles to avoid unnecessary work:
Choosing the Pricing Model
The pricing model in SaaS is a method to set the desired price for a solution. Among the top popular SaaS models are per-user pricing, tiered pricing, per-storage pricing, and pay as you go. All come with their Pros and Cons. We have created a top 8 SaaS Pricing Models: Ultimate Guide 2021 to assist you in picking the needed model.
Prototyping and MVP Development
Probe your idea with a working ‘draft’, a prototype. Once done, move to creating the ready-to-the-market MVP version.
Feedback gathering. Don’t waste your time with untested ideas. Always listen to your end-users and their feedback.
There is no average cost for all SaaS solutions. The price always depends on many factors, including the project scope, tech stack, and the development team’s expertise. Let’s find out what influences the final cost in detail.
You can create an MVP using any popular framework. Our top three are Ruby on Rails (back-end), and React.js, or Vue.js (front-end). As for the Rails framework, it offers free open-source libraries, gems. There are over 167,000 gems now for different ready solutions. Using these solutions, you can speed up the development thus saving costs.
Consider only the must-have features for your MVP solution with no extras. More does not mean better. It will cost you extra and won’t bring value to users so will be a waste of resources and time.
When you work with SaaS experts, you will benefit from the vast expertise of the developers who have delivered many cloud solutions.
This way, you can count on both an accurate estimate, expert advice, and quality app development on time and on budget.
When we are talking about the prices or hourly rates, the calculations will depend on the location and the level of the development team. Below we have collected recent web development rates for three popular locations.
In order to estimate the final cost, you should consider all these factors. If you struggle to do it yourself or need advice, consider an experienced SaaS development team.
Codica has been delivering SaaS development services since 2015. Our team works hard to deliver the solution’s security, uniqueness, scalability, and integration with other tools.
One of the SaaS MVPs we delivered is the Accommodation search for expats. The idea was to make the relocation to Australia top smooth for people who found a job there.
The main challenges were:
We presented a complex MVP solution with a search wizard and personalized pop-ups.
With the world’s shift to remote work, the SaaS domain proved its numerous benefits for businesses. Even if you did not consider cloud products before, it’s high time to move in this direction. On the bright side, you can use some ready solutions, and start off with a product MVP.
Looking for a trusted SaaS development company? Consider the Codica team. If you start a new cloud-based app or need to manage an existing one, Codica team is here to share expertise in cloud solutions. We will help you solve all development pains, and assist your business to stand out from competitors.

SaaS apps are quite complicated.
When a new user decides to try your app by signing up for the free trial, they’re only one step closer to conversion.
But, if they don’t have a good first impression from your app, they’ll leave and never return.
This is what makes the onboarding process crucial.
breadnbeyond.medium.com
You need to create not only a great but perfect onboarding experience so that they stick around and become a loyal user.
And when we talk about SaaS onboarding, we shouldn’t ignore the power of videos.
This engaging format is perfect for drawing attention and keeping that drawn attention for a brief period.
SaaS onboarding can be daunting for both new users and SaaS marketers like you.
New users have the urgency to leverage most of the features on your app, and you have to help them to get started and stay engaged.
In this situation, videos provide the most convenient way to deliver even complex topics into more snackable and digestible chunks.
It lets users take the wheel and learn the product at their own pace since they can pause, rewind, or stop the video easily.
This way, it would be much easier for even a beginner to understand how each feature can help them reach their goals.
Videos also combine visual and audio elements to make it easier for new users to learn more about your app stress-free.
Meanwhile, you also should have no problem delivering techie messages to them without ever overwhelming them.
Of course, you know your app like the back of your hand, but when it comes to onboarding, you have to put yourself in new users’ shoes.
There are top three types of video that most SaaS apps use for their onboarding strategy:
Those types of videos are short and straightforward, making the information quick and easy to retain for new users.
That’s why they produce more engagement and a next-level value.
Onboarding videos can act like a virtual guided tour designed to give new users more information about your app in the most convenient way.
That being said, poorly-created onboarding videos, in fact, can be more hindering to your onboarding process than helping.
You need to make sure every part of the onboarding video flow is easy to understand and adequate.
Here’s how you can ensure that your onboarding videos are on-point:
Every new user has their own goals, pain points, and use cases while using your app.
So, it’s safe to say that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for onboarding videos.
That’s why you need to personalize it, helping each of your new users find their solutions to their specific needs.
Try to ask new users for some info in the very beginning — right after they sign up to your app so that you can craft an engaging, well-tailored onboarding video that addresses their needs.
A successful onboarding video should help users leverage your app’s features hassle-free. And people tend to remember uncompleted tasks rather than completed ones.
In this case, you need to make your onboarding videos short, quick, but detailed.
Putting all information of all your features in one single onboarding video can only overwhelm new users.
So, if you have some specific features that need a little bit more complicated explanation, you can break them into smaller pieces by creating multiple short videos.
Read more: Keep Your Videos Short and Focused
Even though onboarding videos can be a powerful tool to educate new users to understand more about your app and its features, some of the users might still need further details.
And since it’s crucial to keep your onboarding videos short and straightforward, you can include links or other pages of your websites where they can get further information they need. It can be your landing page, FAQ page, or Features page.
Read More: Landing Page Videos
Using easy and simple language makes your onboarding videos easy to follow and retain.
Remember that you create videos to simplify the explanation of your app and its features.
Plus, not all new users are familiar with your app or features in general, so providing them explanations with easy-to-understand language can help them understand how it helps them solve their problems.
No matter how user-friendly your app might be, you need to make sure that even an average and novice user who is logging in for the first time will know exactly what to do with your videos.
Some users are completely new and need time to explore more about the features and how they can use them.
Others have already used your app, so they already know and are familiar at least with some features.
Providing a skip button allows users to pass on ones that they’re already familiar with so that they can focus on the features they want to learn more about.
Your onboarding videos will not only need to be short and straightforward, but it also needs to be easy to follow.
Rather than simply saying ‘next, I click this and go to this tab and click this.
Make sure you give a clear explanation of each of your actions in the demonstration and the reason why you do it.
It will help the user understand each feature’s benefits and remember them more effectively.
That’s been a quick guide on how to create SaaS onboarding videos for better user engagement.
Now we know that video is a perfect addition to improve your overall onboarding experience and make users stick around your app for a long period of time.
That way, you can lower your churn rate and increase your conversion rate.

Top highlight
Let me start this post with a question. If you look at the chart below, what do you see?
What you see, I assume, is the 12-month chart of a SaaS company that isn’t doing too well. Our fictional SaaS company, let’s call it Acme, Inc., hasn’t grown its customer count, and while MRR has increased, the growth rate of ~40% over a one year period isn’t particularly exciting. What you’ll also notice is that the 40% MRR growth must be entirely owed to a (remarkable) increase in the company’s ARPA.
What I bet you can’t see in this chart is that Acme is serving two different segments, let’s call them “rabbits” and “deer” ⁽¹⁾. The customer and MRR numbers shown in the chart above are the aggregates of the numbers of these two segments. Let’s look at these two segments side by side:
What becomes visible now is that the company has historically been selling mostly to rabbits, but that part of the business is on the decline. The company’s emerging deer segment has been growing very fast, though. In the last 12 months, Acme almost tripled its deer customer base, increasing deer MRR from $30,000 to $89,000⁽²⁾. If the company continues to grow its deer segment at this pace, it will soon generate the vast majority of its revenue from deer customers, and the rabbit segment will soon become an almost irrelevant legacy business.
If you look at the aggregate numbers only, the very promising development of the deer segment and the potential that it holds for the future of the entire company get almost completely masked by the underperforming rabbit segment. If you fail to segment your data you may, therefore, end up underselling yourself to investors. Even more importantly, looking at aggregate numbers or averages across your entire customer base may lead to poor business decisions, e.g. when it comes to how you allocate marketing dollars or the precious time of your AEs. As you might know, I firmly believe that in order to build a $100M ARR SaaS company, you need to know which animals you’re hunting. Without proper segmentation, you’re most likely hunting in the dark.
If you’re not convinced yet, let’s turn to some real animals and imagine a zoo director who tells you that his three rabbits and two elephants eat a total of 500 kilograms of vegetables per day. 100 kilograms per animal per day! 😉 If you need even more proof that averages can be misleading, let me just tell you that on average, Pawel and I have a normal height.
The math behind these little phenomenons is, of course, trivial. And yet, I often talk to companies that I think could do a better job of breaking down their data into segments. Why is that? There are (at least) three reasons:
To drill down on the last point a little, consider, for example, an early-stage company that has 50 highly active trial users and a much larger number of trial users who signed up but never used the product for real. There can be various reasons for the high initial drop-off, and the company should try to understand and address them. However, by looking only at the average activity of all users, which is very low in this scenario, you might not notice that there is a significant number of people who love the product, which at the company’s stage might be more important than a well-oiled conversion funnel.
Let’s turn to a chart that shows the development of Acme’s churn rate and growth rate:
As you can see, Acme’s annual growth rate (or growth factor, I should say) is hovering at around 1.4x and churn is at or a little higher than 2%.
But if we look at these numbers separately for deer and rabbits …
…. we notice that the rabbit business is deteriorating, as evidenced by a high (~3%) and steadily rising churn rate and a slowdown in growth, which wasn’t visible in the aggregate chart. The deer segment doesn’t look great on this chart either but it has a significantly lower churn rate (1–1.5%).
Here’s another one, showing Acme’s sales & marketing spend and CAC payback time:
You can see that Acme has been increasing its sales and marketing spend month after month and has managed to keep its CAC payback time in a narrow corridor of 10–12 months. At this point, you probably know what comes next, so here goes:
Breaking down the sales and marketing KPIs by segment reveals that CAC payback time has more than doubled in the rabbit segment, while it keeps decreasing for deer! If you were the CEO of Acme and you didn’t have this information, you would keep wasting money on acquiring rabbits — money that would most likely be much better spent acquiring more deer.
Let’s turn to another fictional SaaS company, BCME, Inc:
The take-away from this chart is that BCME has more than tripled its customer base over the last 12 months, but the company’s ARPA has plummeted from more than $100 to less than $70.
You guessed right, it looks different if you peel back the onion:
BCME has almost quadrupled its rabbit customer base, while the ARPA in this segment went down from $50 to $40. In its deer customer segment, on the other hand, BCME has increased its customer count from 40 to 71 while at the same time increasing ARPA from $1000 to about $1130.
If we zero in on the development of the company’s ASP (Average Selling Price, ARPA for new customers), the different trajectories of the two segments are even more pronounced. You can’t see this in the charts, but if you look at the source data you’ll see that rabbit ASP fell from $50 to $28 while deer ASP increased sharply from $1000 to over $1500. The declining rabbit ASP and the growing deer ASP could be caused by a variety of factors such as changes in pricing, marketing mix, or competitive landscape, to name just a few. What’s clear is that a significant change is taking place in each of these segments, a development that deserves attention and that would be overlooked by measuring ARPA/ASP across the entire customer base.
Before I’ll let you go I’d like to show you this chart of yet another fictional SaaS company, CCME, Inc:
It looks like in the last 12 months, CCME’s churn rate dropped from about 4% to a bit more than 2.5% per month, an impressive achievement. (If you, too, want to decrease your churn rate by almost 50%, check out Brightback.⁽³⁾)
But lo and behold, a few months later it appeared that the company’s churn rate suddenly jumped to more than 3.5% and never returned to the ~2.5% low:
What happened? In month 3, CCME introduced an annual plan which was selected by 50% of the company’s new customers. Those customers obviously couldn’t cancel in month 4 (nor in the following 11 months), so the number of cancelations went down a little bit in month 4. Because the company kept the annual plan offering (which continued to be picked by 50% of new customers), the percentage of customers who couldn’t cancel increased with each month. As a result, CCME’s churn rate appeared to decrease month after month — until month 15, when the first annual plan cohort reached the end of its contract duration.
Once again, looking at the segmented data makes things much clearer:
As you can see now, the churn rate of the monthly plan segment didn’t change. For the segment of annual plan customers, churn cannot be measured until 15 months (which makes it all the more important to monitor customer health, which avoids bad surprises later on and gives you a chance to address churn before it happens). And even then, the simple (number of cancelations in month n) / (number of customers at the beginning of month n) formula (which is used for the chart above) can be highly misleading if the number of customers in the annual plan segment is growing fast. That’s why the best way to understand churn is a cohort analysis.
PS: There’s an expression in German that says “Man kann nicht alles über einen Kamm scheren”, which means that you can’t lump everything together. The word-by-word translation of this saying would be “you can’t shave everything over one comb”. I know that doesn’t make any sense for English ears, but when it comes to segments in SaaS, you really can’t shave everything over one comb.

Be the first to respond.
It was September 12, 2018 when Gianluca and I found ourselves in a Parisian bar called l‘Abribus to reflect on some ideas we could build together.
I had just returned to Paris from the summer holidays, I had left my full-time job for about a month and, although I was convinced I wanted to start a project, I had no clear ideas about what I could work on during the following months 😰.
Before the summer, I had proposed to Gianluca an idea about a software that could help hotels boost direct bookings, reducing the ones coming from OTAs (that’s where the name Callbell 🔔 was born: despite the pivot, we decided to keep the same brand as it was still ok for the tool we would have built afterwards 💡). ️
During the month of August, Gianluca had started to built a small MVP for our initial idea and in September we were almost ready to start validating the idea.
It is at this point that, by chance, we landed on a Twilio website page that was advertising the recent release of the WhatsApp Business APIs. We quickly realized that we wanted to learn more about it.
Although we had never explored the subject, we both thought how cool it would be for many B2C businesses to be able to connect with their customers via WhatsApp so, shortly after, we forgot about our previous hotels idea (yes, that was fast 😹) and started discussing about something new that would allow companies to easily integrate this channel into their customer service.
That’s the moment where our Callbell ride begins 🛴️.
As many other online businesses everything started by building a landing page and bringing traffic to understand as quickly as possible if the idea we had in mind could have been interesting for our target market. We knew that’s a validation step you need to take before writing the very first line of code so within a week our website was ready to go live for some Facebook Ads.
Meanwhile, we soon realized that only one channel was not enough to build a truly valuable product. That’s why, in addition to WhatsApp, we included the integration with Facebook Messenger, Instagram Direct and Telegram to our initial value proposition.
By the time we started the first campaign, the idea, the website and the ads had been refined and at the 15th of September we were ready to go: we started promoting a platform that would centralize support requests from all major channels based on direct messaging applications plus a website widget to allow visitors to choose which channel they’d like to use to be supported.
I would like to tell you more about why we think there is space for building something relevant in the external communication management landscape but I will leave this topic for a later post.
This was a crucial phase for two main reasons:
We started the first campaign on September 16th and run it until October 7th. Everything on the site was designed as the tool already existed: once you signed up with your email, you’d be able to create an account on Callbell.
Here’s the stats:
Despite the relative small size of this first test and being aware that these results may probably not be that significant on a large scale, we were extremely satisfied with what had just happened. After 2 weeks, there were 15 companies out there that wanted to test our product… and that is an amazing feeling 😎
It was even more interesting to discover that those companies belonged to very different verticals: online travel sites, e-commerces, blogs, food delivery start-ups and even a traditional bank 🙄
Well, easy … we tried to talk to all the companies that had signed up, trying to understand what was the real reason for which they had done it (excluding at least it was mere curiosity 😅).
The answers we got are in line with what we already expected: in the B2C space, the ability to reach customers wherever they are and on applications that already use, especially on WhatsApp and Messenger (as well as instantly gather user information after the conversation has started) is seen as a critical advantage over traditional customer support solutions (both ticket management and live chat).
Nowadays you hear a lot about “talking to your potential customers”, “finding product marketing fit” etc etc … but once you find yourself in this phase you soon realize that, despite all the nice Youtube talks, it is not so easy to get relevant information (in addition to confirming that they like the idea and the’d like to test it) without having a real product.
That’s why we started to build our MVP 🔥
While Gianluca was beginning to lay the groundwork for software development, I was “designing” (using UXPin, which I absolutely recommend) what could remotely resemble a clickable mock-up 🤐.
(We promise that, to date, things have improved a lot 🎨.
After starting to build, we started thinking about what we would have liked to achieve from there to the end of the year. Three months may seem like a few when you work as an employee in a traditional company; but when you start from 0 and you’re all-in on your own project, the long-term concept takes on a totally different meaning 😵
Sunday, October 14th, at the Starbucks you find in front of the Bonne Nouvelle metro station on the Grands Boulevard, we set-up a Trello board and gave each other realistic goals on each aspect of the project, dividing the tasks into the following categories:
Every aspect we would work on from there would be aimed at achieving our goal: to get the first paying customer within 6 months (so by mid-April 2019, let’s see if we can do it 💪) from the start of the project.
From that day on and in the following two months, we started focusing on:
1) Building a MVP that could include only what we considered essential, leaving it as simple as possible. The great part of the features we wanted to include in the MVP have been developed and we expect to launch the product by mid-March. To date, the product looks like something like this 🌼 :
2) Set up a geo-localized marketing strategy: for the type of company we’d like to build, we tought it was crucial for us to be acting “glocal” from day 1: we have built and indexed a website and started a blog in 4 languages (EN, FR, ES and IT) to reach as many people as possible on our target search keywords: despite the huge amount of energy it takes at the beginning, we are convinced that this effort on SEO will pay off in the long run 🌍
3) Continue the conversation with the first potential customers, partners and investors (yes, we considered the possibility of raising a pre-seed of around $150K to help finance the launch phase, but we decided to leave it for a post-revenue stage 💰)
4) Keep generating new leads (coming from both paid and non-paid channels: a mix between FB ads, content and outbound - repeating the same test we did on the Italian market in other countries) that would commit to test our product from day 1: to date, more than 45 companies signed up on our site and we are ready with 15 of them to start with a beta test 🏁
5) Designed an affiliate program that will help our product to go viral. This is why every Callbell user (even on a free plan) will automatically become one of our affiliates when installing our widget on his website. This is a way to allow everyone to start monetizing their website traffic when bringing us new users, thanks to the classic “powered by” link under the chat widget ⚡
I would like to share more on each of the 5 categories, but the post would become too long so I will try to publish one next with more details about each point 📌. Moreover, we do not know if this is necessarily the right strategy to follow (each project is quite unique and need to follow different paths) but what is important is to know that we put all our energy to understand if it was worthwhile to be working on this project from here to al least the next 2 years.
These first months have been intense and we are aware that there is still a lot to go and new challenges to face. What I can easily say is that, despite what may happen in the future, I feel like this experience has taught us so much in a very short space of time! And this is a fantastic feeling! 😍
As we would like transparency to be one of our core values, from now on we will try to update you on all the evolutions of the project, hoping that this can be useful to those who want to embark on a similar path.
That’s all for now! Thank you for joining us up here and talk soon!

I’m a huge fan of Meteor. It socketizes everything, transpiles your styles, and gives you a big chunk of code to push to a server. Sometimes though, you need something more flexible.
Like any standard Saas, I needed a small landing page I could serve from a CDN, a portal that offered a realtime websocket experience, and an easy path to scale both vertically and horizontally.
The end result is something I call Meatier, which I open sourced on github: http://github.com/mattkrick/meatier. The package solves a lot of problems (JWT authentication & authorization, scaling sockets, using redux as a client-side cache, storing socket state in redux, optimistic & realtime database updates, etc.) but for this entry, I decided to focus on webpack. Why? Because there are 100 “webpack 101” guides, and not a single “webpack 201”.
For this project, I used webpack 2 (beta). It still has a bug or 2, but you won’t find them easily.
I’ll assume you already have a development config built. If you don’t already know how to build a config for development, well…
The first step is to go through your router & make all your synchronous components async. Let’s go through an example with react-router@1.0.2:
The first thing to notice is the route isn’t in JSX and it’s actually a function taking in your redux store. This makes things easier for code-splitting your redux reducer (more on that in the next blog… if you like this one). The magic happens in the System.import. In the spec, this returns a promise to deliver the module. In webpack 2, it’s statically assessed and ready to become its own separate chunk that can be dynamically required.
Great. Now webpack knows how to split your code in the best way possible so that you never send an extra byte down the wire. But… sometimes that’s not the best. For example, maybe saving an extra 5Kb isn’t worth the extra HTTP request. That’s why there’s AggressiveMergingPlugin. It balances your request to size ratio. There’s also MinChunkSizePlugin, which I keep set at 50000 to limit my tiny chunks.
The next step is to make the second visit better for the user (they will visit your site a second time, right?) To do so, we want to load as much code as possible from their browser cache. Fewer bytes sent = more money for you and a faster load for them. To do this, we’ll break out the vendor packages, because chances are you won’t update React as much as you’ll update your own bug-infested code. (example below, hang tight)
The next step is to address updates. When a client loads an asset, the browser looks at the filename. If it can resolve the filename locally, it won’t send a request. That means if your file is named something like app.js, you could push an update and the client will never download it until the cache is invalidated. To solve this, assign a chunkhash that changes when the contents of the file changes.
Now, instead of requesting app.js statically in our HTML, we’ll need to request a name that changes on every build. To do this, we use the AssetsPlugin to create a lookup table between the asset and chunkhashed name:
Then, we just require assets.json before we make our HTML, and stick in the assets.app.js. Easy! https://github.com/mattkrick/meatier/blob/master/src/server/Html.js
There’s a problem though: if a chunk changes, that’ll change the hash for your other chunks as well, causing all your chunks to require a fresh download. To avoid this, there’s the NamedModulesPlugin that replaces webpack’s module numbers with the actual pathnames. Just call it with no options and on the next build all the chunks will have distinct hashes. Note: for the security minded, you may not want to share your pathnames with the client, which is why there’s HashedModuleIdsPlugin. It’ll cause a little extra bloat, but offers some peace of mind.
At this point, the only chunks that are updated are the ones where you changed code & the one with the webpack runtime in it. Unfortunately, that webpack runtime is bundled into the last common chunk, probably the vendor.js. To get around this, we’ll need to extract out the webpack runtime so instead of refreshing 2 files, it’ll refresh just the one you want:
Since the last common chunk always has the runtime, we’ll extract it out in our CommonsChunkPlugin. Note that it doesn’t have a corresponding entry chunk and since minChunks is Infinity, nothing else can be added to it.
To get the manifest in our HTML, we could make another HTTP request, but requesting a couple bytes of data seems like a waste, so let’s just inline it. To do so, we’ll grab the name from the assets.json, then read out the contents into a string:
https://github.com/mattkrick/meatier/blob/master/src/server/createSSR.js
The last step is the worst. CSS. You have 4 choices:
I personally like external stylesheets. At the expense of another HTTP request, I get something that loads very quickly, doesn’t need JavaScript, and can be cached on the client. While in a perfect world we’d have 1 stylesheet per chunk, this isn’t possible yet for server side rendering (if I’m wrong, let me know!). Given that CSS repeats a lot of the same strings, it’ll compress very small, so let’s opt for 1 big style sheet.
Currently, there are a lot of hacky solutions to solve the problem that node doesn’t know how to require a css file. Maybe you’ve seen some:
I don’t like any of them. Rewriting your components just to achieve SSR seems wrong. So, I decided to make a webpack build of my router on the server. Since webpack knows what to do with the css files, it can build the entire router & then use that to render a page on the server side. Webpack makes this easy if you know what to do: just set your target to ‘node’ and your output.libraryTarget: “commonjs2”. https://github.com/mattkrick/meatier/blob/master/webpack/webpack.config.server.js
Next, use the ExtractTextPlugin to create your css file. With both webpack 1 & 2, I got some unexpected behavior where setting the plugin’s allChunks to true would create multiple CSS files, but also put all the contents in the main css file. To solve this, I limit the chunks to 1 with LimitChunkCountPlugin. The end result is 1 prerendered router that your server can use to render some HTML, and a CSS file that has all the styles that your site will use.
For faster server startup times (assuming you’re using babel on the server), you can exclude this prerendered bundle with the following options:
Now you know how to write a production ready webpack config. It works using server side rendering. It doesn’t need javascript enabled on the client. Best of all, you don’t need to rewrite every component to handle styling. As an addd bonus, it’s really fast to develop on: anytime you’re working on the server, just run your production build so you don’t need to recompile your client side on every restart.
I hope this gave you the confidence to try more aggressive webpack configs. Go ahead and check out the Meatier repo and if you have any questions or suggestions, don’t be afraid to reach out.

The rise of the SaaS model in the product space has been swift, to say the least. So as product managers, knowing how to manage only traditional, on-premises software no longer cuts it.
We chatted with six experts (i.e. SaaS product managers) to find out how their role differs from an “old-school” software PM — and more importantly, what it really takes to be a SaaS PM. Breaking down everything from must-have skills to those special metrics to up-and-coming trends within the space, these insights from SaaS veterans can prepare any PM looking to enter (or those already in) the SaaS space.
Here’s who we spoke with:
Title: Principal Product ManagerCompany: AtlassianConnect with him: Twitter or LinkedIn
How does SaaS product management differ from traditional software product management?
The nature of SaaS implies that your customer is constantly re-evaluating your product — weekly, monthly, or yearly. Switching has become easier. And for a PM, differentiation becomes more critical. It’s a reminder to go back to the basics of ensuring we’re solving the right problems to create products that customers love.
If there was one thing a SaaS PM needed (tool, process, skill, etc.) to survive, what would it be?
For any PM, I think it’s the art of discernment. Looking at a problem carefully from all angles to pave the right path forward. Empathy is critical in that process — putting the customer at the center of your decision.
As a SaaS PM, how are you measuring success?
When a PM can go on vacation and trust the team to make the right decisions for the customer, that’s success in my book! It means that the PM has done a great job of communicating the problem and metrics of success for that project.
The data you focus on seems to be a key differentiator in SaaS product management. What’s the top metric a SaaS PM should focus on?
The AARRR framework is always a solid starting point: acquisition, activation, retention, referral and revenue. For example, take referral. Your job as a PM would be to move the business forward by building a product your customers love so much that they’re recommending it to their friends over and over again. A clear goal that impacts business.
From your time as a SaaS PM, what is a mistake you actively try to avoid today?
All of the time I wasted chasing the perfect product! I’m a perfectionist. It took me far too long to realize that a team could deliver more value to customers by shipping the first version than by sitting around perfecting it. Cast the vision, build the version. Keep iterating, keep shipping!
What’s one way to guarantee failure as a SaaS PM?
Never talking to your customers. And treating them as a number…or a dollar sign.
Title: Product ManagerCompany: ScribbleLiveConnect with her: Twitter or LinkedIn
How does SaaS product management differ from on-premises software product management?
I’ve always worked on SaaS products — so I can’t speak to personal experiences on both sides — but there are definitely different revenue considerations. There are also different expectations regarding customizations you can offer.
We’re not creating one-off versions of software; we’re creating scalable, fast solutions. So as a SaaS PM, you want to build open and flexible products. This way different use cases can leverage the same features, but in various ways.
You mentioned different expectations regarding customizations. Can you expand on how user expectations differ for SaaS products?
For customers more used to enterprise or custom-built software, they might expect one-off customizations or features they can heavily customize. Also, they expect software to release differently. The cadence of how often we release new software — or new features — to clients is definitely different than offering an update to clients a couple times a year. So we need to offer a different level of training and hands-on approach from our client teams too.
Walk us through how you measure success as a SaaS PM.
There’s a bunch of different ways. To name a few:
What’s one way to ensure failure as a SaaS PM?
I’d say lack of passion for your product. If you don’t care about the product or clients you’re building for, I’d say move on to a different role!
What trends are emerging in SaaS product management?
The evolution of single-product services or point solutions to larger platforms. Clients are looking to consolidate vendors and have more integrated solutions. For mature startups, this may come through in software acquisitions or new internal product builds.
Title: Senior Product ManagerCompany: ZendeskConnect with him: Twitter or LinkedIn
What are the main differences between SaaS product management and traditional software product management?
My whole PM career has been in SaaS, so I can’t share first-hand experience on differences. But observing PMs who’ve transitioned, the biggest difference is development speed and frequency of deploying to customers. Also roadmap flexibility. The roadmap changes more often in SaaS, meaning more communication with stakeholders.
If you needed a tool or process or skill to survive as a SaaS PM, what would it be?
Strong data analysis and understanding of how to query data from databases. Funnel and segmentation analysis is key to SaaS product optimization. Focus on understanding data more generally and teach yourself how to write SQL queries. These skills will pay off tenfold.
How should a SaaS PM measure success?
Ultimately, a healthy SaaS funnel is one that has a low and sustainable churn rate with customers who are promoters. From emerging startups to medium-sized companies, organic referrals will always be critical to adoption of new features and a business’ overall success.
Since metrics are a big differentiator in SaaS product management, what would you say is the top metric for a SaaS PM?
I manage both web and mobile products, so I approach each slightly differently. For web, I primarily focus on net promoter score (NPS) and its trend over time, broken down by customer segment and persona type.
For mobile, I look at weekly retention rates by cohort to ensure we’re keeping new app users engaged over time. I also closely monitor and respond to ratings/reviews from the App Store and Google Play Store.
Let’s talk trends in SaaS product management. Anything you’re noticing?
Business funnels will have new emerging front doors such as conversational experiences on 3rd party platforms, like Facebook Messenger in North America and LINE/WeChat in Asia.
Within constraints of these conversational/bot platforms, copywriting is becoming even more important for feature or product design. Copywriting is not a common skill associated with PMs but it’s a great skill to have and there are some good books to help grow that muscle. (Persuasive copywriting was recommended to me early in my career.)
Title: Principal Product ManagerCompany: OracleConnect with her: LinkedIn
How does SaaS product management differ from traditional software product management?
In SaaS environments you need to keep existing customers so they continue to pay for your service. Every release must be easy-to-use, provide value for your customers and not frustrate them. When making significant changes to existing functionality, the PM should understand the customer impact so as not to lose any users.
In my experience, SaaS applications tend to have faster release cycles. You constantly need to talk to your customers and gather data so you can quickly iterate on the product.
What’s one thing (tool, process, skill, etc.) a SaaS PM needs to survive?
Curiosity and defined overall vision. Always ask questions, don’t make assumptions and do research to make the right decisions for your product area. Know what you’re building and why, so you can quickly adapt to changes and still get valuable features out the door.
How do you measure success as a SaaS PM?
Depends on the goal of your product area, but in general successful adoption plus retention of your product in the market.
How do you guarantee failure as a SaaS PM?
While getting metrics on the product is always key, it’s important to remember ‘the why.’ Why are your customers using the product this way? How are they using the product to do whatever they need to do? Getting data is one thing; understanding the data and your customers is another.
Any key trends you see popping up in SaaS product management?
With recent political developments within the U.S. and the low Canadian dollar, I’m hearing more tech companies consider opening offices north of the border. And on the flip side, I’m hearing more PMs wanting to stay in Canada.
In the enterprise space, I’m hearing more about the right balance between agile and a fully defined roadmap (enterprise agile).
Title: Director of Product ManagementCompany: ZuoraConnect with him: Twitter or LinkedIn
As a SaaS PM, what is the one tool/process/skill you need to survive?
It’s not necessarily a tool, but staying sharp with technology and having a holistic view of technologies around you. Your goal as a PM is to offer an end-to-end experience.
How do you measure success as a SaaS PM?
Profitability and cash growth. My general rule of thumb is if your LTV is at least four times your CAC, you can recover the CAC in less than a year. It varies though and is not a hard-and-fast rule.
At much bigger, more mature companies, look at profitability per employee, so you don’t overgrow what you can’t afford. With smaller companies, growth should never be a separate entity. It should be a responsibility of every employee to grow the company.
Looking back at your SaaS PM career, any cringe worthy moments or mistakes you’d avoid today?
Hiring mistakes. I try not to fall in love with logos, pedigrees, that kind of stuff. But sometimes you might end up hiring somebody just for the “Google” name on the resume and they end up not meeting the expectations.
Also, I’m currently working on the pricing model here at Zuora. There is no one-size-fits-all; it’s an ongoing exercise. You cannot price it and then fight your way to get pricing right. Keep iterating.
How can a SaaS PM set themselves up for failure?
This applies to any PM, but forgetting the fundamental thing you’re solving. It resonates with “build it and they will come.” Don’t. Because they won’t come.
Also scope creep. You can build the biggest thing ever and end up with the biggest failure ever. You’re not going to build something 100% right. 80% (or even less sometimes) is good enough.
Any significant trends in SaaS product management?
I do see vertical and horizontal SaaS scaling. Companies are going into specific industries (real estate, finance, etc.) or establishing themselves as role-specific (marketing, sales, etc.). Many start from the intersection of these two orientations and try to capture the whole area.
Also, it’s a little early, but I see a lot of interest in UI-less SaaS platforms. Trying to use already existing channels such as bots, messengers, emails, calendars, as primary delivery communication mechanisms. SaaS businesses aren’t concentrating on single entry points.
Title: Product Management Consultant and CEOCompany: Sure Product ConsultingConnect with her: Twitter or LinkedIn
What’s the difference between SaaS product management and traditional software product management?
From my perspective — and I work mainly in B2B enterprise software — SaaS product management is now traditional. The B2B world has been mostly web-based since 2000, but customers managed servers in their own data centers. Nowadays, customers subscribe to cloud-based services and servers are managed by us.
With SaaS, I work with DevOps. I rarely think about simplifying the upgrade and migration process of server products because DevOps handles it; customers don’t have to. Before I used to track a giant matrix of what operating system-database-application server combinations were “supported” configurations for our product. I still do this a little, but it’s so much easier.
Is there a specific metric a SaaS PM should focus on to measure success?
I have different types of clients so it’s different for all of them. But when I help a Head of Product decide which metrics they should monitor, I suggest tracking the number of meaningful customer contacts each PM has per week. It fundamentally changes PM behaviour. Usually they’re not tracking it, so measuring it gets PMs prioritizing listening to customers.
Looking back at your time as a SaaS PM specifically, any cringe worthy moments you feel like you could avoid today?
Yeah, of course! If you’ve read my blog it’s full of many of my cringe worthy moments, I’m sure.
Specific to SaaS, there’s the mistake where you roll out an incorrect change. With SaaS, once you roll out a change everybody has it, right? So it’s more of an emergency than if you just published the link to the latest download. In SaaS, sometimes you think you’ve tested the heck out of something and then immediately you’re rolling it back.
What trends are popping up in the SaaS product management space?
User experience is becoming ever more important (a welcome change for enterprise B2B products, where the UIs were often horrible!).
I also see SaaS PMs think about how to analyze the large amounts of data their products collect. Sometimes this analysis can be so valuable to customers that you can charge for it as a new product.
SaaS or traditional, any product manager can benefit from a roadmap. Our template library makes it simple to align your entire organization on product strategy — whatever your delivery model.

Three to four million people buy Starbucks coffee every day. And in the US alone, there are more than 250M cups of coffee of any brand purchased on a daily basis. That’s a lot of freaking caffeine. And it doesn’t even include homebrew.
But it wasn’t always so.
Habits are hard to build and harder to break. And when it comes to business and profitability, the one thing that trumps a habit is an addiction. And if coffee is anything, it’s addictive. It makes you feel great, more productive. and, over time, your tolerance increases. From a small to a medium, a large to multiple cups a day, coffee can become an all-consuming need you can’t function without.
And that’s exactly how you want to build and market your business, especially in B2B.
Coffee is addictive, but so is heroin. That said, it’s a lot easier to get someone to try a cup of joe than to clamp a vein and jab.
There are many reasons, but some of the more important are ease of access, ease of use, additional hits (i.e., upsells), cost, risk, and social stigma. And each is critical to building a killer viral product.
Before there was a Starbucks on every corner, there was a coffee pot in every home. And before that, somehow, people functioned without coffee…
The law of induced demand basically says that the easier it is to do something favorable/enjoyable, the more likely people are to do it. It’s the reason your waist expands when there are cookies in the house and why we order too much junk from Amazon’s one-click wonder.
The easier it is to get someone to try something, the easier it is to get them hooked.
Look at Slack and Salesforce. That’s as bottom-up vs. top-down as it gets. With Slack, a team signs up and starts chatting, and soon the entire company is on board. It’s free to sign up to, sets limits on usage, and allows anyone with a pulse an easy interface to get work done.
It doesn’t take much.
No one likes to feel dumb, so keep it simple, stupid.
Complexity kills conversions. It takes a team to set up Salesforce or InfusionSoft, and an army to run it. That’s a lot of hours and a big commitment.
Products that succeed virally don’t require hand-holding. They’re fast, easy, and intuitive, and they grant early wins. How quickly can you hook someone?
“At Facebook, if we could get someone to seven friends in ten days, they’d stick.” — Mark Zuckerburg
What are your sticky metrics? What’s the level of lock-in/winning that an ideal customer needs to experience (and in what timeframe?) to keep on them on the caffeine train?
And how can you build your product or onboarding to get businesses from A) to adept as efficiently as possible.
Powerful functionality often requires complexity but to take advantage of that takes time. The sooner a business integrates your product or service into their workflow, the less likely they are to ever leave.
It’s the free sample strategy, and Starbucks does this wonderfully. How often do they come around carrying trays of new treats or drinks? You could put on the pounds just sampling the ever-changing array. And that’s exactly the point.
Samples are an upsell —an easy, addictive way to get you to buy more. But presented in such a friendly way, they just seem nice.
B2B businesses could learn a thing or two from the baristas. How can you constantly offer new products and perks to your existing customers? It’s much easier (and cheaper) to upsell than acquire new.
Slack scales with team size. Oracle offers a million and one services. Some companies add higher and higher tiers of hand-holding support.
Whatever it is for you, think about how your product/service is positioned and what else you could offer. And most importantly, get creative with The Ask.
“Hey, Bob, we’re rolling out a new AI-powered autoresponder for sales. Since you’ve been a longtime customer, we’d love to hook you up with three months free…”
Once you’re in, if it’s valuable/addictive enough, no company will roll back your really nifty service. Who wants to go back to answering their own emails?
Nothing beats free. And freemium can be a great way to go. But so too can cheap or free-for-a-time. The cable companies are notorious for introductory pricing, and people hate them for it. But Starbucks raises prices $0.10 and no one says a thing. It’s addiction, it’s habit. I need my coffee.
And like Netflix’s incremental increases, if you’ve locked a business or a consumer into your product offering, it’ll take a lot more than a small price hike to push them over the edge.
Cost is really a function of upsells and overhead. And it will determine your go-to-market strategy. A freemium-based sales force isn’t going to fly.
But if you’ve built a business with multiple tiers/upgrades, a funnel focused on maximizing customers and driving them further down the value chain can prove massively profitable.
Coffee’s pretty mild. Heroin, not so much. And while the analogy isn’t perfect, the same is true of Slack and Salesforce. There are products and services we know we don’t want to use.
The addictive ones are especially problematic, and for many, especially in the business side of things, we avoid like the plague.
It’s usually due to complexity, time commitment, or potential for failure.
And for startups, the failure rate is huge. That’s why many enterprises avoid buying from upstarts like it’s an ideology. They’ve seen too many come and go to risk their business’s future on a flier. You need to be established and demonstrate credibility to make the big sale. That means case studies, testimonials, and customer referrals.
But investment and media coverage also de-risk a business, at least from the perspective of established players. The more money you’ve raised or the more Mashable articles featuring your cool tech, the less likely mid-level managers are to get fired/flack for using your service. No one ever got fired for buying IBM.
Friends make the best salesmen. And how many cups of coffee do you see a day? Coffee meetings are the norm these days, and the coffee machine’s trumped the watercooler as the hangout of choice. There’s more pressure around drinking coffee than any other drink, except perhaps beer at a bar.
And if everyone else is doing it (and getting a productivity advantage), wouldn’t you be foolish not to try? Maybe there’s something to this whole coffee cult.
The same could certainly be said of Zendesk, Intercom or Mailchimp. Anything to increase efficiency.
And many businesses build this stigma/social sharing right into their product. Want to use Mailchimp’s free version? There’s gonna be a monkey logo in the bottom right of your emails. Using Box or Dropbox for file storage? Same deal when you share projects with collaborators and clients.
It’s a brilliant little bit of virality built right into the product.
Howard Schultz engineered something special with Starbucks. He built a scalable, saleable franchise that attracts aficionados and casual coffee drinkers alike. And he did it by building systems, iterating, and focusing on every little detail.
There’s a lot for founders to learn. Here are the basics.
As I write this, I’m sitting in a Starbucks, sipping coffee. I work from here almost every day. And rather than making me feel alienated for taking up space, the staff knows me by name, says hi, and enjoys my presence. How’s that compare to calling Bluehost or your bank?
Places to sit, coffee-themed creative art, relaxing music for ambiance — the more you’re able to get your customers to hang out in/around your product (or company), the better. Slack and Salesforce users have the applications open constantly. When something becomes your home/hub, you’d do just about anything to avoid being evicted.
How many businesses would grind to a halt without Gmail?
What could you do to make your product more core to your customers’ workdays?
Remember those punch cards? Coffeeshops and pizza parlors used to give customers a freebie every five or ten visits. Starbucks did the same, before their app. Now their loyalty program is the envy of every retailer. Customers download and pre-load the app, receiving minimal incentives (short of free refills), and love every minute of it.
They can order ahead, skip the line, and take that first refreshing sip faster, every time. Plus Starbucks can avoid the 3% credit card fees. It’s a win-win. Plus Starbucks gets your data and a direct channel to market to its millions of customers.
This strategy can be harder to adapt but incredibly valuable if you pull it off. Generally speaking, a simple loyalty program won’t cut it. Everyone has one. What makes your’s special?
Here, I’d recommend freebie upsells again: “Thanks again for supporting us. How about a five-month free upgrade?”
Or, another strategy, the prepay: “Buy ten months and the last two are on us.”
The upfront purchase helps cash flow and can be a great tool to increase LTV/average retention.
Upselling sweets is a little easier than additional services, but the concept’s the same. As you’re waiting in line to order, you’re assaulted by tasty treats your body craves. And coincidentally, businesses also crave things: increased revenues and quick fixes especially.
What are the obvious upsells you have, and how are you positioning them in the checkout process to increase your LTV? Are you pushy, or simply putting them out there?
Starbucks doesn’t shove prepackaged muffins down your throat, and neither should you. At the same time, if you don’t offer, they aren’t buying.
Amazon does a good job of this, offering upsells as suggestions. Other customers also bought… “I’m like other customers, right? Maybe this is perfect for me.” It feels automated and authentic for some reason; it feels helpful.
Visual aesthetics are important here. Make your nudge less intrusive and fit into the flow, and you’ll find increased success.
To have a one-click checkout, you need turnkey products. The more hand-holding or customization a product or service requires, the harder it is to scale. That’s why Starbucks doesn’t make fresh food. It’s fast food in the simplest sense of the word (hence how they serve 500–750 people a day per location).
One-off offerings take time and cut down on conversions. And to scale, every little optimization counts, leading to exponential results in the long run. (Counting cards in blackjack only yields an advantage of several percent over the house, but it’s enough to make it banned in every major casino.)
The same applies to pricing tiers: the fewer and simpler, the better.
For most businesses, price anchoring around the low, medium, and high tiers yield the best results (the highest LTV). “I can’t afford the Porsche but don’t want the Ford Focus… how about a Camry?”
This is especially important when it comes to product overwhelm. The more options consumers/businesses are presented with, the harder it is to choose the right one.
Have a million options? That’s why ecommerce stores feature the most popular products first, masking the complexity behind algorithms and additional searches.
There are a lot of things that go into creating a viral, addictive product or service that businesses bake so far into their systems they’re unable to ever escape. But those are the keys to true profitability and longevity. And they’re there for the taking.
Which of the strategies fit your startup? Any thoughts on other coffee-esque creative ways to capture your ideal customer?
So, what do you think? I hope you take a second next time you step into a Starbucks (or any other store for that matter) to see what they’re doing right and what could be improved, and steal the best strategies for your business.
That’s innovation, really: finding what works from whatever source and building upon it in your own way. Go pirate your way to profits!
The more you seek out ways to scale, the more successful you’ll be building something incredible.

At seed-stage, you don’t have many customers. You’re trying to get whoever comes into the front door. Thus, it might sound crazy to “reject” or “fire” some potential customers …
But at this early stage, it’s very important to find the “right” customers for you.
You want somebody who is aligned with your priorities in the short term.
About this seriesThis series of articles are drafted from our experience at Point Nine Capital on the top priorities for early-stage SaaS companies. Note that though more relevant for startups who focus on SMBs first and then go upmarket, the priorities are general enough to apply to most SaaS companies.
Please, welcome early adopters on stage!
Early adopters check most the of following characteristics:
You can see why early adopters are a gem!
And what’s more important, they actually exist. It’s quite hard to find them, but if you find one, keep it as a treasure.
Usually, you can find people who behave like early adopters among the people who trust you — your network, your business angels and investors and their portfolios, companies and alumni in your same incubator/accelerator, etc.
Once you run out of contacts through that, luckily, there are some places like Product Hunt or BetaList where early adopters like to hang around.
What’s even more important: make it a personal thing between you and them to succeed. With a handful of those customers you will iterate faster, which is key to find product market fit sooner.
It’s quite common that startups sell to other startups as early adopters.
This, in principle, is great because startups are early adopters by definition. But:
In general, there are some other good principles that can help you hire or fire customers:
At this early stage, pleasing tech companies can be enough to get decent traction. In most cases, with that traction you can raise funding and then expand into more use cases.
The smaller the niche you focus on initially, the easier it becomes to please them. But that comes with the risk of your market perceived as a niche.
There’s two main ways you can expand your market:
If your business and industry allows it, every time you close a customer, try to look for a bigger one (x2). If you can’t serve them yet, learn what it would take to get them onboard. Going across industries tends to be harder than going upmarket — even if both things are really hard!
Once you get a handful of customer in the same industry, try to repeat the trick in different industries. Even if today there’s no real chances of winning customers there, try to speak with them and understand their needs.
At this early stage, thinking about pleasing one kind of customer at a time brings great benefits! It will clear your vision, therefore it will be a lot easier to prioritize your roadmap, your sales, your customer success, etc.
Many founders don’t want to do consulting to customers because they think it won’t scale. Yes, consulting business are known for that.
But, if you’re not deeply familiar with the problem you’re solving, consulting can be a good hack.
You can build your product by doing consulting at the office of your customers. You will be getting feedback all the time and you will see their willingness to pay first hand. This is basically another way of putting: do things that don’t scale.
This is a common one: a large-ish company wants your product, but only if you go on-premise. “Because they don’t trust the cloud” or “You’re too small and can die” or whatever other reason.
There several reasons why you shouldn’t go on-premise so early, among others:
For your comfort: we have seen several times that the that “customer who only wanted on-premise” becomes a SaaS customer.
If you solve a real problem for them, they will take “the risk” of going cloud. If you don’t, then they will keep finding excuses to avoid you and on-premise is a pretty comfortable one.
Building a startup is something f**king hard. Founders know that and they try to help each other. But, unfortunately, I’ve seen often that this turns into startups not paying for other startups’ products.
Let’s be honest, if your “startup customers” don’t pay for your product it’s probably because the pain point is not big enough for them. If it’s not relevant, then it’s only vanity and it won’t help you. I’ve seen many early stage startups paying big bills to New Relic. Why do they pay to New Relic and not to you?
Thus, if you have users who don’t pay for your product, make sure you have a great explanation on why that is. If a “startup customer” is not using your product enough, not providing useful feedback or not bringing good referrals, those might be good reasons to fire them.

Amazon(AWS), Google(Cloud Platform), Microsoft(Azure), IBM(SoftLayer, Bluemix) gibi büyük firmaların bulut hizmetlerindeki servis katmanları birbirleriyle aynı mantıktadır.
Amaç katman katman olan bu yapıların geliştiriciden soyutlanarak herkesin rahatça kullanabileceği ortamlar oluşturmaktır. Aşağıda bu sorumlulukların kimin sorumluluğunda olduğunu anlatan bir resim görmektesiniz.
On-Premises: Yazılımlarının sizin veya firmanın bilgisayarlarına yüklendiği kısımda tüm katmanların sorumluluğu sizin ekibinizin üzerindedir. Bir sistem ekibiniz olması gerekir. Bu sistem ekibi sunucuları, veritabanlarını, güvenliği, network’ü bilmesi ve kurması gerekmektedir. Veritabanının yedeklerinin alınmasını sağlaması, işletim sisteminin güncel sürümlerinin yüklenmesini sağlaması gerekmektedir. Ayrıca sistem ekibinin JVM, dll, plugin gibi yazılımın ihtiyacı olan Run-Time sisteme kurmaları gerekmektedir.
Infrastructure As A Service: Size bulut üzerinden sanal Compute, Storage, Networking satıldığı, kiralandığı bulut hizmeti olarak düşünebilirsiniz. Bilgisayar, Disk ve Network kartları almak yerine bunları Sanal olarak bulut’tan kiralayıp üzerine istediğiz işletim sistemini kurup yolunuza devam edebilirsiniz.
Platform As A Service: Bulut üzerinde direk bir java, ruby, node uygulaması geliştirmek istiyorsunuz ve işletim sistemi, network, sunucu gibi sistemler ile uğraşmak istemiyorsunuz, Sadece uygulamanızı geliştirmek ile uğraşıyorsunuz sonrada uygulamanızın run-time dosyalarını ilgili platforma atıp çalışmasını sağlıyorsunuz.
Software As A Service: Uygulamaların bulut’tan hizmet vermesine SaaS denir. Kullanıcılar sadece uygulama arayüzlerine erişebilir. Kendilerine ait bilgileri bu yazılımlara girerek, bilgilerini bulut üzerinde saklar ve buradan kullanırlar.
Örneğin: GoogleDocs, Evernote uygulamalar SaaS olarak düşünebiliriz.
Uzun süredir farklı sektörlerde (Askeri, Telekomünikasyon, Devlet, Bankacılık, Sigortacılık, Tübitak, SaaS) yazılımlar geliştiriyorum. Bu süreçte Havelsan, Milsoft, T2, Cybersoft ve Thundra firmalarında yönetici ve yazılım mühendisi olarak çalıştım. Deneyimlerimi ve teknolojik bilgi birikimi mi olabildiğince OnurDayibasi.com adresinde toplamaya çalışıyorum. Tüm yazılarıma ve daha fazlasını bu site üzerinden erişebilirsiniz.

Be the first to respond.
We will be coming next month with a white paper on the seven strategies for scaling SMB SaaS companies. In the meantime, here are four key insights I have observed in the trenches for scaling in SMB.
Small business owners wear many hats. From the biggest decisions to the most menial tasks, they are responsible for all it. Despite all the advances in technology, business owners are as pressed for time as ever. This has important implications for how you build software for them.
If your software is complex and requires high engagement from the business owner in order to see the value, it will fail. There are only two paradigms that work for the time-strapped business owner: automation or do it for me.
Automation — with machine learning getting better every day, one clear path for software design is to build simple black boxes. Software that does one thing very well. No engagement required. I just trust it and it works.
Do it for me — Not all software can be reduced down to fully automated solutions (yet). More complex software needs to be matched with service providers that can do the work for the small business owner. In many cases such as accounting and website design, the market for services around the software is many times larger than the market for the software itself.
This is where the bulk of the market is. Recognize that the small business owner has no time and make sure you offer the complete solution that the owner can pay for without incurring additional demands on her time.
2. Growing fast is expensive
According to the Kaufmann foundation, there are 3 million new businesses started every year. This creates a large, evergreen market. Presumably some number of those businesses will need your software.
However, to grow at 2x or more of the natural growth rate of the overall market requires paid customer acquisition. SMB SaaS math relies on a heavy dose of organic (free) user acquisition. If the ratio of free vs. paid acquisition skews too much towards paid then your overall blended CAC starts to climb. Given the lower revenue that comes from SMB customers, your overall customer math can start to go off.
This is why many early stage VCs struggle with the SMB market. It is hard to grow at the rates they are looking for (2x, 3x per year).
3. NPS is key
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a key measure in any business, but particularly in ones that serve SMB. This is because, as already mentioned, SMB SaaS companies rely on free organic customer acquisition to make their overall unit economics work.
The key to driving high NPS in SMB is to offer customers the complete solution — a great, simple product, matched with great customer support.
Many companies think they can’t offer support to SMB customers. The reverse is true. If you don’t offer support, you will be out of business. These customers have no IT deparment. You are their IT department. Offer the complete solution and drive your NPS.
Make sure to continually measure NPS. Many companies do it in app every month.
4 Help your customers grow
Over the years I have seen two broad buckets of SaaS applications — ones that save the user time and ones that make the user money.
Time savers/ productivity applications are everywhere. Ultimately, with these products you are competing with the status quo (or more specifically with MS Excel). The bulk of the market just doesn’t feel the pain accutely enough to bother subscribing for your product. It’s hard to build a big, meaningful company when all you do is save your users time.
Conversely, every business wants to grow. If you actually make users money then they will never turn you off. Find ways to help your customers grow their businesses!

A couple weeks ago, I shared a chart with the stock performance of recent tech IPOs along with this tweet:
there are two dominant startup models in tech today. (1) You can make money selling software. (2) You can lose money selling anything else.
Lots of people wrote back, and one person pointed out that a better metric to look at (than stock price) would be revenue vs. capital raised. He also pointed me to this fantastic TechCrunch article with the data, so here is a closer look at the efficiency of different businesses models, thanks to Boris!

Top highlight
About two years ago I thought about the question of what it takes to raise capital, in SaaS, in 2016 and tried to give an answer that would fit on the proverbial back of a napkin. The result was the “SaaS Funding Napkin”, a virtual one initially, followed before too long by a real napkin that made regular appearances (and friends) at SaaS conferences around the world. A year ago I created an update for 2017. Now it’s time for the 2018 version.
In the previous two years, the data that I’ve put on the napkin was based on what we had seen in the market and anecdotal feedback from a few other investors. For this year’s update, I decided to broaden the dataset by sending out a Typeform to a much larger number of SaaS investors. As a result, the data is now based on a much larger sample size and should provide a fairly accurate answer to the question asked in the headline above.
As I have quite a lot of data to present, I’ll split this article into three parts. In this post, part 1, I’ll start with some brief, general information about the survey and will then dig into the quantitative answers. In part 2, which will be published tomorrow, I’ll turn to the free-form answers, and in part 3 you’ll get the updated napkin. Ready to go?
The first question was “Which stage are you focused on?”, because we wanted to ask people a different set of subsequent questions depending on whether they invest at the seed stage or at later stages.
For Series A/B/C investors, the first part of the Typeform then looked like this:
From seed investors we wanted to know:
After that we asked all investors a couple of additional, optional questions:
These questions were the same for seed and Series A/B/C investors, but where you see “seed/A/B/C” above, the wording was customized based on the answer we received at the beginning of the survey. Fortunately, these customizations and “logic jumps” are super easy to set up with Typeform!
Here’s the Typeform that we sent out, in case you’d like to take a look.
In total, we got responses from more than 60 VCs, including many of the industry’s most active and most respected SaaS investors in Europe (Accel, Acton, Alven, Connect Ventures, Creandum, Dawn, DN Capital, EQT, eVentures, Idinvest, Index, Localglobe, MMC, Mosaic, Notion, Northzone, Partech, Runa, Sunstone) and the US (Access, Battery, Benchmark, Bessemer, Canaan, CRV, Emergence, Floodgate, General Catalyst, GGV, Homebrew, IA, Icon, Iconiq, Insight, KPCB, Matrix, Meritech, NVP, OpenView, Redpoint, Salesforce Ventures, Sapphire, Scale, Shasta, SignalFire, SV Angel, Uncork, Upfront, Valar). A big thank-you to everyone who took the time to participate!
In statistical terms, 60 is not a large sample size. However, since we’re talking about the constituents of a small, highly competitive and extremely well-connected market, I’m quite confident that the results are pretty representative for the market at large. We didn’t get enough data points from Series C investors, though, and have therefore not included Series C data in the results.
But enough about the background of the survey, let’s take a look at the results!
1. How much ARR — quite roughly — do you expect a SaaS company to have when it raises its Series A/B/C round?
Most Series A investors expect a little over $1M in ARR, while most Series B investors are looking for around $5M in ARR:
Note that there are a few outliers: Two Series A VCs said they expect $3M and another one said $2.5M, which is significantly more than what at least one of the Series B investors expect.
2. What kind of y/y ARR growth gets you excited when you’re considering an investment?
As you can see in the table above, growth expectations are as high as they’ve ever been:
That doesn’t mean that none of these investors will ever invest into a company with a slower growth rate. It does mean, though, that if you’re growing less fast, there need to be other, extremely compelling reasons to invest. It also means that lots and lots of SaaS startups will struggle to raise their next round of financing — a topic my colleagues and I covered extensively on this blog. (Check out, for example, Clément’s post about “The Rise of ‘non VC compatible’ SaaS Companies”.)
3. And what kind of y/y ARR growth do you expect in the 12 months following your investment?
As you can see, growth expectations for the 12 months after the investment are a little lower compared to the 12 months leading to the investment, which of course makes sense, as it’s hard to keep growing at the same rate when you reach larger scale. Here’s a chart that visualizes the change in growth expectations pre vs. post investment:
As you can see, the decline is stronger at the Series B than at the Series A stage. At the time of the investment, most Series B investors expect a SaaS company to grow 3x more. For the 12 months after the investment, most of them are happy with 2–2.5x. Keep in mind, though, that this is based on eleven Series B respondents only, so the data set for this subset is quite small.
Here’s another way to look at the data:
In this chart, each bubble represents an intersection on the s̶p̶a̶c̶e̶/̶t̶i̶m̶e̶ ARR/growth continuum. A larger bubble means that the ARR/growth pair has been mentioned multiple times. As mentioned above, the data set is very small for later-stage investors, but with a little bit of goodwill you can a spot a trend towards lower growth rates and smaller variance for later stages: 😜
Mathematically speaking, the correlation between ARR expectation and growth expectation is -0.23, so there is a significant yet quite weak, negative relationship between the two values.
“What are the things you are looking for in a SaaS seed round?”
As a reminder, we asked seed investors to rate five criteria on a scale from 1 (not important) to 5 (extremely important). Here are the results:
As you can see, most of the seed investors we asked didn’t give very high ratings for Product/Market Fit, paying customers and revenue. Founders with a proven track record are somewhat important to most seed investors, but the highest rating by far got the strong technical co-founder. It looks like most seed investors are willing to take a large — maybe surprisingly large — degree of market risk (as in, will the dogs eat the dog food); but they want to minimize the amount of tech risk (as in, can the team produce the dog food). For what it’s worth, a strong tech co-founder is a must-have for us at Point Nine, too.
I mentioned above that if a seed investor rated “revenue” with three or more stars, he or she received a followup question, asking how much ARR they roughly expect at the seed round stage. Five investors were in that category, and they all mentioned a number around $100k in ARR, give or take.
Our question regarding average pre-money valuations and average round sizes got 45 answers. Here are the results:
One observation is that while my recent analysis of publicly available SaaS funding data suggested that most seed rounds are significantly below $1M, the average round size in our survey was $1.6M. This discrepancy might be due to our small sample size, especially because our sample of seed investors is probably biased towards larger seed funds that tend to write bigger checks.
Let’s take a look at how the valuation answers are distributed:
My take-aways:
Finally, we can merge the valuation data with the ARR data to get a sense for the correlation between ARR and valuation and to take a look at ARR multiples. This again needs to be taken with a grain of salt, because the data is not based on individual funding rounds but on what investors told us about their averages for ARR and valuation across all their deals in 2017. So let’s have a look at this, but let’s not take it too seriously:
According to these data points, there is a very strong (positive) correlation between ARR and valuation, +0.83 to be precise. While not surprising in principle, it’s worth pointing out that if we remove the four data points from the upper right corner of the chart, the correlation drops to +0.37. In other words, if you have much more in ARR you’ll most likely get a much higher valuation; but in the $1–3M ARR range, the correlation is much weaker.
As a corollary to this, the range of ARR multiples that we can calculate for these ARR/valuation pairs varies widely:
As you can see, the range is very broad. There is some concentration in the ~11–13.5 area, but even if I take all data points between 9 and 15, they account for less than half of all answers. There are several potential reasons which might explain the perhaps surprisingly wide range. For example, while later-stage rounds tend to be prices based on ARR multiples, this isn’t always the case for earlier stage rounds.
Congratulations if you’ve made it this far. :) The next two parts of this series will be much lighter, promised!

Last year, 2017, saw a slight slow-down in the pace of new SaaS subscriptions, but an increase in the amount being spent on SaaS. So while it may look like we are starting to see some consolidation around tools, it’s also true that organizations are not shy about shelling out for software as a service that will help them grow and manage their businesses.
It’s important to pay close attention to how software is being used in the modern business, because it’s the backbone of our economy today. Understanding SaaS trends can help businesses make good decisions about where to invest their own money. Additionally, digging deep on what’s working and what’s not can help uncover opportunities to improve.
As we’ve written about before, SaaS security has a long way to go. Additionally, there are often major opportunities for cost savings when teams pay attention to where they are investing their dollars to avoid feature overlap and optimize resources. Productivity can either be dramatically improved or hampered by technology, depending on how workflows are structured, so periodically evaluating your SaaS usage (and taking a look at the wider industry) is a good way to understand whether you are moving in the right direction.
Overall, it’s a good idea to pay attention to where SaaS momentum lies before you make any big decisions about where to invest, where to cut back, and how to better integrate and structure the technology your team already uses. Our hope is that this guide will help you do just that.
The last ten years have resulted in a penetration of SaaS across all departments. While engineering was an unsurprising early frontrunner, and still a spending leader, Business Ops has taken the crown when it comes to number of subscriptions recent years. In 2018, it’s clear that SaaS is used widely across the entire organization.
On average, we are seeing 18 SaaS subscriptions and about $136,000 in total spend at each company. However, it’s worth noting that as of Q3 2017, the run rate was closer to 20 subscriptions and $186,000 in annualized spending, so we expect these numbers to grow in 2018, just as they have in previous years.
Let’s take a look at a departmental breakdown in SaaS usage and trends.
Engineering teams are naturally powered by technology, and since they are of course the pioneers of SaaS, it makes sense that they were the first to jump in headlong. Of course, there’s some overlap between engineering and DevOps, but here are the top three favorite products among pure-engineering teams:
Just behind engineering, business ops stands out as a heavy user of SaaS products. It makes a lot of sense. Business ops pros are charged with keeping the whole organization humming along smoothly, and investing in tools that streamline, simplify, and facilitate communication is at the heart of what they do. Here are the top three business ops SaaS applications:
As marketing becomes an increasingly technical and KPI-focused discipline, it’s no surprise that technology has been relied upon to support growth. This ranges from the big marketing automation platforms to a plethora of tailored solutions for everything from landing pages to design. Some of the top SaaS products for marketers include:
If your customers are tech-savvy, you certainly better be as well. It took a little while for customer support teams to start adopting SaaS. In 2017, but it’s clear that the SaaS tools they are using are making a big difference. Customers today expect excellent support, and doing this at scale quite simply requires good technology. Some favorites for customer support include:
Time to get your financial house in order? In 2018, you’d be hard-pressed to do this successfully without the support of some excellent SaaS finance tools. While security and compliance concerns (and perhaps a bit of an old-school attitude) led to slow growth in this department — it has clearly taken off in recent years. The best apps for their money?
Building a SaaS product? You’re gonna want some SaaS products to help you manage the process…In fact, even companies who aren’t building technology themselves can benefit from some of the powerful product development and management tools on the market today. Below are three popular SaaS tools for product teams:
DevOps teams are natural early adopters, since they’re steeped in technology. Since DevOps teams are tasked with both development and operations tasks, it makes sense that their SaaS investments span the gamut, with a focus on simplifying infrastructure to support continuous application delivery. Here are some stand-out SaaS tools that DevOps teams rely on:
Human resources teams have been the slowest to start adopting SaaS. Recent growth comes from increasingly well-operationalized HR processes (like onboarding and offboarding) that require support in the form of technology to keep them running smoothly. Some big hits with HR professionals include:
Sales teams are continually measured and KPI’d on how fast, efficiently, and effectively they are able to sell. There’s always room for improvement and an opportunity to trim the fat. Technology can be a huge enabler here. The three most popular SaaS tools for sales are:
The SaaS explosion is a good thing. It’s easier to deploy and faster to adopt, and it doesn’t require IT or developers to get started. Even less tech-savvy team members can deploy many SaaS products. People prefer it because apps can solve a wide range of business challenges. But when an organization invests in a lot of apps, it can lead to chaos pretty quickly.
You have to consider how certain tools get along (or don’t) with other tools. You need to look for ways to streamline tech-heavy workflows. You need to ensure you are meeting security and compliance requirements and responsibilities, and treating customers’ data with the level of respect and sensitivity it deserves. You also need to ensure you are optimizing both operations and spending around SaaS tools, so that proliferation doesn’t equal waste.
Investing in software as a service responsibly means addressing these challenges. That’s the only way to ensure your organization sees a net benefit from all that amazing technology.

A Software as a Service (SaaS) product refers to any software that delivers applications to consumers over the Internet. Unlike regular web or mobile applications that can be downloaded from the operating systems’ accessible library for remote use, a SaaS application is a web-based or hosted application that can be logged in and accessed online without installing and maintaining software.
SaaS B2B companies sell products and services to other companies and not individual users. Popular examples include management software such as Jira, Salesforce, Zendesk, etc. In today’s corporate environment, most B2B SaaS applications are complex scalable applications that are used across a variety of functions in the company with different customizations offered as per the organizational hierarchy. These SaaS products are component-based, outcome-oriented applications that process and store large amounts of data to help businesses achieve more productive outcomes.
The adoption of B2B Saas products follows a different life-cycle since the ticket sizes are higher and most often it demands a shift in habit coupled with the strong motivation and value proposition. Below are some of the primary design based concerns:
Every SaaS-based product is trying to solve one focal problem of the user base which also defines their USP. As a design partner, it’s not enough to understand just one pain-point; one must try to solve the issues arising in the periphery as well. This helps increase the value proposition of SaaS offerings and also serves as a one-stop solution for businesses. As designers, we always need to look at the bigger picture and translate that into features of the application. Data suggests that 52% of users will disengage with an application after an initial bad mobile experience.
The same product services different sets of users who have different needs and technical know-how. The challenge is around the flexibility of the product to meet the needs of various user groups, across hierarchies and functionality to boost each individual group’s productivity criteria. Designing a customizable product that meets such varied needs and understanding can be quite daunting.
CPQ (Cost per Quote) model is very popular now as it empowers users and eases their decision-making process. With a subscription-based model, it is all the more important to capture the interest of the user and deliver the promised value proposition.
The average bounce rate from any website or application for a first time user is about 45%, which means that approximately one in two people click on a website or log in to an app only to leave or ‘bounce’ away from the site.
This happens because the experience is less than favorable for the user and they have decided to look for a product that is a better fit. Hence it’s imperative to structure the user experience right and draw the user in on his/her first visit.
The above challenges clearly point towards the critical importance of having an in-depth understanding of B2B SaaS products. There are ample case studies and user review ratings to suggest that the highest challenge faced by any product team is in understanding the product behavior. As designers, we should spend an ample amount of time researching and understanding not just the obvious pain points but also the oblivious ones. This helps us in defining the value proposition to a greater extent and also in designing an impactful solution like none other. Below we have tried to decode the basics of User Persona Mapping for a B2B SaaS-Based product.
Depending on the Saas Products, we need to understand the businesses, roles, and people we are designing for. It’s important to have a clear understanding as to how you group the users into a particular bucket, ie, how you segment them into focus users groups. To be able to do this, we need to have answers to questions such as, who would be using the product and to what extent, everyday professional challenges faced by users? Keeping the needs in mind, we have to strategize and implement customizable solutions as per the domain-specific requirements of the user groups.
Every B2B SaaS product caters to a solution to one focal problem. For example, HubSpot meets the marketing needs, Zoom meets the conferencing needs, Vymo meets the on-ground sales people’s needs. Every business is in existence because they have identified a gap and believe that their solution can make a difference. As designer’s we hold the primary responsibility of validating the business inferences with that of the pain points of target users; research should focus on behavioral patterns, tech-savviness, and most importantly the willingness to adopt the product. 61% of smartphone users will promptly log on to another website if the one they are on does not fulfill their needs.
Most often a management-based software is perceived as a measurement tool and not as a problem solver. Any CRM tool that exists today has an extremely poor adoption rate because it always takes a top-down approach instead of taking a bottom-up approach. This happens because none of these products have been able to incorporate the individual motivations of the users. When you define a proper value proposition for each of the user groups, this challenge is solved.
Once you have an understanding of the users and their pain points, it’s vital to translate each problem statement into a relevant product feature. And based on the user need chart and their journey of the product, designers need to prioritize features and create a blueprint of the app. As a product designer, it’s important to differentiate between the must-have functions versus the nice-to-have features. Most of the designers use card sorting techniques, user map flows to be able to come to a solution.
A vital part of understanding how B2B users interact with SaaS products is through studying the buying process. The Eisenberg Customer modality studies buyer behavior and analyses their purchase patterns to understand what motivates them to buy what they buy. Data suggests that since the B2B SaaS customer is making a purchase decision on behalf of the company, they are likely to take a slow and method-oriented approach instead of making a hasty decision. Their buying process involves reviewing the technical data on the application and considering alternatives for the same product. Purchase statistics state that most buyers feel more familiar with a brand after consuming some content from it, both in the form of a blog post or a video; 73% of consumers are more likely to buy a product or service after seeing a relevant video on the offerings.
User Testing in B2B SaaS startups is vital in order to reduce the incidence of errors since organizations are less forgiving of errors as compared to individual users. Here are some ways:
1. Limited Release:
Many B2B SaaS startups experiment with a limited release of an app whereby they release a minimum viable product (MVP) of the application to the first set of users. This proves to be an efficient method of gauging user response for a product because we can review which features are relevant/critical for the end-users and which are passable. A limited release also helps ascertain the reception of the application in terms of device optimization. Mobile users are five times more likely to abandon a purchase or cancel a subscription if a website isn’t optimized for mobile as compared to traditional web users.
2. A/B Testing:
Since B2B SaaS startups are targeted at large organization which services many people across different job roles and responsibilities, it might be a good idea to iterate with different versions of the application for different user groups. This method is also known as split testing since it enables users to capture different reactions to the two versions and pick the ones that garner the more positive response.
Increase in Sales and User Adoption
The most intuitive benefit is an increase in user adoption thereby increasing overall sales. A bug-free application that is equipped with all the desired features and a favorable experience will surpass user experiences and generate positive reviews leading to higher adoption numbers and repeated subscriptions. A ten percent improvement in user experience can translate into a billion dollars in additional revenue.
Increase in User productivity
The purpose of any B2B SaaS product is to ease the internal functioning of the organization and help the employees get things done efficiently. If the application removes manual bottlenecks to work and increases the operational efficiency of the organization, it will generate an overall increase in productivity and drive higher rates of adoption in the future. User adoption point in the direction of an unforgiving mobile-first generation; over 90% of users stop using an application after having a bad experience, while 86% are likely to uninstall one such application altogether.
Decreased User errors
User errors in an application represent an inherent cost to the company. This happens because errors indicate a longer time requirement as far as the task completion is concerned at the very least; in some cases, this leads to duplication of labor. Efficient B2B SaaS startups must be proactive in identifying user errors and removing them.
Decreased Training Costs
When an app is designed keeping user preferences and patterns of behavior in mind, the resulting product is built to suit. This paves the way for instinctual user experience and reduces training costs for the employer.
Early iterations in the design cycle leading to savings
Every feature that is added to an application requires the allocation of both resources and funds for development. If the MVP of the application is pivoted smartly to suit the needs of the end-user, a large portion of unnecessary development costs can be capped at an early stage.
Decreased User Support
A smooth-functioning B2B SaaS application will require less support from the team post-deployment saving valuable time and resources for the startup.
Building a B2B SaaS startup can be a daunting process because involves many levels of meticulous planning and execution for people in organizations with different roles and responsibilities.

I’ve learned to love the sweet sound of screenshots being taken on my Macbook.
This is a little hack that I’ve discovered for tracking any interesting ideas I stumble upon online, or just to make sure that I don’t forget a discussion I had on Slack. Every once in a while, I sift through these screenshots for ideas that still seem relevant and exciting.
While my collection of cool growth hacking ideas has become quite impressive over the years, here’s a fun fact: we at Ahrefs never implemented the overwhelming majority of them.
Don’t get me wrong; I do like these hacks a lot. It’s just that we’re unlikely to try them ourselves — and I’ll explain why later on.
Let’s start with these 9 great hacks:
This one’s pretty famous. It was used by Dropbox to permanently increase their signups by 60 percent and was responsible for kickstarting their growth.
Here’s how it worked: anyone who signed up to Dropbox could refer a friend in exchange for more free storage space. Of course, users were eager to become referrers and hook their friends up.
Referees were offered a similar incentive. If they signed up using their friend’s referral link, they also received extra storage space.
A win-win situation in both cases.
Plus it’s easy to tweak to your own needs: you could grant a trial extension or a discount, so on and so forth.
Thinking about trying this trick out or yourself? This article by Andrus Purde is a good read on the importance of timing as a factor when designing your referral program.
Intercom’s gotten pretty famous for this hack recently.
It’s rather self-explanatory: when you use Intercom’s free plan, your chatbox will include a mandatory “Powered by Intercom” message.
Which means that you and your brand are now effectively billboards for Intercom, of course. Smart, isn’t it?
Back in the day, Hotmail used an even stronger variation of this hack with their automatic email signature: “PS: I Love You. Get Your Free Email at Hotmail.” When people sent emails to their friends, their friends were seeing this message and signing up. (Here’s the full story — it’s really interesting.)
Here’s one more instantly recognizable execution of this hack: Apple’s “Sent from my iPhone” signoff. Don’t tell me you’ve never regretted not joining the “Apple cult” after someone sent you one of these!
Oh, and if these “signoffs” don’t work for your specific product, there’s another way to do it.
Let’s look at Workflowy — a software that basically allows you to make highly organized documents.
What Workflowy does is allow you to share public access to your documents.
Of course, once you send your link to your friends/colleagues/co-workers, they’ll want to sign up for Workflowy too when they see how awesome it is.
And I actually know this works!
So keep this in mind: when it comes down to it, the “powered by” hack is all about sharing public access to a great tool and letting people sign up on their own.
This is another pretty well-known concept for SaaS/startup communities.
The CCA hack entails identifying what makes users stay — and then pushing all newly registered users towards these activities.
The idea is to find, then trigger, specific behaviors that have already been proven to convert and keep customers. It’s a fantastic way to improve retention and reduce churn.
Here’s how Chargebee does it:
The other famous example I can quote is Twitter: they figured out that all they needed to do was get their users to follow 10 other people.
As you know, the rest is history.
Want some tips and tricks for the CCA hack? Here’s your further reading.
Getting people to stick with your SaaS is kind of a chicken-and-egg situation.
On one hand, you need to educate users and help them to get better at using your product in order for them to get lots of value from it and want to stay.
On the other hand, if they aren’t getting enough initial value, they might not stick around for long enough to learn how to use your product.
Enter gamification.
Games entertain, fulfill and motivate your users: when humans get a reward for something, we’re hard-wired to want more.
Motivate your users to stick around and learn about your product by rewarding their efforts.
Duolingo is a great example of an app that has managed to gamify the entire learning process for its 200m subscribers worldwide.
And they’re far from alone — these other SaaS companies have managed to succeed with this hack as well.
The essence of this hack is identifying the perfect time to ask people to sign up for an annual plan — then asking them to.
Most businesses only ask potential customers to “go annual” during the signup process itself, which is an absolutely terrible time to ask since the person hasn’t even tested your software yet.
Instead of doing this, run some analysis and figure out the point at which your users are discovering the real value of your product.
That’s the best time to nudge them towards signing up for annual billing.
On that note, this is a great read on why you should offer annual billing and how to best do it.
People cancel their accounts every day.
But lots of them don’t actually want to pull the plug entirely — they just want to “opt out” for a few months while they settle other things going on for them.
Why not give your users this option, rather than force them to cancel their subscription? This makes it a ton easier for them to come back and “resume”, rather than have to sign up all over again.
Hulu in particular has a great subscription cancellation flow — read more here.
Another tactic that Intercom is famous for: piggybacking, or riding on, your competitor’s brand awareness.
The strategy here is to target and rank for all the keywords your competitor “owns” and take advantage of the amount of exposure they have, whether it’s through SEO or PPC.
Plenty of SaaS companies do it these days: they bid for Adwords on their competitors’ names and create personalized landing pages explaining why their service is better than the competition’s.
Just look at these results for Help Scout:
That’s four competitors using this hack before you even get to the organic results!
The most famous example of the side project hack is Unsplash, which started out as a Tumblr blog and side project — but eventually raised $7.25 million and disrupted the photography industry.
Read the full story here.
To sum things up: build something on the side that provides value to people. This way, people who enjoy your side project will naturally be interested in your core business.
The trick is that this value must be related to your main business, or all the goodwill generated is less likely to transfer over.
It’ll be tough going, but it can actually be done.
You guessed it — this hack involves growing your customer base via integration with other, ideally bigger, companies. Here’s how you can do it.
Zapier is a unique example, since their entire business model is about integration with all sorts of software. Smaller SaaS companies like Referralcandy have also acquired lots of new users simply from enabling integration with Shopify.
Another interesting variation of this hack: acquisition.
The idea is to acquire a software with a large user base and migrate its user base over to your main product. (Interested in 2018’s top acquisitions in SaaS?)
I just discussed 9 growth hacks that were incredibly successful for other SaaS companies. Plus, I sincerely believe that we’d be able to find a way to implement them to great success.
So why didn’t we test them out at Ahrefs?
Well…the primary reason is that we lack the resources to execute most of these tactics well. Since we’re a pretty tiny team and we want to stay small and lean, we don’t have the leeway to do large-scale experiments most of the time.
Imagine dragging precious development and design resources away from creating new features to gamify our software, or asking our already stretched-thin marketers to create multiple landing pages for testing via the “piggybacking” hack.
Probably not a good idea.
As a small team, we need to prioritize the things that have the highest ROI for us.
So here’s what we did do instead.
These are the three “growth hacks” that we actually swear by, and which allowed our company to cross 40 million ARR with no funding (and less than 50 people in the entire team!)
I’ve talked about this before, and I talked about it again, and I’m still talking about it right now.
Having an amazing product is, by far and away, the most important thing.
Growth hacks may work, but when it comes down to it, they’re essentially “marketing gimmicks” that are built to manipulate people into staying as customers.
At Ahrefs, we’ve figured out that we get our best ROI by actually improving our core product.
This means listening to our customers, adding useful features or even removing those that our customers do not use.
Like I mentioned earlier, if people don’t know how to use your product and get value from it, they won’t stick around.
For this reason, we focus on creating tons of educational material — whether it’s on our blog, our YouTube channel, our Academy and so on.
Beyond that, we also have a private Facebook group to answer users’ questions and, of course, an amazing support team that can help 24/5.
SEO is our second most powerful customer acquisition channel by far (only beaten out by word of mouth.)
Whenever people do a Google search for anything related to SEO or something that Ahrefs can help them with, we try to be there — ranking at the top of the search results and collecting all that traffic.
This drives a lot of customers for us.
Note: not every startup can rely on SEO traffic since people need to be aware of an existing problem for SEO to work. If your startup solves a problem that people don’t know exists, you’ll need to rely on other methods to drive awareness.
Like word of mouth, for example. Which, of course, is undeniably driven by having a great product and a knowledgeable user base.
Anyway, there you have it!
We’d rather use our limited resources to double down on these three “core” tactics than spread our resources thin with a bunch of other growth hacks.
What about you?
Did you find these 9 growth hacks interesting?
Or would you choose to focus on the “fundamentals”, like us?

Originally published by Sean Sheppard on the GrowthX Blog.
The SaaS Learning Curve for most founders is longer than it needs to be. So long that it outpaces most early funding, leaving founders short of the traction milestones required for their next funding round.
Founders can avoid this outcome with one simple but powerful realization: It’s not your technology that wins, but the insights you generate by seeking fit within a market.
That’s worth Tweeting, don’t you think?
It’s not your technology that wins, but the insights you generate by seeking fit within a market. CLICK TO TWEET
That means you need to resist the temptation to focus on building a product and spend your time (and early funding) on working closely with early customers in solving a specific problem. A problem large enough to sustain you through the learning curve.
Here’s a trick to make this easy (please share):
Start thinking of SaaS as Service as a Software, not Software as a Service. CLICK TO TWEET
People don’t care about your products. They care about their problems. If you can solve their problems partially today via Service as a Software and more fully over time via Software as a Service then you will increase your chance of winning. This requires you to be high touch and low tech until you no longer have to be.
Servicing your customer accelerates your learning. Your best opportunity to learn and build what you want is by manually servicing your customer. It can take years to build a self-service product. So build a service-first culture and leverage that approach to build what your customers want.
The now-common refrain from the investment community about predictable, recurring licensing revenue puts pressure on founders which is not always correct. As such, it has convinced a generation of SaaS founders that they’re failing if they have to lean in with services while they are building a more whole and complete software.
This can create a whole host of unhealthy and misaligned behaviors that can result in a longer learning curve which in turn creates the potential need for more time and runway to learn and ultimately reduces win rates.
It’s true that humans don’t scale, but neither do startups that build interesting features without solving a market need. In the early days, you’re not ready for scale. A services mindset helps you find fit with a market need (and, ultimately, something worth scaling).
A Service as a Software approach helps you develop deeper insights into the problems you’re solving and build a more robust and stickier software solution for your market. Far from worrying, SaaS founders should rejoice when their early customers are asking for service! Where they should worry is if the market doesn’t respond. Silence speaks louder than words!!
Service as a Software is more than an important mindset to help founders focus on problems over features. In some circumstances, services-first can help a SaaS startup beat the competition. Tom Tunguz penned a great blog on this topic. Finish reading this article and then head over to his site to learn why in early markets, services can be a competitive advantage.
Service as a Software does not mean stop selling your vision. It means stop selling your product to customers (as if it’s complete). Instead, recruit early partners who share your vision and are willing to implement your reality. And your reality as an early-stage startup is that most of what you’ve built is riddled with “happy accidents.”
A startup is a series of experiments. You need to constantly ask yourself WWBRD (What Would Bob Ross Do). He would celebrate being less wrong tomorrow than he is today! Be like Bob; be a learn-it-all (not a know-it-all).
So how do you identify and recruit early partners? I’m glad you asked
I’m often asked, “which customers do I go after first”? The framework for answering that question starts with asking the same question differently: “Which customers are open to sharing my vision while accepting my reality?”
The answer is in Geoffrey Moore’s must-read book, “Crossing the Chasm”. The cohorts most likely to share your vision with an appetite for accepting your reality are referred to as Innovators and Early Adopters. These groups of people are willing to take the risk associated with working with incomplete products to realize a shared vision.
Innovators represent about 10% of the market and will provide you with great product feedback but rarely have a budget. As such, they are quite useful in the pre-revenue stage of a Service as a Software company.
Early Adopters represent another 10–15% of the market and they have a budget. They often buy because they seek a competitive advantage. They see that being achieved by working with you to realize what should become a shared vision for your product.
Regardless of your customer, all commerce is human to human (until the bots take over). It is vital to recognize that humans rely on the humans building the product to solve their problems; they don’t rely on the product.
After all, when was the last time anyone sought recourse from a product when something goes wrong? Never! They seek recourse from those who convinced them to join them on a wayward journey. They expect service from you, not your product!
The next question I get is “how do I know where I am in the learning curve, or if I’m making progress?” To effectively commercial innovation you need to accept that learning precedes revenue. If you start the journey with a Service as a Software mindset and build a functional learning organization, you will accelerate your path through the SaaS Learning Curve.
This requires you to create an environment that supports rapid on-the-job learning by adopting a growth mindset, developing your business acumen, facilitating cross-functional communication, and embracing ambiguity.
Reserve the right to be better tomorrow than you are today based on what you’ve learned. CLICK TO TWEET
Learning powers your early journey as a Service as a Software founder. It helps you efficiently transition from a non-scalable (but critical) Service as a Software approach to a profitable, predictable and scalable Software as a Service business.

If you want to come to our next event in Munich, please reach out here.
In the last couple of months I spent more and more time in Munich for Point Nine. What I find most exciting about the ecosystem there:
While there are many meetups in Munich, especially from corporates, I realized that there are not many events that focus on knowledge sharing among founders. Since this is something we think is hugely valuable (e.g. our annual SaaS meetup), we thought it would be a good idea to do that in Munich. So we brought ca. 70 SaaS founders and a few friendly investors together for an afternoon talking about SaaS.
Christoph mainly talked about hiring, raising capital, forecasting and customer acquisition among others. Based on the feedback in the audience, many founders could especially relate to the slide about corporates that are discovering entrepreneurship, i.e. corporate incubators, corporate VCs, etc.
He will upload his slides in the next couple of weeks and I will add them to this post, but to give you a glimpse:
When listening to the questions and experiences founders shared, some of the biggest challenges are:
Norman and Oliver, who both sell to industrial companies, especially emphasized the big pain of legacy systems and the differences of the factory stack.
Heiko has many years of experience in sales and co-founded Riskmethods in 2013. They are hunting elephants and are now 120+ people, which includes a big sales team that Heiko is managing. I can highly recommend his presentation for anybody who is scaling sales, and wants to learn more about running deal clinics, how to build a sales academy and the difference of ABC vs. ABQ.
You can find his slides here.
Thanks everybody for joining, contributing and thanks to the whole Point Nine team for organizing. I’m in Munich frequently and happy to meet more founders and people from the ecosystem there in person, just reach out here.

Top highlight
I had spent 25 minutes showing a content team the many ways Airstory would improve their lives when their manager looked at me and said:
But you guys aren’t funded.
It was then — in that moment — that I realized this: I suck at demos.
I knew that to be an absolute fact because I had spent nearly 15 years as a copywriter before starting Airstory — I can tell a legit objection from a shit objection with my head underwater. Poor sales copy leaves the reader with BS objections like “it’s too expensive.” Poor demoing leaves the viewer with BS objections like “you’re not funded.”
My demo was so bad that the decision maker ended up telling himself (and me) this: self-funding a SaaS solution, with money in the bank, is a weakness.
Tail between my legs, I closed the Zoom meeting and hoped no one on my team had overheard.
That night, I added these books to my Kindle. I hungrily consumed them over the next couple of days, while traveling for conferences:
You should buy those 3 books. It’s a $25 investment for a ridiculous sales education. And they’re quick reads.
While those are syncing in your Kindle, you should read this and do these things, too — all of which I wish I’d known a year ago.
Quoi?! But it’s called a “demo.”
Yes, you will demonstrate your product’s features and benefits.
No, you will not think of it as demonstrating your product’s features and benefits. And the demonstrating may only take a fifth of the total “demo” time.
Like [almost] everything in business, the demo is an act of persuasion. It’s not about the features — it’s never, ever about the features, even when it is. Your natural inclinations to demonstrate features X, Y and Z can actually harm the sales cycle.
Contrary to popular opinion, the primary goal of a demo is not to demo your product! Let me say that again: the goal of the demo is not to demo your product. — Rob Gonzalez
So what is your goal when demonstrating SaaS? Like in copywriting and perhaps in all things marketing and sales, your goal in demonstrating is first to identify your prospect’s pain. From there, you further qualify if your product is a good fit to solve the pain.
Fully qualified?
Good — that’s where the demo begins. It could happen 15 minutes or more into your scheduled time.
But that doesn’t mean that, once you’ve identified their pain, you simply start showing off your tech. As Rob Gonzalez notes in this fantastic article, a demo isn’t a software tutorial — the only time your prospects will even see your software is when you’re showing them exactly how it crushes their pain. And that may not actually take more than a few clicks — a few minutes — inside your app.
Your demo is not about your product.
Your demo is a sales conversation. As Vengat Krishnaraj puts it:
Don’t waste time showing [prospects] the step-by-step process of doing something. Create a vision of what benefit they can get by using your product. Then demonstrate how they achieve that benefit. Only if they ask for more should you get into the “step-by-step” process of how to set things up.
The demo is the backdrop for the main event: the conversation. Greg Meyer explains in a Quora thread:
Great demos sound like engaged conversations between prospects and buyers where we arrive at a shared agreement to learn something new. If that solution is a good match to the buyer’s need (and indeed the art of the demo is helping the buyer to see how the solution meets their need), the buying part is simply negotiation.
So if you’re not much of a conversationalist, it’s time to get practicing — or perhaps it’s time to hire that “annoying guy” who’s always asking you questions about your ski trips and taking strangely keen interest in your life.
Turns out, it comes down to what it’s always come down to: people like to do business with people they like. Sure, your prospect may buy after seeing one key feature well-demonstrated. But you won’t even get to that demonstration if s/he doesn’t like you first.
People don’t buy features, they buy solutions, trust, and relationships. — Rob Gonzalez
Okay, so that’s the foundational stuff.
Now let’s say you get a meeting booked for a demo.
How do you actually run the demo?
Turns out the demo doesn’t begin when you hop on the call or show up at the office. There’s a whole world of advice on the “pre-demo.” Have you given much thought to the pre-demo?
You should do a little research before you talk with anyone in business.
But the demo pros know that the pre-demo phase is not to be taken lightly. A “little research” is just scratching the surface of what you’ll want to do before the demo call starts. Some people, like Rob Gonzalez, suggest that the pre-demo work is the most important part of the entire demo.
In a thread on Reddit, user StarkSell notes that you need to know three things before you can even consider running a demo:
To get this info, StarkSell suggests that, that day before the demo, you call the person who booked it and use this basic script for your pre-demo call:
Hi, I wanted to call to check I have everything straight for tomorrow’s demo, if that’s ok?
We’re meeting at X Location for X Amount of time, right?
You won’t be the final decision maker and she won’t be attending right?
OK awesome. So I can ensure we tailor the presentation for you, what are you hoping to get out of tomorrow’s demo to look back and say “that was a good use of my time”?
OK, so if I’m hearing you right, we achieve X and Y you’ll be happy with our time together?
What will happen after our time together?
What do you think are the most important points for her?
If everything goes well and she’s happy with your feedback, will there be an opportunity for us to meet with you and her together, to answer any questions that come up after?
Raj Nadar adds that you should not give a demo until you’ve had a call and prepared a deck:
The [pre-demo] call you gives you the ingredients you need most: Context and Priority.
Precede the product demo with a small 2–3 page deck. Ideally it would talk about the prospect’s company and the perceived problems, a page on a high-level describing how your software solves those problems, and third page building trust and confidence in you as a firm as well as your company, customer logos, a wee testimonial, founder creds won’t harm.
I personally had no idea you were supposed to hold a pre-demo call. Big revelation. (The script above helps!)
Once you know that you should do the demo, here’s what to do to nail your pre-demo work:
So good. You know your audience.
You know your talking points.
You’ve got your browser all set up and everyone properly invited.
Next: time to nail that demo. Yup, it’s time for your meeting.
(Bonus tip: Hit record as soon as you join the demo room, like your Zoom room.)
When the demo starts, you won’t launch into your software demo.
Some sales people, like Adrian Diaconescu, like to hold off on showing the product as long as possible. Here’s one key reason you want to delay the reveal:
The strategy was to spend time with the buyer, understand their objectives, buying criteria, buying process, qualify financially and agree on a solution.
You won’t show your software immediately — you may or may not share your screen, though. If you do share your screen, don’t have your app showing. Instead, consider sharing either:
As people join the meeting, you’ll want to start building rapport.
Yup, this means small talk.
Authentic — not weather-based — small-talk. As SalesLoft suggests:
Be sincere and ask them how their day has been. Reference an article you read about them. Do something that will make them remember you. In a competitive market where solutions are similar, it’s ultimately you that will be the tie-breaker.
You’re not just chit-chatting to build rapport, though. Director of Sales Jordan Rackie notes that you need to combat all the distractions your viewers could be facing, and a conversational approach to the demo can help with that:
When you’re doing a web demo, you want to get the client involved early because there’s so many things they could be doing while on their computer (checking email, browsing the web, etc). For the first 10 or 15 minutes, make sure they’re speaking for about 80 percent of the time. Ask a lot of questions up front, learning about their business, keeping them involved.
The keyword: questions.
Ask lots and lots of questions. Follow the 80/20 rule: 80% of the demo content should be about your customers, and 20% should be about your solution. Summarize past conversations. Ideally you’ll already know what your prospect is struggling with when you head into the demo, but this early part of the live demo is a good point at which to get greater clarity on their pain and remind everyone in attendance of the challenges their team faces.
Some questions you need to answer, courtesy of Alex Yamamoto:
As you ask questions and they answer, your prospects are bound to come up with questions of their own. This is a great opportunity, as Yamamoto explains:
Treat a demo like a discovery conversation and make sure you are constantly checking in to give your prospects time to speak and ask questions. When they ask a question, follow-up and dig deeper to get at the heart of their issues.
And here’s a cool bonus: the question-asking period of your demo is a great way to learn about your market in those early growth stages.
A direct line to uncovering the pain is this question, suggests Rob Gonzalez:
“Just so I make sure I focus the demo on what’s most important for you, why did you take this call? What are you hoping to see?”
Once you’ve identified their pain, stop pushing for more. Instead, try dimensionalizing that pain. Steli Efti explains how to do just that with this script:
Sales rep: “So, currently your company is losing out on sales opportunities because leads are falling through the cracks. You’ve got tasks and notes and reminders in your system for hundreds of leads, and it’s just a big mess right now. None of your reps are able to consistently complete all tasks on time and follow up as planned with every lead. That sounds like you’re losing out on a lot of potential deals, right?”
Prospect: “That’s right, that’s why we’re looking for a better system now.”
Sales rep: “I see. If you would just make a guess, how much revenue do you think you’re missing out on just because of ineffective lead management?”
Prospect: “Well, I haven’t really run the math yet, but I’d say roughly $2,000 to $3,000 in deals per rep each month.”
Sales rep: “Wow, and you’ve got 16 reps working for you currently?”
Prospect: “That’s right.”
Sales rep: “So we’re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost deals every year. Well, I’m now going to show you a feature that’ll make you hundreds of thousands of dollars over the next twelve months. Do you want to see this?”
You know what will excite them about your product — so you know what your “dinosaur feature” is. Let me explain.
Don’t save the good stuff to the end, as Steli Efti notes.
Start with the killer feature that most obviously addresses your prospect’s identified pain. Your first 2 minutes should wow them — and to do that, SurveyGizmo recommends you take a page from Jurassic Park:
Grant and Elle drive up to the meadow and there is a brachiosaurus. The look of awe on their faces is priceless.
Notice how Hammond doesn’t just take them into the lab right away and show them the genetic cloning process. He orchestrates this moment to shock their senses.
While a software demo rarely blows people away to the extent of this example, any sales person should be aiming to emulate that initial experience.
Only after they’ve seen the highly desirable outcome should you walk them through how to get there. This is especially important for winning over the key decision makers, who are less likely to care about what’s behind the curtain and more likely to be looking for end results.
From there, the goal should be to highlight what’s unique, says Brian de Haaff. ​​​Let your audience guide you through the details you should show, if and as they’re interested. As Sean Burke says:
Let them steer — one of the reasons that SaaS products have such a low usage rate is that users don’t take the time to understand how to use the product. If your product is intuitive(big if) — then hand over the control of the demo and let them use it with your guidance. Why? You want them to personalize their experience with using your product. If they find it easy to use and valuable, then you maybe able to skip the trial and go right to the proposal stage.
When you’re demoing the feature level, Steli Efti recommends you always go from macro to micro:
When you’re demoing a feature, always give your prospects the big picture first. They should never watch you demo something and not know what the purpose of it is. If a prospect wonders, “Why is this guy showing me this?”, then you haven’t properly explained first what it is you’re going to demonstrate.
Question-asking doesn’t stop once you’re demoing features. This is a great point to get feedback and buy-in from your prospects. Before you show a feature, try this formula:
You can also learn a lot about your prospect — while avoiding interrogating them — by asking them about their business as you demo. Rob Gonzalez gives this example:
“You can see here we have 3000-some widgets loaded into the system from some of our customers like XYZ. How many widgets do you have?”
And while you’re demoing only the features your prospect needs to see, based on what you know about them, remember this: slow down. Sebastien Bonnier explains that you may know your product inside and out, but this is the first your prospect is likely seeing of it — so go easy on flying all over the screen.
If you’ve reached the end of the pains they’ve identified but you have more to show them (because you know they’ll really wanna see), consider adding this to your demo script, courtesy of Hampus Jakobsson:
“Do you want me to show something else — I can take you through a general product tour if you want, it just takes 5 minutes.”
If you’re unclear on the pain your prospect needs you to solve, start your demo with a real world use case, says Alain Mevellec. Jason Lemkin fleshes out that thought:
The best way is to demo using actual data/instance/etc. if permitted — how a real paying customer is using the service. Connect that to a great story about the customer and the real ROI.
The You-They-You Framework is highly recommended by Robert Falcone, author of Just F*ing Demo!
“You need to show your prospects only the specific features that they need to achieve what they want, so that you can get the result you’re aiming for. The success of a demo depends on your prospect’s understanding the value you could add.” (source)
Brooke Harper recommends the WIN approach:
W — rite a personalized demo
I — nitiate a discussion
N — ever stop practicing
Also consider EQCRC: Encourage Question Confirm Respond Check. Rob Gonzalez uses it to develop empathy with a prospect. Here’s the script he uses to explain it:
Prospect: “Getting started seems like a lot of work.”
Me (Encourage & Question): “Yeah, I can totally understand that reaction. It does take some effort to get started depending on how many widgets you’ll be loading. About how many widgets do you think you’ll be maintaining?”
Prospect: “Maybe about 40.”
Me (Confirm & Respond & Check): “Yeah; 40 can definitely seem overwhelming. But the good news is that it’s a one-time effort that our Customer Success team really helps you out with at the beginning. We have customers with well over 100, and the started getting lots of value after the initial handful to their key retailers were set up. That make sense?”
Raj Nadar recommends finishing a demo with this question:
On a scale of 1–10 how much have we covered of what you wanted to cover?
If you don’t get a ten, ask what else they were hoping to see. Continue the demo.
Then, in the final five or so minutes, talk about next steps.
Do you want to execute the contract? Ask for it.
If you have a slide deck prepared to help you through your demo, the final slide could begin your closing sequence, suggests HubSpot.
Although there are different schools of thought on the ultimate goal of a demo, it’s a sales tool — so unless the sales cycle continues beyond the demo and there are more stakeholders to involve, go for the sale. As Annie Musgrove puts it:
Don’t just thank the prospect for their time. Go all the way to the sale. That’s the ultimate goal, after all. And if the sale doesn’t go through, there are still other tiered goals you can aim for. If not a sale, then a trial sign-up. If the customer doesn’t even want a trial of your product, then you should leave the conversation with precise feedback on why not. This could be invaluable insight into the product and also the sales demo itself.
Don’t hesitate to push for the close. Be clear on what is the next step and get your prospect to commit to it.
Also feel free to ask the prospects what they believe the next steps are.
After everyone exits the demo, it’s time to follow up. Stat.
If you haven’t already, immediately connect with all parties on LinkedIn.
Here are some top tips for an awesome post-demo email, courtesy of SurveyGizmo and InsightSquared. Make sure this is in your email:
If the person you demoed to has to sell their boss on your solution, your job is to help make that conversation very, very easy — and persuasive. Consider sending them a competitive analysis, says InsightSquared, featuring a clear comparison of your pricing vs theirs and your features vs theirs. Don’t forget to bolster its persuasiveness with testimonials, case studies and influential logos.
UPDATE: If you’re using Airstory (or considering trying it), grab this Airstory template to get a pre-written email you can send post-demo
At Airstory, we use Acuity Scheduling to help teams book their demos with us online. And we use Zoom to run the demos because it doesn’t need to be installed, it has great screensharing, it has great recording — and everyone can see each other’s smiling faces.
Here’s what the pros recommend for demo software:
Because not everything fits nicely into the flow above.
Are you better prepared to start demoing now? Have I missed anything worth noting? I’d love to hear it — it could be the difference between a killer demo and another “we’ll use you when you’re funded” comment.

PS: I researched this post in 4 hrs using the Airstory Researcher. The result was 79 cards and nearly 7000 words, which I organized in an outline in 8 mins inside Airstory. Then I switched from Outline to Document to write. If you don’t factor in dinner or spin class, which I certainly don’t, I took 4.5 hrs to turn my cards into this blog post in Airstory. Then I pasted into Medium. All told, that’s less than 9 hrs to write a 4277-word post. Try Airstory for your work writing

Top highlight
In SaaS years, I’m an old, old dog.
Freckle turns 10 years old this year.
Charm, well, we built it and ran it for a while then shut it down.
Sweep — our third SaaS product — has just launched to the public.
I’ve done a lot of front-line support. And I’ve managed several minor crises (and the shuttering of a much-loved service). I’ve handled price changes and interface overhauls. And… I’ve used a lot of SaaSes that dealt with even bigger problems, most of them badly.
Customer loyalty — which always requires customer forgiveness — is a paradox.
On the one hand, customers will forgive a lot more than you think they will…
BUT! Only if you handle it right. Otherwise, they’ll tolerate a lot less than you think they will.
So, drawing from my decade-plus of experience, keen observation, and study of the human animal, here are…
You may think your app is the product, but no… customer data is the product, and I’m not talking about selling demographic data. Customer data is the product in the customer’s eyes. Your SaaS is a cracker in a world of tasty dips: just a delivery mechanism.
Your customer doesn’t use your app because it’s so amazing, they use your app to produce or do something.
So when you lose that something… you’ve lost everything, from their perspective.
There’s no nice way to say “We lost your data.”
You can be as genuinely contrite and empathetic and helpful as you please and it won’t make it better. It won’t restore their trust. The only thing that can lessen the impact of data loss or data leak is if the data wasn’t very important or private, or if it wasn’t very much data.
If you lost an hour of customer data to a database error, you will probably be able to seek forgiveness from most customers, as long as you communicate well, and it doesn’t happen again.
Which brings us to……
As it turns out, business isn’t made out of Perfect Products plus The Economy™.
Business is made out of people. People are made out of relationships. And relationships are made out of communication.
There’s a reason that the two big forms of shitty communication rest at #3 and #6 on this list of deadly no-no’s. Your SaaS is just one bad rom-com plot twist away from customers hating you.
Here’s the good news:
But, if you’ve ever used any other SaaS ever, you’ve experienced the opposite. You’ve written support with a bug that totally messed up your day, and got a canned response in return. Or you’ve rolled into work one day, checked your email, and received a single damned day of notice that prices were going up, like, tomorrow.
Congrats! You’ve experienced how sociopathic communication can destroy good will over an event that is otherwise quite forgivable.
I call this extremely common communication style sociopathic because it fails to respect customers as human beings, by…
Here’s the problem: Sociopathic communication is our default.
It’s dangerously easy to fall into communicating like a sociopath even when you have a full complement of human feeling, because that’s the sort of communication you experience every day. You know, like “We do apologize for any inconvenience.” Gross!!
So don’t forget to put the Service in Software as a Service.
Here are the three things in life that people have the most ~fEeLiNgS~ about: romance, religion, and revenue, by which I mean “money” but that doesn’t start with an ‘r.’
Ah, I hear you saying, but my SaaS is B2B. We all know B2B buyers aren’t very price sensitive at all! Sure, they buy on value and it’s not even their money, usually, so they’ll happily pay far more than a consumer ever will. It’s all true… but only up to a point.
If your customer feels tricked, no amount of distance from the purse will shield you.
And tricked is just how they’ll feel if you surprise!! raise prices. It has happened to us more than once, where a SaaS we’d been using for ages sent just one, single email about a 100% to 200% increase with just a few days’ warning and no recourse.
Imagine the frustration and anger of B2B buyers who then had to explain that increase to their bosses. Doubling or tripling is a lot. Especially out of nowhere.
Rule: Never make your buyer look bad to their boss.
Poorly thought-out price increases are actually much worse than accidental overcharging because it’s a willful act and violates the trust in the relationship. Raising your price isn’t bad. Doing it badly is bad. I wrote an entire series on how to raise prices the right way.
As for billing errors: Mistakes happen. As long as you’re upfront, honest, apologetic, and most importantly, quick to fix the problem, it will be forgiven and forgotten by most. The ideal scenario is no error; the second-most ideal scenario is where you discover the billing error and proatively email the customer before they ever notice, saying “Hey, we found this, and it’s already fixed, refund is already on its way, so sorry!”
Note: If you ever undercharge a customer due to a billing error, kiss that money goodbye. Unless you are ready to kiss that customer goodbye. That’s the cost of doing business.
If I were making a list of the most-feared-by-their-creators SaaS problems, bugs and downtime would be pretty close to the top.
Customers understand that bugs — and downtime! — happen.
As long as it’s not too frequent. And the bugs aren’t too bad. And you don’t lose data.
Research has shown that product owners who experience an issue but have that issue resolved quickly & well actually trust the company more than those who have never have a problem.
So, communicate often and listen well. And (duh!) fix the problems and do your very best to undo any damage done.
And if you can collect bugs from system errors and ditch generic errors for a message that says “We’ve received this automatic bug report and we’re looking into it”? So much the better!
You know that joke in Airplane! where the pilot admits he has a “drinking problem”? We’re dealing with the same principle down here at the bottom of our most-hated list.
“Users hate design changes!” tosses completely new interface over the shoulder
The popular (and incredibly wrong) conclusion goes something like this:
This is so, so wrong. Ethically, professionally, and factually wrong. If you act on it, you’re a jerk; if it scares you off from ever redesigning anything, you’re also a victim.
You can dramatically improve your app’s UI without revolt.
The key here is that you must actually improve it. And you can’t improve a UI without factoring in what your customer needs and wants. And they don’t just need pixels and forms and calls to action.
Customers are humans, and humans need — wait for it — communication.
Here’s the recipe for success:
And never take months and months to implement a “whole app redesign” — and especially NEVER drop one on your customer’s head all at once.
It’s a simple rulebook, and it’s one I’ve followed to great success: There came a time when we needed to dramatically redesign Freckle’s navigation. It had been on the right (bad design), and there was no way to expand it to add quicker access to the features our customers used most (ineffective design). And new customers were struggling with the “floating” interface elements that I had once thought were so innovative. (Yikes.)
So, after much deliberation, I flipped the navigation from right to left, added more navigation elements to surface powerful features and reduce click-depth, embedded formerly floating elements into the new “frame,” streamlined a few extremely overly fancy and hard-to-read buttons, and added a neutral color for the new sidebar.
We did not change the core forms and interactions that make up the Freckle experience.
Guess what: It worked! From thousands of active users, we received only a handful of slightly cranky emails, mostly about the addition of grey to the cheerful color palette.
So remember: If you can’t explain how your interface change is an improvement, it probably isn’t.
Further reading: Users don’t hate change, they hate you by Christina Wodtke.
I have no doubt that you’ve spotted my semi-secretive agenda by now:
Poor communication is the silent killer of SaaS happiness.
And it’s true, too. And the flip side? Also true:
Learn to communicate well and humanely, and you will have deliriously happy customers.
Or, perhaps, customers who find their experience with your product so seamless that they take you for granted as an integral part of their working life (and treat paying you as a codified ritual they will always perform) and who never, ever show up in your inbox with pitchforks.
Which could be the best outcome of all.
Note: Throughout this essay, I liberally say “hate YOU.” But of course, it’s wildly unlikely that customers will come to hate you personally… unless you do something personally that is so offensive and sociopathic and uncaring to warrant it. (Hey, Zuck!) Don’t lose sleep about losing customers while you grow and improve. Churn is a fact of life. As long as you are both considerate and striving to improve and fix what is broken, your former customers will move on and find something that better suits them now, and you will attract new customers in the future. Buyer-seller relationships are just business, after all.

As the SaaS industry is reaching maturity, the app store model is becoming increasingly important. The past couple of years more and more software champions have launched their own SaaS app store (Salesforce, Zendesk, Hubspot…) where their customers can directly consume third-party SaaS. I believe this is an important trend to follow for SaaS founders as they have to adapt their overall strategy (from go-to-market to product decisions) to this “app store dominated” era.
In this post, you’ll find a spreadsheet listing 50 SaaS marketplaces as well as four observations I made while exploring them. Don’t hesitate to add in the comment section the platforms I have missed!
My definition of a B2B software app store is when a SaaS product enables its users to connect external third-party applications to enrich the core experience. The basic unit of an app store is the directory of third-party apps that the users have access to. But many features can be added: user reviews, user ratings, app recommendation, payment integration, co-marketing opportunities, deep product integration, developer portal, etc.
As a consequence, the SaaS app store model comes in many flavors: from very basic ones which are only “app directories” (just a list of connectors) all the way to very sophisticated platforms, like Salesforce’s AppExchange, which offers a ton of features for users to find and integrate the relevant applications, and require strict procedures for a third-party app to be listed (e.g a security audit).
A major trend that I’ve been following the past couple of years is the emergence of B2B software app stores in more and more categories. It started with Salesforce in the sales category, followed by Hubspot for Marketing, Zendesk for customer support, Intuit or Xero for finance, Zuora for payment, Slack for internal communication to the more recent ones like Invision’s app store for design or Intercom for customer communication.
When you look at the SaaS landscape, the trend is clear: an increasing number of software marketplaces emerge to cover the whole spectrum. And I don’t think it will stop. If there’s not an app store in a category, just look at the biggest player and wait that it launches its platform.
As I mentioned above, an increasing number of app stores are emerging, and obviously, they don’t all have the same level of maturity. They generally start as basic app directories to slowly evolve to more sophisticated platforms like AppExchange.
For SaaS founders, this disparity means different types of opportunities. For example, Intercom launched its software marketplace last year. As a consequence, the “audience” might not be huge yet, but the platform is not crowded, so the first apps benefit from a better exposure. On the other end of the spectrum, if you launch an app on AppExchange, it will be much harder to break through the noise, but if you manage to succeed the revenue potential is much higher. There are definitely opportunities to leverage up and coming platforms.
When I listed the major SaaS app stores, I noticed that most of the successful ones are targeting the SMB and mid-market segments. Of course, the enterprise segment also has its marketplaces (like Salesforce), but the model seems to make more sense for SMB and mid-market customers at the moment.
Which makes sense because one of the goals of such software marketplaces is to enable customers to pick and integrate quickly an external application. Enterprise customers need longer decision and sales cycles as well as stronger integration.

Successful SaaS businesses are driven by three things: customer acquisition, customer retention, and monetization.
If we know that’s the case, why do so many companies focus so much on customer acquisition, and spend significantly less on retention and growth? Growth without retention is not growth.
The business model is flawed for the reality of SaaS today. It’s time to usher in a new era of product, sales, and marketing strategy. Go-to-market strategy is still relevant, but without a go-to-customer strategy you will not succeed.
The SaaS world has left it’s awkward teen years. SaaS 1.0 was cost effective service delivery, replacing on-premise apps. SaaS 2.0 was about interoperability with existing solutions, while still delivering high value at low cost. As SaaS has largely become the defacto delivery model, and every organization worth anything takes an API-driven approach, what’s next for SaaS?
Business model evolution. Product, sales, and marketing changes will be abundant in this era.
Jason Green, Founder and general partner at Emergence Capital Partners, writes:
“Today, with the ability for end users to easily search, try and buy applications independently, the amount spent on the front of the sales process has been reduced dramatically. Sales now plays less of a role convincing end users and more of a role in satisfying IT on security, compliance and administrative control and in supporting early customer success and adoption.
In this new product-driven era, finding ways to simplify the value proposition and enable customers to get up and running quickly and easily and reducing any friction involved in the purchase is critical.”
So how does a SaaS company drive growth in this new era?
Product-driven experiences throw out the old marketing-qualified lead (MQL) model, and usher in product-qualified leads (PQLs). The rub? The freemium experience has to be awesome. Sales does not touch these people until they’re actively using the product for free. The product has to do all the work: show business value to and qualify the leads.
The re-calibration of the sales and marketing model is a natural extension in the product-driven world. Atlassian went from $0 to $100M without sales people. Sales teams should be kept lean in early days, and utilized for larger deals with longer sales cycles that involve getting buy-in from multiple stakeholders. How competitive your market is also affects the timing of hiring a sales rep.
As the marketing model moves to optimize for PQLs, we’re seeing the rise of the growth marketer. Growth Marketers don’t just care about prospects, they care about following prospects straight through the funnel to renewal. When building the Top of the Funnel (TOFU) they need to have a killer content strategy that flanks the product experience with helpful, credible content. As the prospect comes into the free program, they are driving and measuring conversion to paid. They are then focused on driving product usage, cross-sell/upsell, and hitting retention & customer growth targets.
They are 100% data-driven on metrics for the TOFU → PQL → Customer → Renewal → Customer Growth.
That’s the ideal, but we’re not quite there, and growth marketers need a framework for how to better focus on customers, because relationship marketing is here to stay. Growing through customers is lower cost and higher impact.
Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy is still important, but it’s missing customers. It’s about new customer acquisition. Whether that’s momentum-selling by industry, targeting a net new roles, geographic expanstion, etc.; It’s about acquiring net new customers.
PS. We’re actively researching the state of go-to-customer strategy if you want to participate in the survey.
It’s a focused product, marketing, and sales strategy that drives product usage, measures satisfaction, ensures renewals, and growth from within the customer base. It’s a net new approach to being highly relevant with every customer at every point in time, and scaling customer intimacy. It puts the relationship first, removes the ability to have irrelevant conversations, and removes the ability to build bad products.
Check out the full deck on SlideShare for a much more thorough explanation, along with recommendations for the team, framework, and how to measure success.
This is new and exciting territory for SaaS companies, and we’d love your help shaping the future of the go-to-customer strategy. Take this quick survey.

When you are just starting your SaaS startup, it’s tough to get the first customers on board. They are usually the ones who believe in you and your product from the very beginning. And if you manage to satisfy them, they will be your main ambassadors in the long run.
But how can you find those early customers for your SaaS? What are the ways to acquire them…

https://medium.com/startup-grind/saas-customers-aren-t-lazy-they-re-busy-de229ade32be?source=search_post---------205,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
An astute customer success agent recently asked me why I wanted them to make good on their 30-day money back guarantee. The answer I gave included the words: “I’ve come to peace with the fact that I’m lazy.” As in, I can’t be bothered to run through ten tutorials to get your product up and working. I was making a joke out of it, but the fact is, I told a boldfaced lie. I’m not lazy. I’m busy. And devoting 10 to 20 hours to learn how to do this thing that another software can deliver on a silver platter doesn’t make sense in the context of my life.
Your prospects and customers aren’t lazy.
They’re busy.
When you let that paradigm shift shine down through the ranks of everyone in your company, you will see lasting, positive results in terms of retention and lifetime value.
So let’s dig into this idea a little deeper, because paradigm shifts don’t happen in a paragraph.
“Often when we say customers are lazy, we’re really saying ‘our product is hard to use but that’s the customer’s fault,’ or something similar.” — Lincoln Murphy
If the feedback you get from your customer success agents, sales reps, and customer service department includes the word “lazy” — treat it as a red flag. Find out exactly where customers “get lazy,” because that’s likely where your user experience (UX) is failing. How kind of those busy customers to let you know!
Sounds fairly straightforward, right? But this runs counter to most of the advice for SaaS startups on the web. Typically, that advice sounds more like this:
“Most customers sign up, and then get too lazy to use your product or service. Offer them a 30-day money back guarantee if they give you another shot. Show them how to use your product the proper way.” — Rishi Shah, Digioh
Whoa there! You just let your product development team off the hook when, very possibly, they should be looking at your onboarding process and UX more closely for ways to make the product more intuitive. Or, perhaps, you could offer a live chat feature that pops up for new customers, right at the point where you’ve noticed they tend to get confused (because you track these things, right?).
Where and when do new customers typically fall off? For most SaaS companies, churn happens after just one or two uses, which means the customer isn’t finding what they need, or they’re not finding what they need fast enough.
I don’t know about you, but my life is too short, and I am doing too much, to take hours out of my week to learn to use a new product.
Some might say this is because I’m a Millennial. As a member of the largest generation, the generation that is swiftly taking over the workforce and is increasingly responsible for the tides of the global economy (for better or worse), I have a “digital native’s” expectations for technology products. When I get frustrated with a product, I have the same reaction as this Millennial quoted in a recent Nielson Norman Group article:
“When one Millennial user was intimidated by the tech specs on a computer website, he said, ‘I want to go to the store or chat online. I want someone to explain this to me better.’”
The article continues with another salient point:
“We frequently see Millennial users getting stumped in usability testing when they encounter difficult user interfaces. Their interactions tend to be fast-paced. Because they spend less time on any given page, Millennials are more likely to make errors, and they read even less than the average user (which is already very little).”
Okay, okay, so we don’t read the instruction manual most of the time (do you? Does anyone?). Google and Apple’s slick interfaces spoiled us early-on, and studies have shown that Millennials expect that same level of simplicity from all interfaces — even the interfaces of programs that offer complex, high-powered features.
“When interfaces fail to live up to those unrealistic standards of simplicity, Millennials rarely blame themselves — unlike older users. Millennials are quick to criticize the interface, its organization, or its designers.”
When your product has so much to offer, it can be a tough pill to swallow when a customer won’t spend the time to learn how to use it. And maybe your target customer is a software engineer who will read the manual and revel in your tutorials. But, for most SaaS businesses, your users are busy — which makes your challenge this: What steps can you take to make using your product faster and easier so they can achieve the end results they want? Start with quick wins.
I’m available for a limited number of SaaS consulting retainers, writing engagements, and I offer Twitter curation + growth (500–1,000 or more followers / mo.) with an authentic approach so that your feed doesn’t look like everyone else’s.

Karena dangkalnya pemahaman sesungguhnya soal teknologi komputasi di awan, atau yang lazim dikenal sebagai Cloud Computing, banyak pengamat dan pengguna teknologi yang malah terjerumus ke beragam kesalahpahaman tentang pemakaian Cloud. Mana yang lebih murah? Apa yang lebih aman? Harus pakai cloud yang mana? Dan rentetan kepeningan lainnya.
Hampir 99% kejadian, kalau ada tim/organisasi/perusahaan yang mengklaim telah “hijrah ke cloud”, yang dimaksud adalah sudah menggunakan Infrastructure-as-a-Service, disingkat IaaS. Namun demikian, masih banyak dan luas lagi ranah pemanfaatan cloud, termasuk juga Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) dan Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Bagaimana kesamaan dan perbedaan ketiganya?
Yang jelas, karena terhimpun dalam keluarga “cloud”, ketiganya punya karakteristik yang sama: yakni menjadi cara untuk menghantarkan sebuah layanan (service) melalui Internet publik (yang dikonotasikan dengan “cloud”). Contohnya, dulu tatkala kita mesti menulis laporan, meramu lembar kerja, atau menyusun slide untuk presentasi, andalannya adalah Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint (dipaket sebagai Microsoft Office) yang diinstal di komputer masing-masing. Akan tetapi, di zaman now, sebagian besar dari kita lebih memilih untuk menuangkan kreatifitas kita melalui Google Docs/Sheets/Slides yang semuanya notabene diakses secara online melalui layanan Google. Bisa dikatakan Google Docs ini adalah manifestasi dari paket Office ala Cloud. Tidak perlu lagi memburu dan memasang aplikasi secara lokal.
Dalam konteks IaaS/PaaS/SaaS, kesamaannya adalah tidak adanya infrastruktur fisik yang mesti dikelola oleh kita sendiri. Lawannya adalah “on-premises”, ditandai dengan aplikasi yang jalan di server fisik, biasanya diletakkan di ruang khusus (server room) atau pusat data (data center), dan disambungkan ke Internet. Di jaman sebelum ada teknologi cloud, inilah yang harus kita kerjakan: beli CPU dan disk, pasang sistem operasi, koneksikan ke Internet, dan konfigurasi aplikasinya.
Pun dalam keseharian, ada pekerjaan untuk memantau server tersebut, baik untuk memastikan bahwa perangkat keras sehat wal afiat (tidak kepanasan, kabel masih tertancap baik, dll) sampai sistem operasinya juga terus lancar (terus dimutakhirkan, tidak kekurangan swap, dll). Bila terjadi masalah, dari RAM yang jahil atau hard disk yang jebol, mesti diluangkan juga waktu dan tenaga untuk membenahinya.
Apakah bedanya IaaS dengan PaaS ataupun SaaS? Paling mudah kita lihat ilustrasi analoginya, Pizza as a Service, buah karya Albert Barron yang bekerja untuk IBM.
Dalam proses perjalanan sepotong pizza, dari awal hingga masuk ke lahapan kita, maka “on-premises” dapat digambarkan sebagai kegiatan yang dikerjakan sendiri, dan benar-benar dari awal. Kita mesti membuat adonan dan menambahkan saos tomat, keju, serta topping lain yang dikehendaki. Terus kita harus panggang sendiri juga (perlu oven dan api). Baru akhirnya menghidangkannya (lagi-lagi sendiri), barangkali juga bersama air limun segar sebagai pelengkapnya.
Sementara itu, IaaS, bisa dilukiskan sebagai modifikasi besar-besaran dari mekanisme on-premises, yaitu dengan pizza mentah yang sudah disiapkan oleh sang vendor (atau yang bisa dibeli di swalayan, seringnya masih beku). Memang potongan pizza tersebut belum matang. Adalah masih menjadi kewajiban kita untuk memanggangnya (masih perlu oven dan api/gas) serta menghidangkannya (meja, minuman pelengkap). Akan tetapi, bisa dilihat di sini bahwa kerja kita sendiri sudah sangat berkurang karena keribetan mengolah adonan pizza sudah bukan tanggung jawab kita.
Bagaimana bila pizza lezat ini dihantarkan dengan model PaaS? Dalam kasus ini, artinya pizzanya sudah jadi, alias tinggal dimakan. Entah caranya bagaimana, bisa nelpon pizzeria lalu minta diantar, atau ala PhD (Pizza Hut Delivery), ataupun dengan GO-FOOD, Grab Food, dan sebangsanya. Kerjaan kita minim sekali, hanya tinggal menghidangkan pizza tersebut sesuai selera dan langsung melahapnya (dan bersih-bersih, begitu sudah kelar). Tidak ada kerepotan bikin adonan dari nol. Tidak perlu punya oven, microwave, kompor, ataupun alat masak lainnya.
Akan halnya dengan SaaS, ini diibaratkan dengan makan di luar. Tidak perlu ada pengantaran. Kita cukup pilih kedai makan favorit, pesan dari menunya (misalnya pizza tersebut, bersama minuman pelengkap), lalu nikmati sajiannya. Sebagai bonus, kadang juga ada live music, baik dalam bentuk pengamen jalanan ataupun musisi serius, sebagai penghidup suasana. Selesai makan? Bayar tunai atau gesek kartu. Beres dah!
Di sisi lain, ada juga kombinasi lain yang juga ajib, seperti misalnya hybrid cloud atau malah multicloud (kita akan ulas di lain kesempatan).
Jawabannya: tergantung situasi. Tidak bisa dipukul rata.
Contohnya begini. Kalau Anda ingin makan nasi goreng (kearifan lokal: beralih dari contoh pizza di atas), murah mana antara bikin sendiri di dapur atau beli dari tukang nasgor. Dilihat dari harga bahan-bahannya, jelas lebih menghemat kala masak sendiri dong. Tapi terkadang, masak sendiri tidak memungkinkan. Barangkali Anda tinggal di kamar kost tanpa dapur. Atau juga, belum punya keahlian memasak nasi, apalagi meracik bumbu maupun menggorengnya hingga sedap. Atau malah, sedang buru-buru sehingga tidak bakal sempat untuk masak sendiri. Karena berbagai alasannya ini mungkin Anda lebih memilih pesan nasgor dari tukang nasgor di depan jalan atau lewat pengantaran GO-FOOD/Grab Food.
Apalagi untuk Anda yang sibuk sekali dan senantiasa dikejar waktu. Waktu Anda mungkin jauh lebih berharga untuk difokuskan ke pekerjaan, bercengkrama dengan keluarga, ataupun kegiatan yang lain. Walaupun perlu merogoh saku untuk membeli nasgor, dari perhitungan TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), masih lebih menguntungkan.
Makanya, kalau memikirkan soal harga murah atau nggak, tidak melulu hanya masalah harga beli. Ada juga ongkos waktu, pemeliharaan, dan komponen lainnya. Perhatikan TCO itu tadi.
Di sisi lain, walaupun masak sendiri itu menghabiskan ongkos lebih murah, belum kita dengar ada pasangan pengantin yang menyiapkan sendiri seribu porsi makan untuk tamu kondangannya. Selain sibuk dengan persiapan tetek bengek, tentu ada faktor scaling yang menyebabkan kemustahilan pasangan pengantin tersebut memasak untuk ribuan tamu kehormatan (gimana, kebayang capeknya nggak?). Di sini, lagi-lagi ada peran catering, sejalan dengan konsep SaaS, sehingga si mempelai (atau panitia yang didelegasikan) cukup membayar vendor untuk meramu selusin rupa-rupa hidangan, bahkan lengkap dengan alat makan, pelayanan, urusan kebersihan, dll. Tidak perlu pusing. Lebih mahal daripada masak sendiri? Sudah pasti. Mau mengerjakan sendiri? Jangan harap.
Orang yang benci on-premises tapi punya kendaraan sendiri itu berarti nggak konsisten (lho kenapa nggak selalu pakai ojol dan taksi, transportasi-as-a-Service?). Sama juga, mereka yang 100% bermusuhan dengan SaaS tapi masih suka beli kopi/Indomie/nasgor juga nggak taat doktrinnya sendiri (harusnya senantiasa masak sendiri dong!).
Jadi kalau ada pihak yang secara absolut sangat benci on-premises atau ada kubu lain yang 100% bermusuhan dengan cloud, jangan didengar. Pendapat seperti itu amat berbahaya dan menjerumuskan.
Jawabannya pun serupa: tergantung situasi. Tidak bisa dipukul rata.
Contohnya begini. Anda bernasib mujur dan memperoleh uang selembar 20 ribu. Bakal disimpan di dompet saja atau langsung disetor ke bank? Sebagian besar dari kita akan menyimpan lembaran tersebut di dompet saja. Ribet amat kalau hanya uang segitu terus harus repot ke bank segala. Nggak worth it, cetus anak millennial.
Lain halnya, kalau tiba-tiba ada yang menyetorkan uang kepada Anda, 100 juta rupiah, tunai. Wuih, mana berani disembunyikan di ransel lama-lama (apalagi di saku atau di dompet atau di bawah bantal). Pastinya lekas kita bergerak mencari cara untuk menjebloskan rejeki nomplok ini ke rekening bank. Gercep dong. Itupun sambil was was, siapa tahu ada penyamun di siang bolong manakala kita lagi beranjak ke kantor cabang bank tersebut.
Menyimpan data di sistem on-premises atau IaaS memberikan beberapa kelebihan, dari kontrol akses fisiknya hingga kesempatan kita menggunakan berbagai macam teknologi keamanan (kriptografi, penyandian data dari hulu ke hilir, dan lain sebagainya). Tetapi tidak selalu mutlak seperti itu, karena semua pekerjaan ini perlu ditangani ahlinya. Salah menggunakan algoritma kriptografi bisa berakibat fatal. Tidak melakukan analisis pemodelan ancaman (threat modeling) dapat menghasilkan ilusi keamanan. Ada mekanisme key rotation? Lantas, adakah review secara berkala untuk memastikan kalau semua personil yang terlibat tidak mudah ditipu oleh kampanye phishing atau social engineering lainnya? Dan selusin detil-detil lain yang mesti diperhatikan.
Sementara itu, kalau kita delegasikan urusan keamanan tersebut ke tim Google/Amazon/Microsoft karena kita menggunakan IaaS/Paas/SaaS yang mereka tawarkan, ada sejumlah hal yang berkaitan dengan kriptografi yang tidak lagi bisa kita kerjakan sendiri. Walaupun semua provider di atas menawarkan fitur untuk enkripsi (misalnya via KMS, Key Management System), tidak selalu semuanya bisa dimutlakkan. Di sisi lain, kita hendak mendapatkan manfaat dari keseriusan tim mereka untuk mengurusi keamanan fisik (triple biometrics), backup via redundancy, threat modeling, review berkala, dan beragam pekerjaan SecOps lainnya.
Ini namanya trade-off. Menimbun 100 juta rupiah di bank itu berarti kita nggak akan selalu bisa pakai kapan saja. Tetapi gila dong kalau kita pikir mengamankan 100 juta rupiah itu gampang. Bank dijaga beberapa satpam. Ada brankas lapis baja juga di dalamnya. Di rumah kita sendiri? Kadang ikan asin aja raib digondol kucing tetangga tanpa ketahuan!
Makanya, kalau berkaitan dengan isu keamanan dan ada pihak yang secara absolut sangat benci on-premises atau ada kubu lain yang 100% bermusuhan dengan cloud, juga jangan didengar. Sama-sama berbahaya dan menjerumuskan.
Mau naik sepeda atau naik mobil? Nah, tergantung ke mana dong. Tidak masuk akal kalau kita pilih moda transportasinya dulu sebelum jelas arah tujuannya. Menggenjot sepeda untuk pulkam dari Jakarta ke Semarang akan menghasilkan kepenatan tiada tara. Menyetir mobil untuk ke Indomaret depan gang juga buang-buang bensin/emosi/waktu.
Mau pakai on-premises, IaaS, PaaS, atau Saas? Cermati dari apa yang mau dibangun. Jabarkan kebutuhan dan calon-calon solusinya, lalu hitung TCO (jangan cuman harga beli), dan tinggal tentukan mana yang cocok. Tidak ada satu pilihan yang cocok untuk semuanya. Jauhi fanatisme dan jangan main pukul rata. Solusi yang manjur untuk startup kecil yang baru punya ribuan user akan sangat beda dengan apa yang bakal dipilih oleh Unicorn dengan jutaan pemakai.
Yang jelas, ketika membahas tajuk cloud, selalu gunakan kesempatan tersebut untuk menguraikan dengan rinci. Jangan hanya sebut cloud, tapi arahkan ke IaaS, atau PaaS, atau SaaS. Dengan lebih detil seperti itu, segala macam kesalahpahaman dan kerancuan dapat dihindari dan diskusinya bisa mengalir lebih cerdas.
Nah, siapa yang mau tinggal di Negeri di Awan?
Nggak bisa move on dari open-source.

After attending SaaStr annual two weeks back , I returned to NYC with two big takeaways.
The first point is a trend that many of us have seen in the last year but with companies like Zenefits proving this model at scale I’m sure you will see more organizations start at this point. Giving marketing the ability to control the complete top of funnel just makes sense as we shift toward the fully quota’d marketing organization.
The Slack pricing model and payment terms, though, is something that turned many heads, including a brief look of shock from the host Jason Lemkin when Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield first explained.
The standard pricing set by Salesforce and many others years ago was the fixed, pay for seat model. You commit annually to a number of seats and are forced to make tradeoffs as to who should and shouldn’t be on the system. The Salesforce sales and customer success teams then try to grow and upsell. This is a multi-year process to get large adoption throughout a company that is extremely time, people, and resource heavy. This has been the recipe for the last 10+ years and it worked!
What’s the Slack fix?
Commit to seats but only pay for active users.
I commit to ten but only five people actually use…I pay for five.
Additionally, this leads to larger MRR much earlier in the client relationship which short circuits the upsell and penetration process by years.
Obviously I’m a fan and believe this will be a go to strategy for many companies in the (very) near future, especially for those brave enough to stop selling and trust the product to do the work. Time will tell if this blows up or becomes the norm, but either way it is refreshing to see someone pricing in a new innovative way.

A Star Wars post that we can’t can’t stop ourselves from not writing
From cereal boxes to chop sabers. Sleeping suits to themed fruits. The craze of Star Wars has crept into almost everything that you can (or can’t even) think of.
But honestly, we feel a little sad for leaving the SaaS world behind. So here’s the obligatory Star Wars post for SaaS businesses.
Yoda might have been the Jedi Master. But turns out he was also a SaaS superstar. His pearls of wisdom although could make grammar nazis cringe, were inspiring enough to bring out the knight in Luke.
If you’re running a SaaS business, here are a few pointers that you should borrow from the master mentor — Yoda.
Ah! A Yoda classic.
As a SaaS business, there are a lot of additional functions that you would have to take care of. Now you might have the best developers in your team who can build off all the tools over a weekend’s hack night. But is your developer working on the items that matter?
You simply can’t overlook customer success. Chuck all the 87 other metrics that you’re looking at. This is the only metric that matters.
SaaS pricing is all about transparent pricing and trust. And nothing breaks trust more than a sneaky upgrade in pricing, without proper communication. Although it might seem tempting to step towards the dark side, keep up your promise, grandfather your prices forever, and give customers sufficient notice.
This one’s pretty obvious. Experiment you must. From your welcome email, to your sign up flow, pricing and even your exit flow. There’s no fixed recipe.
It doesn’t matter if you have to take on the Salesforces or the Oracles of the world. If you have the right solution to solve your customer’s pain, you can carve your own niche. It’s not a Winner Takes All in SaaS.
Nobody said it better than Gail Goodman of Constant Contact in this blog “The Long Slow SaaS ramp of death”.
Thanks for reading this. End this post we must.

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-know-if-kubernetes-is-right-for-your-saas-315dfffe0a25?source=search_post---------53,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
Kubernetes is an awesome technology, and I personally have seen great gains in my ability to scale, deploy, and manage my own SaaS because of it. But, not everyone would immediately benefit from adopting it for a number of reasons:
If you are interested in Kubernetes but aren’t sure about investing the time/resources needed, this article is for you.
In order to understand what Kubernetes can do for you, you first need to know what benefits containers provide. Before spending time on Kubernetes you should first:
First and foremost, your application must be containerized. This means defining the steps needed to take a base OS image and install your application on it in a file (usually a Dockerfile).
Going through this process as well as defining environment variables needed to configure your application (such as the URL, username, and password of the database your app uses) will be critical to making your container image usable by Kubernetes.
Also make note of any dependencies your application needs to function and learn how to use the containerized versions of those.
Containers are designed to hold only the code needed to run an application. Any persistent data needs to be stored elsewhere, as the process of tearing down and spinning up containers (very common when dealing with containers) also destroys any data stored within the file system of that container.
Knowing how container storage is supposed to work and how to handle things like backing up data, moving that data between containers, and accessing the data from outside the container is very valuable when considering Kubernetes.
Kubernetes makes storage management easier with features such as auto-provisioning. This has the ability to have your storage provider (such as AWS EBS) create new volumes on the fly as new containers are created, automatically mounting them.
How you implement networking can play a large role in how you use Kubernetes. Knowing how to open specific systems to the public internet and hiding others, such as databases, while maintaining communication between services is important to understand for starters. Some more complicated operations which I’ve needed to learn were how to integrate load balancing as well as giving each customer’s instance a custom hostname (things which Kubernetes makes a lot easier).
If you are not using containers to deploy your application, you probably shouldn’t be using Kubernetes yet. The problems Kubernetes aims to solve are problems that arise when you try and scale a container-based infrastructure.
Here are a few of the problems I think Kubernetes is great at solving when trying to deal with containers at scale.
Kubernetes is basically a cluster of nodes which provide compute resources that can be consumed by container workloads. This clustered architecture allows for a very easy scale-up or scale-down of resources. You just add or a remove nodes from the cluster, and Kubernetes will automatically utilize those resources or reassign workloads on your existing resources.
This solved a major problem I faced, because I went from having a single server I had to keep scaling up (an annoying manual process) to having the ability to scale up or down my infrastructure with a single command using the CLI.
Another problem that Kubernetes solves is the ability to update all your containers. Before, I was writing shell scripts which would pick each relevant container and recreate it using a new image tag. The process would take over an hour, and I had no way of validating that the update was successful. With Kubernetes I was able to perform an update with a single command as in the example below:
Kubernetes also allows you to update any part of Kubernetes (networks, storage, etc.) with commands based on any criteria. This is a huge step up from writing your own scripts to enact changes to your infrastructure.
The last and one of the most important pieces of Kubernetes I’d like to talk about is the ability to self-heal. If Kubernetes detects something wrong with part of its infrastructure, such as a node not responding or a container not passing its health check, it will perform steps to recreate those parts of itself until things start working again.
This is extremely useful because if a piece of the cluster goes down for any reason, the workload will be reassigned and you can even have Kubernetes recreate entire servers to fix the problem.
When I migrated to Kubernetes, there weren’t that many changes I had to make because it was originally architected to be a multi-instance platform deployed via containers.
Here are some of the things I’ve learned while moving my own workload to Kubernetes.
When you create a new deployment, you have to wait for your app to start before it becomes available to the end-user. This becomes a problem if your deployment process involves creating new instances when an end-user presses a button or if you are performing updates on all your customers instances, as that requires a rebuild of the pods.
When moving to Kubernetes you may need to make some changes to your codebase to make the startup process more efficient so the end-user doesn’t have a degraded experience using your product.
A multi-tenant architecture means you have a single instance of your application which manages all your end-users in partitioned tenants, usually with a single database being shared between everyone.
If your application is not built to utilize clustering (multiple servers acting as a single instance) you should not be using Kubernetes yet.
Generally I see two types of architectures when working with Kubernetes:
I personally prefer multi-instance because they are much easier to implement compared to a clustered multi-tenant architecture. Also, the work involved in moving from multi-tenant to multi-instance isn’t too bad compared to adding cluster capabilities to a multi-instance architecture.
One of the great features of Kubernetes is the ability to scale up or down the number of pods in a deployment. But, if your application is not clustered or not stateless, this functionality is wasted since extra pods in a deployment wont be configured properly and can’t be utilized.
The process of utilizing statelessness in Kubernetes is often more trouble than it’s worth, since most times you will need to completely rework the way you handle configurations within your application.
Don’t be discouraged if you don’t want to spend the time to make your application stateless or clustered as there are many ways of adapting stateful deployments to use Kubernetes. But those have their own problems which I will not get into in this article.
After asking yourself these questions, you should have a pretty good idea if Kubernetes will be a good fit for you at this time. Most early stage startups are probably not going to need it, and more mature ones may have a lot of investment in other technologies so it wouldn’t be feasible to switch.
I think the best case for someone moving to Kubernetes is a startup looking to move from having a Minimum Viable cloud infrastructure that is using containers to power production workloads to something more stable. That was my case, and I can say I went from having periodic downtimes due to resource mismanagement and overworked servers to not having to worry at all about my infrastructure thanks to the power of Kubernetes.

Top highlight
Hi there, we’re Point Nine Capital a VC firm focused on SaaS and marketplaces. If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter.
In the last couple of days we’ve had lots of great conversations here in Pointnineland about the past, present, and future of SaaS. These discussions were triggered, among other things, by:
Our discussions prompted me to dig into Crunchbase for data on SaaS funding rounds in the last ten years. The data quality isn’t perfect (see the small print at the very bottom for some caveats) but it should be good enough for identifying the major trends in SaaS financing in the last years.
Let’s start with (a) the number of SaaS seed investment rounds and (b) the total amount invested in these rounds in the 2008–2017 period:
As you can see, after an explosion in SaaS seed funding from 2008 to 2015, which was fuelled by the rise of institutional seed financing and a strong acceleration in SaaS adoption, SaaS seed funding has indeed dropped sharply in the last two years: Both the number of deals and dollar amounts have approximately halved after peaking in 2014 and 2015, respectively. It might be worth pointing out that even though we’re now back to 2011/2012 levels, the numbers are still 4–7x higher compared to 2008 (depending on whether you look at the number of deals or dollar amounts). In 2018 we’ll find out if the 2016/2017 drop was just a correction following an excessive amount of seed funding in 2013–2015 or if the decline will continue.
Next, let’s take a look at how the average size of a SaaS seed round has evolved in the last ten years:
I don’t know about you, but to me, this chart was a surprise. I would have thought that the average round size has gone up much more sharply in the last years. I have some concerns regarding the data quality (for example, how reliable the Crunchbase data is for seed stage convertible loans, which have become much more popular over the last years), but it’s pretty clear that $2–3M seed rounds are still rare outliers, while the majority of seed rounds are significantly sub $1M.
Next up is the same data for Series As, Bs, Cs and Ds:
Looking at these charts we can observe a couple of things:
Here’s another way to look at the data, combining the numbers for all stages in one chart:
Again, what stands out is that while seed investments have peaked in 2015 and declined in the last two years, Series-A-and-up investments have continued to grow in the last years. As a result, only 4% of the total amount invested into SaaS went into seed rounds in 2017. In 2013 that percentage was close to 10%.
One question I had was whether the growth in SaaS funding could have been driven by increased investment activity in developing countries and if, maybe, there was a decline in Series A-D investing in North America and Europe, offset by growth in the rest of the world? Let’s look at the data:
As you can see, SaaS investments outside of North America and Europe have indeed grown dramatically, especially in the last years, and now account for a much larger share than 10 years ago. However, if you look at the blue bars only, you can see that investments in North America and Europe have grown, too.
Last but not least I wanted to take a look at the graduation rate, i.e. the percentage of startups that make it to the next round. To get an estimate for this number I assumed that, on average, it takes a startup 18 months to go from one stage to the next. Therefore I looked at how many companies have raised a seed round between July 2007 and December 2008, between January 2009 and June 2010, between July 2010 and December 2011, and so on, and did the same for Series As, Bs, Cs, and Ds. I then calculated the graduation rate by dividing the number of companies that have raised a seed round in one 18-month-period by the number of companies that have raised a Series A round in the following 18-month-period, and so on.
It’s important to note that this is a rough approximation because the assumption that companies move to the next stage after 18 months is highly simplistic. To get a more reliable answer to the graduation question we’ll have to go through all seed companies and check how many of them actually raised a Series A and do the same for other stages. This is probably possible with Crunchbase data but hey, it’s a Saturday evening, so please bear with me. :-)
With this caveat in mind, here’s the chart:
Given the ca. 9x increase of the number of seed rounds from 2008 to 2014, it’s not surprising that the graduation from seed to Series A has plummeted. Series A investors have kept the bar high, so while — according to this estimate — ca. 39% of the companies that raised a seed round between January 2012 and June 2013 went on to raise a Series A, only ca. 27% of the companies from the January 2015-June 2016 seed cohort went to the next stage.
Graduation from Series A to B, B to C, and C to D has decreased as well in the last years. Since, as we saw above, total funding dollars have increased across all these stages, this again suggests a trend towards more and more concentration. In other words, fewer and fewer companies make it to the next stage, but those that do, raise bigger and bigger rounds.
It will be very interesting to see if the decline in seed financing in 2016–2017 will lead to a slowdown of Series A rounds in 2018. It sounds obvious, because the number of companies that have raised a seed in 2016–2017 and are up for a Series A will be much smaller than the number of potential Series A candidates in previous years. Then again, there are lots of companies that need more time to get from seed to A, so who knows how many companies that were started several years ago will become ready for an A round next year.
The bigger question is if SaaS, as a category, has seen its peak. I won’t try to answer this question in this post, but I’m sure my colleagues and I will address it in future posts.

Be the first to respond.
A little more than a week ago, around 180 founders from our portfolio, the entire Point Nine crew including our advisors, and two handfuls of special guests convened in a beautiful hotel a bit outside of Barcelona to spend three days and three nights together. If you know us a little, you know that bringing our portfolio together, using online tools like Slack and Honey, as well as in the real world, has always been extremely important to us.
It all started with the very first PNC SaaS Founder Meetup, a one-day event that took place in San Francisco back in 2012. At that time, we thought that it would be nice to organize a little meetup that would give the founders of our (at that time still small) SaaS portfolio a chance to get to know each other better, compare notes, and learn from each other.
This changed everything.
Well, it didn’t have as much impact on the world as the launch of the iPhone, but it did have a big impact on us, and more importantly, on what we’ve meanwhile come to call the #p9family. After the meetup, many founders told us that they’ve never been to an event that was as useful as this one, and everyone left the meetup energized and eager to implement all the new learnings. It sounds so simple —put a bunch of early-stage SaaS founders into a room and add a few “2–3 stages ahead” SaaS founders and operators — but the result was almost magical. This might sound surprising if you read it today, but keep in mind what the world of SaaS looked like in 2012: SaaStr and SaaStock didn’t exist yet, Jason M. Lemkin was still at EchoSign/Adobe, David Skok was just getting started with his blog, and there weren’t many experienced SaaS entrepreneurs. In other words, it was hard to get good advice on how to build a SaaS company.
Today there is no shortage of startup advice, and yet, comparing notes with fellow entrepreneurs, learning from people who’ve done it before, and spending quality time with a trusted group of like-minded people hasn’t become less valuable. That’s why we’ve been organizing the PNC SaaS Founder Meetup every single year since 2012, and that is also why we’ve started organizing an equivalent event for the founders of our online marketplaces in 2015.
This year, we decided to merge what would have been the 7th annual PNC SaaS Founder Meetup and the 4th annual Point Nine Marketplace Meetup into one large Point Nine Founder Summit. To say that “This changed everything. Again.” might be a stretch, but finally bringing the entire portfolio together turned out to be a fantastic idea. And interestingly, we’ve found that although there are many SaaS or marketplace specific topics (say, selling to “elephants” or “whales” in SaaS, or increasing liquidity in marketplaces), plenty of the more than 45 keynotes and knowledge learning sessions were relevant for both SaaS and marketplace founders alike.
Below are some more visual impressions from the summit. Huge thanks once again to all speakers, moderators, and attendees from the #p9family, as well as Cristina Fonseca, Jason M. Lemkin, Zack Urlocker and all other guests for their support! We’re already looking forward to the next event in 2019.

This article was initially published on alka-web.com
In this article, I am going to share with you guys some development practices we adopted while building our first complete Entreprise Software Web Application using Vue.js. We have been through a long nerdy journey crafting Feedier.
In a nutshell, Feedier lets you collect valuable Feedback from your customers. We challenge you to understand your customers and engage with them through our reward and engagement programs. Brand unique & enjoyable surveys. Value, engage, respect & reward your customers! 🚀
feedier.com
Enough sales talk, let’s dive right in.
One of Vue.js core features are the object’s lifecycle. These give you utter control over what you want to do or set off, and when you want to.While building our application, although we had our internal best practices, .vue files making up our app started to get longer, and we could have rapidly lost track. Developers tend to use these hooks differently, for different purposes and would lay them out differently.For instance, some developers are keen on using the mounted hook for most of their data/API related code, while others would do that in the created hook. So you end up with inconsistency between your files.That’s when it started to be dreadful for us.
Bottom line? Discuss and agree on how you want to structure your files and use your framework’s features beforehand.
Is your application going to be translated? How are you going to handle the login and safety in your app? How would you design your database? These are question examples you should ask yourself before typing in any code. They are typically the kind of things we tend to implement later down the line, or tend to simply knock out, and by doing that, you increase your likeliness of breaking things. As a rule of thumb, don’t put these guys off and face them right from the inception!
If you get started on your first project, your team is most likely made of developers, or in other words, people eager to “build things”, and that would easily tend to forget about the main objectives: getting that application up on the market. It’s easy and attracting to implement stuff as soon as the idea comes in.But, would your target be interested in such feature? Is it expecting it in the beta version? And are your customers willing to pay for this supposedly ‘awesome’ feature? In other word, would that be a USP?The further you’re going away from your initial offer, the more you’re delaying your launch date.
One recommendation? Sure, get feedback, add features when everyone is convinced about their usefulness and requirement, but hold back from sinking your team in.We’ve dragged our development phased on — and it could have been cut way off.
When working on a team project, because you’re using one tool doesn’t necessarily mean that you get a grasp over it. Maybe it comes from a teammates, maybe you used to be comfortable with it but haven’t used it in a while, whatever is your the reason, you need to get yourself up to speed!Most of today’s modern tools are getting updated so often that we tend to miss important and stunning new features.The point is, read the doc again, be comfortable, it will save you time on the long run. Instead of rustling up a workaround, or looking for a solution in the doc, you will be confident from the beginning on.
Just to give you an example, at the beginning of our Feedier journey, we almost missed the Events Bus at the outset, so we were kinda coming up with our solution. And then we found out about that, so we changed everything. Worth doing it, but still, it could have saved us some hassles to do it from scratch.
Just shedding some lights into the available alternatives and why you would ditch your favorite console.log trick.Again, Vue offers its stunning development tool — Vue.js devtools — available on Chrome and Firefox. This plugin gives you extreme flexibility and definitely cut the development time back! Among other, it gives you the ability to tweak data value, navigate straight to the Vue.js component from the DOM inspector, flick through the different Events, and, first and foremost, gives you the data and computed properties values.For instance, while building our onboarding widgets, instead of fiddling with our API to mock some data and make sure the onboarded attribute was always false, we simply had to change its value in the browser. Easy peasy!
Toggling a boolean or change a data relying on a bunch of conditions, events and some API calls becomes a no-brainer.
Besides this, Webpack is also great when it comes to debugging. By simply using the eval-source-map property in your dev config, you get all of your .vue components available in the Browser and the right line mentioned when there is an error cropping up. One click, and you jump to the line, even though everything is bundled and compiled under the hood. Gorgeous, isn’t it?
Suffice it to say, you have everything you need for a decent working environment. You “just” have to build.
As most modern JS frameworks, Vue.js gives you have the ability to split your code into reusable components. This is brilliant, and that’s why before writing any code, you have to ask yourself:
Finding the right trade-off between too much props and not enough components is tough though. As a rule of thumb, avoid overrunning your components with props anyway!But that’s not all, you must also watch out for long clunky files that would make your experience as a developer worse and worse overtime. It was especially true with our JS helpers file. Every helper was just adding up, but the file became unusable. We had to break that up into a bunch of meaningful files, reaping the benefits of ES6 import/export features.Doing that from the outset would have saved us time, efforts and bugs.
Make no mistake, Open Source is fantastic ! Building a complete web applications takes a sh*tload of time and resources, that’s why it’s very tempting to rely on a NPM package to do your job whenever there is one available.It’s also really enticing to install the latest package that got very popular on Github last week, or was mentioned in a bunch of articles on Medium and seems useful for your project.But …. you actually have to factor in the real benefits of using it over building a simple handmade script that would do the job just fine! Our motto would be: draw it up yourself whenever you can! And only fall to the package back if it substantially reduce the amount of work, or you have no way but to do it.
Restricting yourself to the foremost plugins also reduce your overall script size and contribute to your web-app speed. That said, picking the right tools and avoid swamping yourself with the tons of packages isn’t a breeze!
By the way, if you’re wondering what is Apollo and GraphQL about, check out this article, we explain the nitty-gritty details about GraphQL and why it matters. It’s definitely worth reading. Long story short? If you’re still wondering how on earth you’re going to structure your Rest API — stop thinking, and jump straight into a GraphQL server, which is nicely integrated with the Apollo client thanks to this vue-apollo plugin.

To conclude, if you have a great business idea for your next application, don’t shy away — and move forward! Validate your idea rallying your friends’ feedback, and creating your Business Model Canvas. Then, get your MVP out, with the most important features, and collect feedback from that. You just want your users to get to that AHA moment as soon as possible. You have all the tech advices you need, let’s go!

Recently I assembled my “Top 15” list of Sales & Marketing mistakes SaaS startups make as things start to take-off. We’ve touched on quite a few of these before on SaaStr (will link to them), but I thought this might be a helpful checklist to challenge your thinking at a minimum.
We’ve all made many of these mistakes ourselves, myself included
I’m even making a few myself again. But if you see yourself making any of the mistakes below, it’s fairly easy to make a course correction. Just do it! It will help.
Sales:
Marketing:
Hiring is hard. Firing is even harder. But if a sales or marketing resource simply can’t get the job done, move on quickly. Otherwise, you are just wasting leads and time. Keeping a seat warm doesn’t help here. Your revenue per lead just goes down. Better to focus what is working on the handful of folks that can deliver until you have more folks that can do the same.

You want growth?
You want quick and actionable tactics to get you traffic, subscribers, sign-ups and paying customers?
These are 7 of the exact same tactics I use for my SaaS clients when I’m setting up a content marketing campaign. They are some of the most effective tactics that I’ve used.
Given that they are only “tactics” you should make sure that you are toning them to your unique voice, with your own unique style and brand approach.
Let’s jump right in, shall we?
1. Build your subscriber list using “Guides”
Create ebooks, worksheets, cheat sheets, templates, themes, interactive guides, or other valuable stuff that aligns with your customer’s core needs. Require an email sign-up to download or access them. Simple.
Wrap your resources around your customer’s pain points.
AppSumo did this perfectly with their “Validation Cheat Sheet” to help their users validate their business ideas quickly. The pain point was wrapped around the hesitation to validate, based on the notion that they did not know what questions to ask or what to measure. It was simple for Noah Kagan to put together this cheat sheet and wrap an email sign-up around it. He even says that this was specifically one of the most effective tactics they used to induce growth for their email list.
AppSumo’s main target is their email subscriber list of over ~750,000 subscribers, from whom they receive a 15-30% click through rate.
Think about that for a moment.
When they have something new to promote they drop an email and have an influx of anywhere from 112,500 to 225,000 impressions. That’s tremendous. Imagine having that kind of force to play with as a source of traffic and amplification for future content. This is why you need to build an email subscriber list now, and creating guides is a beautiful tactic to attract those subscribers quickly.
How do you wrap in the email subscribe?
This is how you build your subscriber list using guides.
2. Use Targeted Blogging to Build an Audience
Otherwise known as “Blogging for business” but really just basic content marketing.
What’s the difference between “targeted” blogging and “every-day” blogging? You have a defined audience and target in mind, and you are speaking in a medium that is native to that defined audience. You have an objective and a topic that you have honed your approach around to directly attract the customers you want to sign up.
This may sound a bit odd, so let me explain with an example.
Copyblogger teaches people to be better writers. People come to them to improve their writing, get better traffic to their blogs and attract more shares with their written work. That’s what they’re known for. What do they make their money from? Selling Wordpress themes, hosting services, plugins, and guides to those customers. They target subjects that will ignite the attention of their target customer — people who want to improve their writing — but through that build a following with value and trust for their products (targeted at those same writers).
As a content marketing consultant if I wrote about content marketing on an industry blog it might get me some notoriety within the industry, which would be great — but it wouldn’t make me much money. What would make me money is writing about how to improve your marketing to a bunch of entrepreneurs, because some will want to know more. See what I mean? It’s a fine line difference.
The goal here is to simply give value to your target audience where they are interested. Not just in what you offer, don’t just talk about features. Talk about what matters to them. Buffer — a social media management tool — does a great job with this for productivity. Buffer understands that their customer’s key concern and interest is optimizing their time and efficiency, and using science to prove it. So Buffer’s content team writes incredible posts about scientific studies to improve other areas of their lives, to be more productive in many areas, and often about how to improve their social media marketing as well.
It’s rather simple — but if you don’t think enough about it consciously and define your voice, audience, and the story for that audience it won’t connect and you will fail.
3. Create Interesting Infographics
Use data that is unique to you to create something interesting.
Like the “11 Untranslatable Words From Other Cultures” from Maptia. Okay, so this isn’t a typical “infographic” in it’s common “single image” form — but it is highly visually based, with a different image for each point. This is extremely interesting information, especially to Maptia’s target audience of traveling adventurers.
The goal here is social shares and inspiration through visual understanding. Also links, sweet, track-back links.
In this case there really is no “embed this” but typically you would have an embed box with a link that pointed back to your original page that you posted the infographic to. This way every time someone embedded the infographic in their post it would link back to you. If it’s a well positioned and interesting infographic, this could mean thousands of links from hundreds of domains. That looks good on search engines, and simply gets you more referral traffic. This specific infographic-focused post has over 57,000 social shares with links from the Huffington Post and Lifehacker.
With that many shares I doubt Maptia is experiencing much waldeinsamkeit.
4. Build a mob
Facilitate a large community of people excited to help each-other or otherwise engage. This will act as a subliminal force to fuel your own referral marketing.
I’ve written on this pretty extensively but basically you need to build a community around your business. Hubspot & Moz (well really Dharmesh Shah and Rand Fishkin) worked together to build the Inbound.org community. This is a place where inbound marketers could share information on email marketing, SEO, content marketing, CRO, branding or whatever else. This is really just to better the community, but also works as a user-generated source of brand awareness and referral traffic for both sources.
The Y Combinator did this exact thing with Hacker News which was actually the inspiration behind inbound.org. The Y Combinator, being a seed accelerator gained a massive amount of notoriety in the hacker community just by simply giving them a medium to share interesting information with each-other. Simple up and down-voting functionality makes it completely user-generated and self-replicates their traffic.
A community doesn’t have to be an up-and-down voting site either, it could be a number of things. It could be as simple as polarizing your audience as a visionary, as Steve Jobs did with his rebels.
Basecamp has done a great job of this, building a cult-like following around their SaaS product while they were 37signals by writing a few books like Rework and Remote driven by their belief systems. Also they gained a massive amount of credibility by building “Rails” for the very involved Ruby community, while they were simply using it to build their own tool, Basecamp. 37signals already had quite a bit of notoriety in the web design field before building Basecamp, so their initial growth of the product was bolstered by their already established reputation and community.
The key here is to build a following wherever it makes the most sense for you. Build a community for your company. With Bidsketch, their favored social channel and source of community is Twitter. They engage with their followers and have built a strong following by means of engagement and value. Buffer’s main community is their blog, where they wrap everyone in with incredible content, and then follow up with comments and engagements.
Build where it makes sense for you.
5. Integrate with other services
The fastest way to grow your audience is to adopt someone else’s.
Build an API for your business that you can use to connect to others, and that businesses can license to integrate with you.
Ruben Gamez, the founder of Bidsketch has said how influential this has been for his business growth. The day Bidsketch’s integration with FreshBooks went live was the #1 most signups he had to date. Bidsketch converted more sign-ups that day than the past 30 days combined.
These are some key take-aways from what Bidsketch experienced while integrating with Salesforce, Basecamp, Harvest and FreshBooks:
Here’s an example of Bidsketch’s landing page for their FreshBooks integration:
This landing page is still the highest converting page on Bidsketch’s site. Here is the beauty of this landing page, and what makes it so successful:
Obviously powerful integration, and perfectly executed marketing. This is one of many reasons why integrations can be so influential, especially for early stage startups trying to establish notoriety. A well established brand can help your reputation tremendously.
6. Build Referral Programs
Building “referral programs” is a great way to get traffic from businesses in your vertical while also providing great value to your customers. If you can contact a business and offer to give a % off of your product to their customers if they do the same for you, you can create a basic affiliate relationship and acquire access to a potentially huge audience that would be directly interested in your services.
This can be done on a B2B level or a B2C level.
Again, the best way to build an audience is to adopt someone else’s audience.
Buffer understands this well, and perfectly presents their integrations with some of the most widely used apps in their vertical. Each integration has a great use-case to their customers. It’s simple, it’s straight-forward, and every integration also helps Buffer. Buffer gets views from the Chrome App Store, from IFTTT’s possible “recipe” options, and from Feedly’s sharing. The list goes on, but this is an obvious B2C blowout for Buffer.
Moz uses their “Perks” page to build great B2B benefits for their customers. Moz negotiated discounts with businesses in their vertical to give % off of plans for their paying customers for other services that they know their customers use, or should use. This built relationships with these businesses that lead to reciprocal sign-ups from their respective audiences. Also when you’re a customer and you get a free benefit, you just feel awesome. Make your customers feel awesome.
There are plenty more examples, but essentially the answer is to find benefits for your customers, and negotiate a deal with companies that could help your customers and could bring you customers.
7. Build Free Stand-alone Tools
This is pretty costly, so if you’re just starting out this might be a tough pill to swallow. If you have some capital though, this is one of the best ways to spend it. Build tools that your customers will love and give it away for free. Either put a kick-back link to your site on the tool, or host it on your own sub-domain, then benefit from the amount of people using your free tool and discovering you in the process.
Neil Patel from Quicksprout knows that people reading his blog want to learn how to improve their site, so he took it a step further and created an in-depth analyzer that will tell them exactly what they need to do to get quick results for their site immediately. Now when you go to Quicksprout’s website you see a splash page like this:
You’re obviously intrigued if you’re looking to get more visitors, and Neil has a huge amount of users that put in their URL to be analyzed. When you put in your URL you will see an in-depth analysis that breaks down potential SEO improvements you could make on your site. Like this:
You can segment the information for competitor analysis, social media improvements or SEO improvements you can make, and what your site’s current grade is for all of these efforts. These are all topics that Neil focuses on in his blog.
Essentially Neil Patel just knows his audience, and knows what they could really benefit from. He built this to help his users, and also as a way to build his own referral traffic through inbound links, social shares, and email subscriptions to Quicksprout. You can get a full PDF report at the end of this analysis to improve your site if you want, and Neil gets another subscriber to his email list. It’s a win, win and will grow your audience just by solving their needs. For a bit more information on this you could see his blog post he also wrote about it which alone got 1,930 social shares.
There are plenty of other tactics to build your SaaS product’s audience, but these are 7 of my favorites that I’ve directly seen grow businesses tremendously. So how can you help your customers?
What guides can you write?
What integrations can you make?
What tools can you build?
Get started, tap that SaaS.

“…you have to be stupidly optimistic to win at business since most of the odds are against you.” — @jaltucher
Earlier this year my Shopify app Notify (now Fomo) was acquired. I was lucky enough to shepherd it through tremendous growth since its launch three years ago.
A decade of side projects came prior with mixed success. There’s no perfect recipe for a SaaS win - I’ve built beautiful apps that nobody used and unimpressive apps that got crazy popular. All of these experiments gave Notify a leg-up and I’m proud of its success.
Here are my takeaways for a successful SaaS venture.
Find your market first.
This eliminates half the battle. Early in my career, I’d adopted the mindset “all you need is a good idea” but good ideas are plentiful. The hard part is finding your market.
For Notify, Shopify store owners were the perfect market. The Shopify app store wasn’t saturated and my existing (free) app had generated a couple thousand leads — I could promote Notify immediately. Plus, I was familiar with the ecosystem and a built-in billing API made accepting payments a breeze.
Charge from day one.
Don’t start with freemium just because you’re scared of charging. Validate your product by asking for money. If you can get just one paying customer, more will follow.
I priced Notify at $14.99/month from the get-go. Relative to the App Store at the time, this seemed a little steep — but it paid for itself: an excited customer ran an Optimizely experiment and saw Notify increased their revenue by 19%. The higher price point seemed to create a feeling of exclusivity and attracted a loyal crowd that were passionate about my product.
Don’t stop releasing.
Deployment should be a delight. Have a production-like environment ready so you (or better yet, your tests) can safely examine each release.
With each additional user there was more pressure to keep the system working. Millions of notifications were being displayed every day. In the early days, pushing an update was always a risk. This was an unnecessary bottleneck. Setting up a staging server shifted me back into releasing daily and the product was better for it. Pro tip: automate your testing with Travis and Sauce Labs.
Say no.
“The secret to building half a product instead of a half-ass product is saying no. Each time you say yes to a feature, you’re adopting a child. You have to take your baby through a whole chain of events” — Jason Fried
This was a key factor in Notify’s success. I’d lost months in earlier ventures to feature creep. Becoming strict with Notify was a win. Features only made the cut if they were highly sought after or had a direct impact on growth — such as notification analytics or working towards new platforms.
Keep it lean.
It’s never been easier to deploy world-class applications. Stripe makes it simple to accept payments, AWS gives you access to huge amounts of infrastructure and CloudFlare distributes your content around the world for free. Don’t waste time reinventing the wheel.
With all of these resources I was able to throw together an MVP in a few days. At it’s peak, Notify was effortlessly running on only a few machines. CloudFlare absorbed half the traffic and served the app from ~100 data centres around the world, providing a lightning-fast experience to users everywhere. AWS scaled automatically, keeping costs down. Ten years ago building something at this scale would’ve been an expensive and chaotic nightmare.
Have a doomsday plan.
Plan for worst case scenario. Have access to database backups and know your deployment process inside and out.
I’ve been keeping websites & apps online for half of my life. The process lends itself to Murphy’s Law and Notify was no exception. Luckily, backups were painless to access and fresh environments were at the ready.
Avoid being the first point of contact.
When every customer has your personal contact details, it’s difficult to spend time on the important things.
The first year of growth was slow and steady, each month adding ~20 customers. Most of the growth came directly from the Shopify app store. Users were blogging about their success with Notify and organic shoutouts were happening everywhere. By late 2015, it wasn’t unusual to see 500 new customers a month. With growth came the need for around the clock support. I regret not outsourcing this sooner.
New customers aren’t the only way to grow.
Once you’ve got a solid client base, up-sell premium features and keep an eye on churn.
I was watching the ‘total users’ metric like a hawk. A good deal of customers were earning >$100K/month; peddling premium features would’ve been a good next step. Shopify apps typically have a high churn rate — for every two trial installs, one remained a customer. Since selling, the Fomo guys have reduced churn by shooting off an immediate personal welcome email.
Know when to exit.
All of a sudden this little side project had grown into a monster. It was taking over my life. Up at 5am to cram a few hours of work in before heading off to my real job, evenings and weekends disappeared. Constant emails, act-or-miss opportunities, a huge demand for other platforms, VC offerings. I’d become the bottleneck. Two choices: go full-time or exit.
Watching @ryanckulp & @justinmares take Notify to the next level has been unreal. Some of Fomo’s latest features blow my mind.
With the app in good hands I was afforded the opportunity to take a breather. I left my 9–5 at Sauce Labs in San Francisco to catch up on life. And it’s been a blast.
I finally took @angeldixon on a belated honeymoon, travelled with friends & family, set up house, nerded out on a Raspberry Pi, helped a buddy build his app, added to the family and I’m getting used to surfing on weekdays.
As the year closes I look forward to getting back into it. I’m more excited than ever to work on the next project.

This post is the last of a series of three articles on Systems of Record and Workflow Apps (Part 1 and Part 2). If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
As we’ve seen in the previous two posts the unbundling and democratization of Systems of Record (SORs in the rest of the post) lead to an explosion of new SORs players but also of Workflow apps which are flourishing in bigger and bigger software ecosystems.
We’ve transitioned from a world where the choices that a business had in term of software was rather limited to an age of software abundance and even overabundance is some categories.
This trend from scarcity to overabundance is not a new phenomenon specific to the B2B software world. In fact this transition happened many times throughout human history (ex: invention of the printing press) and seems to be accelerating with digital platforms: overabundance of music (on Spotify, Soundcloud, iTunes…), of video games (on Steam), of mobile apps (on iOS and Android), of video content (Youtube), of goods (Amazon) etc…
And when you look at this transition, three sets of challenges seem to emerge with it:
In the first part of this post we’ll first analyze what these challenges imply for the SaaS world and what solutions are emerging to solve them.
Then in a second part we’ll try to guess how the software landscape could evolve by exploring two distinct scenarios.
My current take on this topic is that the situation is not evenly distributed for every software category and vertical.
In many horizontal categories it’s true that businesses have now the choice between plenty of software with little differentiation. Just check at the 159 email marketing tools or the 172 sales management tools on GetApp and you’ll understand what I mean.
But not all horizontal categories are that crowded and horizontal software is not the answer for every problem. Some needs are better handled by specialized vertical tools which are still too few.
To answer the question: no the whole SaaS market is not saturated yet but the major horizontal categories are (or start to be) and in many non saturated verticals or niches the trend is going toward more and more competition.
The challenges
The distribution & discovery challenges are probably the most obvious pain points that arise when a product or a content becomes overabundant: How can users discover the particular products / content they need or want when they have hundreds or thousands of choices before their eyes?
What makes this problem very difficult to solve at scale is that each user as its own definition of what he needs that generally depends on many different factors.
This situation is no different in the B2B software world. As we’ve seen above, in some categories, businesses have access to hundreds of software that are doing the same things with very little differentiation. And what makes software recommendation complicated are the hundreds of factors than need to be considered: business size, budget, requirements in terms of product, of SLAs, of security, of devices supported, of integration with other software and platforms…
The solutions
When you look at the other industries that went from scarcity to overabundance such as the music, the video game or the mobile app industries you’ll notice that the same pattern emerges when it comes to solutions to the discovery & distribution problems:
When you look at what is happening in the software world the same pattern seems to take shape:
What’s coming next
When you look at the situation in the other industries I’ve mentioned you notice that the players which are dominating discovery are very often the distribution platforms themselves (from Spotify to Amazon which is threatening Google on product search) followed by the aggregators, curators and media which tend to have less power.
A huge advantage of distribution platforms is that they collect plenty of data about each user and can hence offer more personalized recommendations compared to stand alone aggregators.
The B2B software market is probably less structured and less mature on the distribution and discovery side but the current trend is clearly going toward the emergence of big software platforms (the SORs) where users increasingly search and consume other software.
Whether it’s on SalesForce, Slack, Google Apps or Hubspot I think users will increasingly use these platforms not only for the core software they provide but also to find other tools that integrate well with them.
Stand alone aggregators will continue to exist but I doubt they’ll take over the SORs in terms of size and power. They’ll stay good complimentary places where to search for software but unless they move up the stack and offer more than just discovery they’ll stay relatively small.
So far I’ve spoken about the players which are providing these discovery and distribution features but what about the players which are appearing in the results? The SaaS and workflow apps which are not platforms and want to be discovered by the users.
The main observation is that, in general, in a crowded environment the biggest players also end up dominating discovery results while smaller players are limited to the long tail.
Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Snapchat are dominating the various iOS and Android rankings. Rihanna, Justin Bieber or Drake are the most streamed artists on Spotify. The biggest video game editors are dominating Steam 2016 best selling list.
The same situation can be expected in the SaaS world. The more SaaS and SORs will be available on the market the more likely only a few big players will dominate the discovery results and the more difficult for new software it will be to break through.
The challenges
The second common set of challenges that emerges when you’re transitioning from a situation of scarcity to overabundance is linked to usage. The more you accumulate content and products the more you’ll feel:
For the software world it means:
The solutions
Again if we look at what is happening in the other industries the major distribution platforms seem to play a big role when it comes to answering the usage problems. To access, search and use your library of songs you will directly use Spotify or iTunes. Same for your library of video games whether it’s on Steam, the Playstation Network or else. The mobile app stores also offer plenty of features that are the equivalent to the single sign on, that enable you to update all your apps from a single place or even to share access to your purchased apps and content with your family.
The B2B software market is evolving on two parallel tracks when it comes to solving these problems:
SORs
When you look at the evolution of major SORs it’s clear that they increasingly tackle the usage challenges. On their way to becoming platforms many of them not only offer an internal “appstore” (for discovery) but also features that help you manage the third party apps of their ecosystem.
For instance on SalesForce Appexchange once you chose a third party software you can define who at your company will have access to the tool. In terms of security SalesForce guarantees a certain level of security by checking that each app “meets a set of security standards and best practices thanks to qualitative and quantitative reviews”. Of course you can plug / unplug each 3P tool anytime you want and you have migration features that help you move from one app to the other.
The majority of current SORs are not as advanced as SalesForce when it comes to these features but more and more of them are going toward that direction. Slack is a good example as it is increasingly used as a hub for 3rd party apps.
Stand alone API platforms
The “usage” pain is actually so common and big in the SaaS world that a whole category of tools has emerged to tackle it. In the past 5–6 years many API platforms have been launched to enable businesses to connect the SaaS they use and automate workflows (Zapier), centralize scattered customer data (mParticle, Segment), move data around (Hull.io), monitor costs and manage usage (cloudability, Cloudyn) or control user identity (Okta).
APIs have become a crucial piece of the software ecosystem and are especially useful for solving the different usage problems.
My personal opinion is that these “usage” challenges have a higher potential to give birth to huge companies compared to the discovery one.
What’s coming next
When it comes to solving these usage problems I don’t see major new approaches emerging in the next months / years. I think what we’ll see is an acceleration of both trends:
The big question is how these different pieces will fit together as these different platforms grow. Will major SORs acquire some of these API platforms to lock even more the market? Are the usage challenges big enough to gives birth to multi-billion $ API platforms? Do these API platforms have the potential to move up the stack and disrupt current SORs?
The challenges
What causes a market to transition from scarcity (of product / good / content) to overabundance? (here I’m speaking in the context of a digital world)
At the core of this transition is the sudden enlargement of a market that can be caused by its maturation or / and by the emergence of new distribution channels. As this available market is growing, it attracts more and more content / product providers which in turn attracts more and more pick and shovel sellers (= the services that help providers to create their product / content).
And once critical mass is reached, these loops often lead to the commoditization of the content / products sold on this market: the costs to produce a piece of content or a product drops, the quantity of available items explodes, leading to an increasing competition which drives the prices down. And on digital platforms it very often means the commoditization of these products / content.
This is what is currently happening to the music industry: the costs to produce a song have dropped significantly, large distribution channels are available (Spotify, Youtube, iTunes, Soundcloud…) for free or cheap, the offer keeps increasing and on the demand side it costs me only 10$ per month (my Spotify account) to access an almost unlimited number of songs, including the new releases. And the dynamics are the same for the video games or mobile apps industries (yes, people are offended to see Nintendo selling its Mario game 10$ on the appstore, they are not used to it anymore).
On the software side we’re far from cheap or free unlimited SaaS everywhere but we can notice:
But commoditization doesn’t happen overnight and doesn’t affect every category and customer segment at the same time and at the same pace. What we can notice is that for an increasing number of use cases you can find cheap SaaS or very generous freemium versions that are enough for the majority of users (and the big customers will pay premium versions).
For example there’s no shortage of good free project management tools, you can send every month thousands of emails for free via Mailgun, Mailjet or else, you have access to numerous cheap and very good 10$ / month marketing tools, a lot of developer APIs offer very generous freemium version (e.g: Algolia) etc…
So I’m not saying that the B2B software market is already commoditized as a whole but the movement has certainly started in some categories and for specific customer segments. What’s still uncertain is whether this trend will continue to widespread (and how fast) or if it will stay limited to some areas.
In that perspective there’s a growing discussion in our industry about the commoditization of Workflow apps. As a quick reminder SORs are the tools that serve as “the single source of truth about a particular department or company” (e.g SalesForce for your customer data) while workflow apps are the SaaS that enable people to work and collaborate (e.g: video conference tools and most project management tools are workflow apps).
At the heart of this discussion is the belief that the main barriers to entry of pure Workflow apps, which are UX/UI and infrastructure, were enough a couple years ago when the market was not as crowded and when customers were still stuck with ugly products. But the situation has evolved and UX/UI as well as infrastructure are not moats anymore because customers are much more educated and because copying UX/UI and scaling infrastructure can be achieved more easily thanks to the myriad of shovel sellers available nowadays.
What increasingly counts are the moats such as data or network effects and this is why SORs currently don’t face the same danger as workflow SaaS. Business data cannot easily be “copied” by a competitor and the more critical data you have about a business the harder it is for the business to migrate to another solution. And that still stands, for now at least.
What’s coming next
Again to try to guess what could come next let’s have a quick look at what is happening in other industries.
Whether it’s the music, the video games, the entertainment content or the mobile apps industry, what’s common to them is that the commoditization process completely shakes up the value chain from production to business model.
In the music industry the business model for an artist is slowly shifting from revenue generated by album sales to making most of his money on concert or merchandizing and music streaming. People consume music for very cheap / almost for free (Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud…) but spend money on the “services” around what has become the commodity (songs).
Whether it’s on mobile on or desktop the trend is the same for the video game industry. More and more video games editors offer the core video game for very cheap / free and generate revenue through in apps purchases, addons (DLC), merchandizing and events (e-sport).
Same for mobile apps for which users are now very reluctant to pay more than a couple of dollars or for online entertainers which are offering their Youtube videos / podcasts for free and monetize their audience through merchandizing or websites such as Patreon.
In the context of B2B software the interesting trends worth keeping an eye on are:
From a general perspective what we’re seeing is that the major SORs are transitioning to platforms and protect themselves from commoditization by:
On the workflow SaaS side the ones which rely mainly on better UX/UI will increasingly be threatened (and I’m wondering if the sale of Trello to Atlassian is not a good illustration of this trend). This is why more Workflow apps try to add AI / ML to their mix to avoid being copied too easily.
Now that we have covered these 3 sets of problems in details let’s step back and see what it could imply for the B2B software industry in the next few years.
At a macro level it seems that more and more SORs are transitioning to platforms and could lock the major software categories by:
We’re still at the beginning of this movement and not all SORs are progressing at the same speed but if this trend continues it could result in a landscape similar to the Microsoft — SAP era where a bunch of major software providers (here the SORs) dominate the market making it extremely hard for newcomers to displace (until the next innovation cycle).
But it doesn’t mean it’s the end of other big software companies. A huge difference between the on-premise era and now is the platform aspect. For instance Veeva is a billion dollar company built on top of SalesForce platform, and as more SORs platforms are emerging and maturing we can expect to see more billion dollar companies like Veeva to get built on top of them.
Another consequence is the multiplication of very healthy and profitable SaaS businesses that will not reach the hundreds millions of dollars valuation but will be “successful and profitable companies that generate life-changing wealth for the founders and great returns for early investors” as Christoph writes it.
These “successful and profitable” companies need to be fuelled by alternative way of financing (than traditional equity based investors) this is why we’re witnessing the rise of revenue based, crowdfunding, debt and cash flow financing services such as Lighter Capital, SaaS Capital, Crowdcube etc.
In the second scenario workflow apps could actually threaten SORs and replace them in a near future.
The main argument here is that as UX/UI stopped being a major barrier to entry, data (which SORs control) could also take the same path due to the rise of AI/ML.
Successful SORs are very valuable because they managed to collect critical data from businesses and since collecting this data is a long and complicated process, businesses tend to stick with the same provider (lock in effect).
But what if collecting data thanks to automation, bots, AI, machine learning or other emerging tech becomes 100 times easier and automated? Would SORs be still that valuable? Could they lock users as efficiently as they do right now?
Another interesting bet can be made on the standalone API platforms. API platforms like Hull.io (disclaimer we’re investors in them) enable business data to flow between SaaS and it’s not far fetched to think that such tool could build unique data sets.

https://blog.efounders.co/15-saas-predictions-for-2015-5dfecb0a783c?source=search_post---------272,"At eFounders, we’ve launched 7 SaaS products in 3 years. As a startup studio, we’re watching the trends in order to build only successful startups. This list is, of course, non-exhaustive, and we’d love to hear your comments.
Software products will be available for free, meaning they will get a very large user base. As a consequence, we will observe a B2C-ish indirect business model arise, based on lead generation or advertising for example.
Inspiration: Quartzy, Zenefits, eFounders’ project OfficeX
Voice will conquer enterprise for support, training, and even communication. The advantages of voice, compared to text, are that it doesn’t need an interface and perfectly fits portable and wearable devices.
Inspiration: Aircall, Solved, CodeMentor, AirPair, Twilio
Software has been eating the world for few years already. There is now a software for almost each specific industry and jobs. This trend is going to strengthen, and get to all sorts of jobs, doctors, lawyers, hairdressers, etc. Each needs a new, user-friendly and affordable software to replace outdated tools.
Inspiration: Clio, Lightspeed
The buzzword (that was already a buzzword for the few SaaS lovers around here) is “uberization”. It means that On-Demand Services like Uber will be copied by food delivery companies, cleaning companies, etc. This trend started with individuals, but will reach the enterprise world, which leads to opportunities for new stakeholders.
Inspiration: ManagedByQ, Uber for business
There will be more and more B2B businesses completely based on mobile with no or almost no web/desktop version. It is convenient for many employees than have no desktop at work but smartphones or tablets.
Inspiration: Slack, ShowPad
We’re likely to observe the same trend for connected objects: if the Internet of things was mainly a consumer issue, there’s a great chance to see connected objects leveraging communications of productivity issues in the enterprise world -in other words, a “nestification” of economy.
Inspiration: GetKisi, LocalMotion, Viewsy
The B2B world is still full of intermediates that are costly and outdated. It leaves great opportunities for SaaS players to get rid of this intermediation.
Inspiration: Solved, Illustrio, Textmaster
Inbound marketing will become essential to SaaS businesses, big and small, also outside the U.S. They will become their own media: they will need to rely on their own metrics and use their own voice to leverage content as a user acquisition and retention channel.
Inspiration: Hubspot, Helpscout, Intercom, Mention
Although SaaS businesses target international markets, there will be more and more SaaS focused on specific geographical regions, especially to handle accounting, HR, or legal issues — that differ from one country to another
Inspiration: Clerky, Concur
The sharing economy is everywhere: it will be in the enterprise world as well. The advantages brought to consumers by P2P can be applied to B2B: greater efficiency, adaptability, cost. Next buzzword: airbnbinization?
Inspiration: Crowdsource, Storefront, Flow2
SaaS and enterprise Internet giants like SalesForce, Oracle, Google, Linkedin, Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow, or Adobe will continue to acquire businesses in the US and also start in the rest of the world. Ex: Adobe acquired Neolane and Fotolia.
For software focused on Fortune 5,000 000 companies (as opposed to Fortune 500), such as Mailchimp, Hootsuite or SurveyMonkey, “more and more” and “bigger and bigger” will become the next unicorn.
We’ll witness a fundraising acceleration, more and more “giants” rounds of funding like Slack’s, Zenefit’s or Domo’s funding.
This year’s IPOs: after Zendek, Hubspot or New Relic, entreprise IPOs will continue with companies like Atlassian or Box.
We can expect good performance for public SaaS companies after a not-as-bad-as-expected 2014 year (New Relic, Hubspot, Zendesk, Tableau).
We build the future of work.

As I write this obituary, it does not feel like Ashok is no longer with us. Startup founders lead a difficult life, and very few have had the courage to persevere and succeed as Ashok did. Ashok was the person I knew the best in the startup ecosystem and I felt I shared a special bond with him. I used to go frequently to him for advice for my startup (he was helping many other founders on a personal level), and he used to lean on me to talk about philosophy and fulfillment. It feels unreal that he just disappeared into nothing, without even saying goodbye. He was 32.
For those who did not know Ashok, he was a graduate of BITS Pilani and had been a part of multiple startups. His most successful startup was ReportGarden, which was nominated for the prestigious ET Startup awards in 2017. In that sense, Ashok was one of the more successful SAAS (software as a service) founders in India. At the time of his untimely death, he was well onto his next venture, SalesBenefits. He knew so much about B2B software startups (software that is sold to companies, not individual consumers), that he once told me he could take any B2B startup and make it successful. “Dude, I can make more money from ERPNext than you”, he used to joke to me.
In 2017, Avinash Raghava (co-founder of iSpirt and SAASBoomi) and the ecosystem builder of SAAS startups in India, created a small cohort of founders whom he thought could learn from each other. This is where Ashok and I first met. As a part of this cohort, we would meet every few months in a different city and chat about our startups and challenges that we faced. At the time Ashok was building ReportGarden. We talked about our personal and work challenges, shared tactics and strategies and finally philosophy. Often Ashok and I found ourselves at the opposing end of the philosophical debates and it enriched both of us.
I vividly remember the time we spent in Mumbai. I could sense that Ashok really loved the city. As we did a walking tour of the Raj era Fort district, he said, “I can feel a city by the way people walk. In Mumbai, people always seem to walk with a sense of purpose. In Hyderabad, we don’t even have sidewalks”. He was inspired by the wealth creators, the Marwari business families who built generational wealth.
Ashok and I also shared a common passion, science fiction. While he was a way more prolific reader than I, we used to recommend books to each other and discuss them. Ashok specially loved space operas, where the saga of human societies span generations and galaxies. I think his favorite was the Foundation series by Asimov, while he was also a big fan of the Red Rising, Broken Earth and Interdependency series.
Both of us looked at our role as startup founders in the context of the epic saga of human struggle. He was a firm believer in capitalism, accumulation and arbitrage, whereas I came from a more philosophy, art and freedom side of things. In our last debate, we were discussing the role of experimentation in startups. Ashok loved narrow experiments, while I liked broad ones. Both of us loved to take each other down. As we began to know each other better, he used to joke “I am becoming more like you, and you are becoming more like me”.
Ashok had his ups and downs. He had failed multiple times before seeing success at ReportGarden. Even that success came at a big cost of personal anxiety. Startups are exceedingly hard. Software is the gold rush of our times. The only industry where you can legitimately create billions of dollars of wealth in a span of a few years. As technology is rapidly changing how societies are organized, it throws up opportunities to accumulate incredible wealth.
Startups that cross a billion dollars in value, called unicorns, are specially coveted. Investors, sensing the gold rush, are pouring in millions of dollars, behind founders like Ashok who are expected to go out there smash it all over the park like IPL batsmen. But entrepreneurship is not really a sport with simple rules. It is a highly risky venture without rules where a very large proportion of startups end in failure. Fate, timing and who you went to school with, also have a big role to play in successful startups. Entrepreneurs who succeed in “hypergrowth” are celebrated as heroes, while those who fail to reach certain milestones are destined to be trashed into the dustbins of history as also-rans. This puts tremendous pressure on entrepreneurs to succeed at all costs.
Ashok was a very sensitive and intense person, and he was under a lot of pressure. While he put on a brave face, he had also confessed to some of us that he was suffering from pain and depression. Entrepreneurship was a game which he was both winning and losing, and it had left him perplexed and anxious. Thankfully for him, things seemed to fall in place for him of late. He had raised capital from marquee investors for his latest startup, and the last most of us talked with him, he was bullish on plans of making it big. He had recently moved to Singapore and told us that he loved his life there, he ran regularly and spent time with his family on weekends. His untimely death came as a bolt out of the blue.
At the time of writing, I am not aware of the cause of death. Whatever it is, it will not reduce the grief all of us feel in the SAAS ecosystem for Ashok. He was one of our best and he was taken away too early. I was looking at our WhatApp chat, and this April when he was raising capital again, and he had just turned 32, he told me he felt like he was 41 (same age as me). We chatted about our life and entrepreneurship and he beautifully summarized his feelings about startups.
That is when I feel real joy man. Getting a customer. I can’t get over that feeling. It doesn’t get old.
His passing away is a huge loss for the entire ecosystem. Those who knew him, never got a chance to say goodbye, and he lives in all our memories. He is survived by his wife and 2 year old son.

Jan 15, 2017·26 min read
Looking back at my last five years with two Atlanta software-as-a-service (SaaS) startups, I feel like I could write a heavy book about everything I’ve learned. It would be impossible to fit everything on a single page, but I’ve decided that it’s time to put some things in writing.
I hope something here will help you. Maybe you can learn from my mistakes.
Let’s start with the foundation and work towards what you need to know as you grow.
One of my favorite startup veterans told me, “First, decide who you want to help. Once you know your target audience, you can start to build a business based on the problems those people need to solve.” This way, if the problem changes or goes away, you can always pivot to solve other problems that those people need to solve. You won’t have to start over building new relationships from scratch.
We spend a lot of time constructing detailed personas. What industry does this person work in? What’s their job title? What kind of pasta sauce do they prefer?
Personas guide key messages, content, and product experiences, but they’ll never be perfect. Your users belong to a cohesive audience, but they’re all special snowflakes. Look for use cases (the problems people are trying to solve) and flesh out personas from there. It’s easier than doing it the other way around.
Why does your company do what it does? Every single person on your team needs to be able to articulate the mission of the company, not just the plan for how you’re going to hit your revenue goal this quarter. Some smart people skip this part or don’t articulate their missions clearly because they assume they don’t have to. Indulge in a little idealism. Pick the right words. Repeat them until they stick.
How does your company make life better for people? Does it improve a workflow? Does it make a job easier to do? How will that impact your user or your customer’s bottom line? Make sure everyone at your company can repeat this back to you. Slap it somewhere prominent on your website.
It’s easy to blow your budget on overhead, expensive events, fancy meals, and Lyft rides charged to the company card. You will see other startup founders living large and feel pressured to do the same.
Ignore them. Or, assume that they were independently wealthy before starting their companies.
Work remotely or out of a closet until you absolutely need somewhere to bring prospective clients. Always be outgrowing your office space.
If you do decide to move into a co-working space, don’t treat it like an office. The value of a co-working space isn’t just the shared expenses and the free coffee; it’s the community and the engineered serendipity that comes from sheer physical proximity. If you’re not bartering services with the other SaaS startups in your space, you’re missing out on opportunities for advice, valuable input, and advocate marketing.
Do you know how much it costs to run a specific feature? At scale? Figure it out. Make sure everyone on your team knows. Otherwise, you risk discounting below the cost of the feature and losing money offering the service.
Watch out for tools that sound cheap but charge per seat. They work great with small teams, but they get costly as you grow. No one likes to share a seat after they’ve had it to themselves, so if you’re planning to share it in the future, set up the username up with an email address like “this-team@yourcompany.com.”
Speaking of logins…
It’s good for security and makes life easier. Stop wasting time with those ‘Forgot Password?’ links.
When you start a company, you’re taking on a huge financial risk. My friends who are founders stay hush-hush about the specific numbers and how they’re making it work, but I have pieced together that lots of founders are paying themselves next to nothing or operating on “friends and family money.” If your friends and family don’t have any money, prepare personal savings and plan to adjust your lifestyle.
If you have predictable cash flow, you don’t have to take venture capital. You’ll grow slower, but you’ll retain more control over the organization. You can partner with individual investors to secure increments of cash as needed. Eventually, when you have enough revenue, you can apply for a line of credit to grow faster.
How many times have you seen a startup with a questionable revenue model blow up only to announce layoffs a year later? I haven’t been on the inside of this yet, but I suspect that this happens when people take more money than they know what to do with. If you’re taking large amounts of cash, you need a plan to put it to work.
Articulate your personal core values. As soon as your company has more than one employee, identify your common core values and write them down. Having defined values will help you attract great talent and stay aligned as your team grows. It’s hard work to enforce values after you’ve built out your team, so start early. Keep core values close and practice them when making daily decisions.
Bar carts. Beer fridges. Open bars. Kegs on every floor. Champagne toasts. Bloodies and mimosas over brunch. Pitchers of margs over lunch. Happy hours with the squad.
Practicing moderate, healthy alcohol consumption can be super challenging when there’s always something to celebrate. Between parties for company milestones, networking events, monthly meetups, and “I need a beer because <insert stressful work problem here>” it’s easy to get out of hand at the office.
Startup life didn’t cause my drinking problem (it was already there), but it did make it harder to keep under control. If I could do the last 5 years over, I would practice celebrating without booze.
Ideas:
Speaking of perks…
Startup perks are tricky business. They attract new talent. They may make current talent happier. And, they may make more conservative employees feel like you’re wasting money that could be in their paychecks instead. Be transparent about the cost of perks and why you’re providing them.
Once you introduce a perk, it hurts to take it back. Make sure that you have resources to provide the perk to new employees at scale.
Personal favorite perks:
Speaking of remote work…
Yes — some work feels better in person. Video conferences are glitchy and kludgy. There’s nuance in body language that gets lost in conversations on the phone or via Slack. That feeling when you have your people in a room throwing ideas at a whiteboard is pure magic. Sometimes it feels so magical than you let it run on for four hours until someone says, “Holy crap. I forgot to eat lunch and I didn’t get anything done today.”
At some point, you’re going to need to accommodate remote workers without treating them like second-class citizens. Not everyone is a culture-fit for a remote-first company, and that’s okay. If part of your business plan is to grow to a 50 or 150 or 10,000 person company, implement a remote-first culture early. You’ll be more efficient and everyone will feel like they’re on equal footing.
Here are two awesome blog posts about how and why to do that well:
Speaking of equal footing…
Transparency means making information available to everyone on the team. It’s the foundation of trust, teamwork, and innovation.
100% transparency isn’t possible. Some personal information must be confidential between employees and managers. But, most information about financials, business goals, and hiring plans should be shared without concern. If you’re keeping something a secret, ask yourself “Why?” five times.
I could go on and on about this because transparency is one of my personal core values, but Joel at Buffer totally nailed it, so read his blog post about defaulting to transparency if you need further convincing.
While I’m grateful that I’ve never experienced overt sexism or discrimination at a startup, I often hear things that make me uncomfortable, angry, and less trusting of my friends.
microaggressions: plural noun, those little things that people say off-hand that get under your skin and you wonder if it’s even worth calling it out but if you don’t call it out then you can’t stop thinking about it and later you wish you’d stood up for your damn self.
If you hear something, say something. This isn’t just about letting someone know how you feel. It’s about building a supportive, positive culture for other people on your team, too.
If you get called out, acknowledge it, apologize, and change your behavior. Nobody’s perfect and we’re all learning. If someone else feels threatened or discriminated against, it’s not about who’s right and who’s wrong. Their feelings are real and valid. Convincing them otherwise won’t earn their respect.
Early-on, you will build features or products specifically to meet the needs of literally anyone who will give you any money. That’s okay. Build it and know that you might kill it later.
As you grow, it’s important to do more research to validate ideas for new features with your existing customers and prospective customers. Take down specs and use low-fidelity mock-ups to test your ideas with people before you build them.
Public-facing idea exchanges, like UserVoice feedback forums, are fantastic for letting people know that you care about user-driven development. You don’t have to build every feature that’s requested, but you should reply to every post. If you don’t, users will think your Idea Exchange is a “black hole” and they’ll start hitting up support instead.
Treat replies on user forums like you’d treat social media messages from your company’s brand. Respond quickly. Keep it professional. Proofread before sending. Take follow-up questions offline. Your user idea forum isn’t the place to ask questions and probe for clarity. Reach out via email or book a meeting to continue the conversation.
If you publish a release date for a new feature, you’ll make a liar out of yourself. Do your best to estimate timelines and share rough estimates with customers who ask for them, but never commit to a release date. Things come up. The app could burn to the ground. Your best engineer could get hit by a bus. (Seriously. People die, y’all. It totally sucks.)
“Based on our current roadmap and resources, it seems like this feature may be available some time before the end of Q4” is safer than “We’re launching this new feature on October 1st.”
New features won’t sing if they’re slow. If your new dashboard has all of the bells and whistles but it takes more than 2 seconds to load, does it even matter? Include performance goals for speed and reliability when you’re designing new features.
A CEO that I know got his company off the ground with hundreds of users before he ever sent out a press release. His app looked great and people believed it would work. Visual design impacts how people perceive the reliability and value of your product. Thoughtful web and graphic design encourage trust in your brand.
Every extra word, icon, and form field contributes to clutter. When designing UI elements for new features, make it a game to see how little you can add.
When we write technical documentation, we go over the top to explain every component of the feature. This is a great exercise. But, if your technical documentation for a new feature requires a ton of instructions about how to use it, step back.
Why do we need to explain how this works? Could we make this more intuitive?
When you’re designing new features similar to what your competitor has already rolled out, there’s nothing wrong with doing your research. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.
For example, it’s smart to use similar words and labeling. Someone comparing you to a competitor will know right away that you both have that feature. They can check the box on their list faster.
But, when a user or a member of your team asks, “Why did you do it that way?” if the only answer you can offer is, “That’s how <our biggest competitor> did it” then you’re being lazy. Know why you picked this particular design direction instead of other options. Be able to communicate that clearly to your team and your users.
If you’re tight on space for form fields, use a float label so people remember what they’re supposed to put into the field. It’s hard to remember what the field needs while you’re also typing.
“Oh, come on. It’s not that hard.”
Yes, it is. Recently I submitted an inbound form that was looking for “Email” and “Name.” Out of habit, I typed my email and my password and hit enter.
“Whelp. Seems like as good a time as any to go update my LastPass password…”
Offices don’t always have accessible wi-fi connections; know how to demo your app with .pdf slides.
No one will have a USB input compatible with your computer and your laptop will die.
Departure times printed on tickets refer to when the plane will be taking off the ground, not when you need to show up to get on the plane. People who travel often know this, but I didn’t travel often before working with startups. I learned this lesson the hard way and missed a flight for an on-site meeting with a new customer in New York. When the customer eventually churned, they said it was because of a product feature, but I can’t help wondering if it would have gone a different way if I’d started the relationship on the right foot.
Big Enterprise companies have multiple offices, sometimes multiple offices in the same city. Double-check the address and the floor. I can’t tell you how many times I thought I was going to be comfortably early for a meeting and ended up running to get across town in heels. (It was six times).
The best sales reps on my team were close with their favorite buyers. From WhatsApp to SnapChat, no channel was off limits. I thought it was weird and totally unprofessional until I started going on-site with my reps. When we rolled into a new town to meet a client, they treated us like old friends. They took us to their favorite restaurants. They gave us genuine, scathing suggestions that we needed to grow.
Yes — marketing inbounds will come in. And, if you’re working with a sales or business development team, they’ll help source deals, too. But, at the end of the day, if you can’t do your job because you’re sitting around waiting for a qualified lead to come in, you’re not going to be successful selling at a startup. Take control of your destiny. Start prospecting your dream deals.
Some companies hate slide-decks. Others require them. Let your contacts know what to expect from a demo and make sure it aligns with their needs.
“I typically start by asking questions to understand your goals and then jump into a live demo of the app. Will this work for you? Or, should we prepare something more formal for your team?”
Excellent sales reps can spin a $100,000 deal into a $300,000 deal by understanding a company’s budget and presenting a package that provides value within the budgeted range. But, hiding your pricing page causes trust issues (remember: transparency matters). It could also mean that you spend a ton of time talking to people who want and can’t afford your product.
Design a pricing model that’s simple and clear. Set prices a little bit higher than you think people are willing to pay. Publish it on your website. Discount as needed.
Integrations with other apps and services make your SaaS product stickier. They help bring your app into existing workflows. This helps prevent churn.
If an integration costs a ton of money to manage, charge for it or include it in a higher pricing tier to cover the cost; if not, give it away to anyone who wants it and it’ll pay for itself when accounts come up for renewal.
Startup sales teams love to give away testimonials. “Let us use your logo and we’ll cut a little off the price of your contract.” The problem is that when we sell a deal we don’t know with certainty that the product will work for the customer. If it ends up being a bad fit, you can’t do anything with that testimonial line item.
It’s less risky to work testimonial discounts into renewals. It’s also easier to execute on creating those testimonials when you have a well-established relationship with the customer.
When you name a company and buy a domain, the perfect Twitter handle isn’t always available. Someone may be sitting on the handle, or it could be associated with a deactivated account.
If you can’t lock down a handle that matches your business name, pick something that starts with your business name. For example, “@<your company>team” is better than “@Team<your company>” because it shows up first in a new search.
Treat hashtags like channels instead of keywords. When you include a specific hashtag in your post, you have the opportunity to connect with other people who use or follow that topic. If you’re hashtagging #every #word #in #the #post then you’re not being targeted enough with your messaging.
If you’re selling to business executives, LinkedIn isn’t a bad place to be. It’s got its problems but it’s less noisy than Twitter.
Analysts give us lists of key phrases and we parrot them back so everyone knows that we know what’s up. But, jargon words can get misinterpreted easily, especially if they relate to other popular jargon works.
For example, “performance management” and “digital performance management” are unrelated. The first relates to helping your employees succeed. The second relates to making sure all of your digital systems are working most efficiently.
Make sure that your key marketing messages avoid jargon words so that people know what you do right away.
I once stumbled on a B2B website with a huge background video (read: bad for page performance) with gigantic overlaid text reading, “We heart email.”
“Me too. But, what do you do? Do you help me send better email? Do you help me get more emails in my inbox? Don’t make it hard for me to figure this out. I’m on your website because I want to know whether you can help me.”
Slogans work best on t-shirts, coffee mugs, posters, and advertisements where you’re trying to appeal to an audience in a more passive way. If someone’s interested, they’ll check for your logo and put two-and-two together.
SaaS startup t-shirts are the bomb. You can wear them under blazers. You can change into them when your building’s air conditioning breaks and you’re sweating out of your clothes. Curly-haired friends: you can use the worn out ones to plop your hair — they make the best curl cloths!
Don’t print logo tees to hype up a business that doesn’t exist yet. They’re expensive. If you change your game or pivot early, they’re dead weight.
Blog posts are perfect for creating awareness and driving top-of-the-funnel metrics. Testimonial case studies help drive the bottom of the funnel metrics, converting the right people to sales qualified leads (SQLs). People like to do their research. If someone asks for a case study, you better have one ready to go.
Marketing automation can be a powerful piece of your go-to-market strategy. It’s fun to develop robust scoring and grading models. Imagine all of the personalized engagement campaigns, with their long and winding branches! *sigh*
If you don’t have bandwidth to fully implement marketing automation, don’t let your system gather dust. Start with a newsletter and some basic page and content tracking. Layer in landing pages and interaction-based email automations.
Delete records that don’t look like good fits as they come in — there’s no reason to hoard bad emails in your database. You’ll pay for them later when you hit your account limits.
Speaking of bad emails, be sure that your inbound forms require valid email addresses. If you sell to companies, validate to exclude free email domains. Yes — you’ll see less conversions, but you’ll know that your conversions are coming from potential customers.
Back in the day, marketing teams focused on moving people through the funnel. Along comes account-based marketing (ABM) and they “flipped the funnel.” #flipmyfunnel
The pyramid-shaped concept is enticing. It encourages teams to be more focused and effective with their marketing strategies. “Only sell to your ideal prospective customers.” It also over-simplifies what happens in B2B marketing and sales. If you work a set of identified ideal prospects with the goal of converting them and creating advocates, you really end up with something that looks more like a tunnel with a large pool at the bottom. And, it doesn’t account for the fact that new, unidentified prospects will continue to demand your product.
So, traditional marketing funnel? Or, account-based marketing? Good news! You can have both.
Stack your old funnel on top of your flipped funnel and make something that looks more like a Chemex.
Note: I am by no means the first person to have this idea. Here’s a blog post that was published in 2012 featuring a similar hourglass-shaped approach.
When a new support case comes in, a quick reply is a nice surprise that assures your customer that you saw their message and you’re looking into it. Customer support is tough and it’s easy to let things slip between the cracks. Users are more tolerant when they feel like you’re matching their urgency.
When I worked support by myself, I always had an unmanageable backlog but I watched my initial reply time. For a long time, my average initial reply time (including overnight hours) was less than 6 minutes. It was a nightmare for my boss, but my customers loved it. When we measured it, we had a 100% customer satisfaction (CSAT) rating. We had lots of customer quotes saying things like, “Wow! Thank you for the fast and friendly support.”
Yes — someone needs to follow through. If you don’t, people will write in creating more tickets to get answers to their unanswered questions which makes your backlog more unwieldy. But, with limited resources, if you have to choose between 100% completion rate on cases and quick replies, do quick replies first.
Note: an automatic robot message from your help desk is not a quick reply. It confirms that the message was delivered successfully and that’s great for UX, but it doesn’t instill any confidence that someone’s actually working on it right now. Use autoresponders if you have the right tools available, but don’t let those autoresponders count toward your initial reply time metrics.
Emojis and GIFs are swell. I definitely got better at my job when I learned to lighten up and take things less seriously in support. Unfortunately, practicing empathy is not as simple as, “Use more smiley faces and jokes.”
Truly empathetic support matches the tone and personality of a user. If the email feels very serious and thought-through, take the time to send a formal, complete reply. If someone sends you a winky face, send a goofy face back. If someone needs help removing Bad & Boujee from an email that went out to their whole company… you see where I’m going.
Note: this also works on phone calls and in sales meetings. Be yourself, but be able to adjust to meet tone of the person you’re talking to. In my natural state, I’m loud, easily excited, and I curse like a sailor. If I start talking with an engineer who’s a bit more subdued, I’ll slow down and copy their levels so we both feel more comfortable. It’s not insincere; it’s considerate.
Another note: if you’re looking for a crash course for how to offer great support, read this.
Notice that a customer is setting themselves up for a problem down the line? Don’t wait for customers to reach out with questions. Start the conversation early.
One of the most painful mistakes I made as a Client Success Manager was moving my help desk from Zendesk to Intercom. Several friends recommended Intercom. I loved the chat-email hybrid that seamlessly tied an in-app conversation to email. Their mobile app was fast and reliable. I was totally sold.
“This is so much better than being chained to a chat support widget.”
If you’re considering using Intercom for SaaS company support, you need to know that (as of right now in this moment, to the best of my knowledge) their system has:
All that to say — when choosing a support tool, consider the experience for your customers and your teammates. Map it out. Write it all down. Check the boxes and make sure it fits into your workflow.
Even your most engaged customers could churn due to reasons 100% outside of your control. Their company could go under. They could get acquired by a larger company with strict rules and incumbent tools. Don’t panic.
Once someone’s ready to cancel, make it easy. If you can, let customers cancel their accounts from within the application without requiring that they email someone about it. Offer a call to learn what went wrong and whether there’s a chance to reconnect in the future. Accept that not everyone will want to tell you the whole story. If you’re working hard to save a customer who wants to cancel, ask yourself “Why?” five times.
Disclaimer: I’m still getting better at this one. Do as I say, not as I do, y’all.
Bad quarters happen when you over-commit yourself to too many projects because you think they’re all equally important. Every morning, pick one thing that’s the most important task. Get it done before lunch.
Start every meeting with a round of “Here’s what I’m hoping to get out of this meeting…” Every meeting should end with next steps.
Startup Land is high energy 110%, 25 hours a day, 8 days a week. When you’re high on the hustle and the hype, it’s easy to get disconnected from reality and the people who operate on different frequencies. Get involved with your community. Spend face-to-face time with the family you choose.
Your personal happiness and fulfillment each day is more important than your performance or your goals. Take time off. Practice self-care. Cultivate sustainability in your lifestyle.
Our COO implemented StrengthsFinder tests for every employee at our company. By focusing on individual strengths and looking at how strengths are distributed across teams, you can solve major problems with communication. Encourage everyone to play to their strengths with projects that align with their natural abilities.
For the record, right now my top 5 strengths are:
This means that:
I love to come up with ideas to solve other people’s important problems strategically so that things can be better in the future.
Do what you will with that information.
My best 1:1 meetings looked like this:
If week-over-week that “what I need from you” is always the same, stop talking about it and take one step in the right direction to cross that thing off the list together. There’s no point spending time arguing or making excuses about why something’s not getting done. If you wait until the end of the quarter to review it, it’ll be too late to make it better.
Sometimes the hardest thing is knowing the first thing to do. Figure that out and move forward with positive intentions.
Punctuality doesn’t come easy to me. I have to work really hard to be on time. But, when you’re a manager it’s super important to be on time for your team. When you’re in any position of power, being late or consistently rearranging meetings comes across as passive aggressive. It’s a subtle indicator that you think your time is more important than your employee’s time, even if you genuinely don’t feel that way.
Set meetings. Show up early. Plan a buffer for things to run over. Proactively communicate if you need to reschedule. This is easy to say and hard to do. People who do this right come across as being respectful of others.
“A-players hire A-players and B-players hire C-players.” This phrase makes me cringe because it reminds me of sportsball and no one ever picked me first for kickball in middle school. I’ve spent way too much time wondering whether I’m even an “A-player” and trying to figure out what I can do to become one. Luckily, being an A-player isn’t about being the best employee; it’s about building the best team. Hire people who intimidate you. Hire people with the skills and potential that you don’t always see in yourself.
In a startup, it’s tempting to hire exclusively on referrals. If a friend or co-worker recommends someone, you know they’re vetted. It’s safer than hiring someone in off the street. A weird, unexpected side effect of this is that eventually we end up in a room surrounded by people who are just like us. They went to the same types of colleges. They’re in the same clubs outside of work. They have the same types of work experiences. They’ve been raised with the same ideas about what defines success.
We know that diversity of race, religion, gender, preference, identity, age, background, and experience drives better, more effective businesses. It’s not up for debate. Racially diverse companies outperform by 35%. Companies with women in leadership positions return 15% stronger profits.
So, go out of your way to work to attract candidates with diverse backgrounds. Let people know, “Diversity matters to me. We’re looking for people who are different.” Your silence is loud. If you’re not ready to say this or publish it on your careers page, ask yourself “Why?” five times.
If you do it twice, document it or automate it. Just don’t get so caught up in creating the process that you never actually do the thing.
Is our weekly all-hands still working? Are people still updating the intranet? Is our style guide up-to-date? Is our current vendor still cutting it? Evaluate your current processes. Adjust them to evolve with your team.
The people you need to build your company are not always the right people to take your company to the next level. Some individuals will be ready for the slowing pace and sharing of responsibility. They’ll settle into more specialized roles with sighs of relief. Others will feel paralyzed by new processes and required predictability. They won’t fit in your new molds without losing their limbs.
If keeping your early-stage employees on the team is a priority for you, make a point to carve out cross-functional leadership teams that aren’t exclusively for managers. Map out career paths that reward experience and preserve autonomy. Let people keep their seats at the table so they feel connected to the direction of the business that they helped build.
“That’s not possible!”
Yes, it is.
One strategy that I’ve seen work well at two super-successful Atlanta-based SaaS companies looks like this: move early-stage employees into new teams that act like small agencies within the larger organization. (This is similar to what giant companies do when they start innovation labs.)
For example, your first designer could become a creative director for special projects. Your first customer support agent could pilot a new partnerships team. Give old-school employees the freedom to be creative and develop management skills as you bring in outside talent to fill C-level and VP-level roles in the org chart.
Even if you do all the right things, the team around you will change over time. People need different things at different stages of their lives. Some people are just startup people. “Founders gotta found.”
Growing a SaaS startup from the ground up to the impossible is an incredible feat. They don’t teach this shit in schools. The experience is unmatched. It won’t fit on a resume or on a LinkedIn profile or even in a single blog post.
As beneficiaries and contributors within the startup community, we have an obligation to transfer our knowledge. We have a mandate to pay it forward and support emerging leaders.
While I hope you can take away something useful from this post and avoid some of the mistakes that I made, please know that fresh perspectives matter, too. I’m learning new things every day. This isn’t about what I learned — it’s about what we can learn from each other.

Be the first to respond.
Hi there, we’re Point Nine Capital a VC firm focused on SaaS and marketplaces. If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
In September 2016, Philippe Botteri from Accel released a landscape with 110 promising European SaaS companies including 9 portfolio companies from Point Nine. The list is based on some factors such as market attractiveness, traction and team for example. The goal of this landscape was not to provide a complete list but rather a comprehensive overview of several great SaaS companies in Europe.
In recent weeks I did an analysis of the landscape for Point Nine and dug deeper into the numbers. It’s striking me that those SaaS companies have been built in very different ways, which makes it impossible to lump them together or to derive successful patterns. Therefore, I’d like to point out some insights and additional comments which could be helpful for founders and some thoughts they might want to bear in mind when building a company.
Take into account though, that strategies and best practices from other companies are neither easy to replicate nor can one apply them to every company although you might share the same business model.
Please note: This analysis relies on the data from Crunchbase which might not be 100% accurate.
More than 30% of the SaaS companies mentioned in that landscape have their headquarters in the US now according to Crunchbase. The leading group among that 30% comes from Israel where ca. 60% companies have their headquarter in the US today.
If you look at the German SaaS companies from that landscape, it’s interesting to see that 67% of them have a US presence but not a single one flipped their HQ to the US (yet). Our French neighbors are similar though. Three of the 19 French companies — PeopleDoc, Algolia and Visiblee have their headquarter in the US now. However — and it’s important to mention — this analysis is based on small sample so it is very hard to judge how it looks across 1000 German or French SaaS companies but I would be very interested in that analysis in case you are working on that.
What does that mean for founders?
There are four companies in this landscape that each raised more than $100M so far: Intercom, NewVoiceMedia, Trustpilot and Zerto.
Until today, Trustpilot is the only company out of this relatively small sample where all the lead investors are based in Europe: Series C led by Draper Esprit, Series D lead by Vitruvian Partners. For the other three companies, US investors such as Iconiq Capital, Salesforce Ventures or Bessemer Venture Partners seem to be necessary — at least — to participate in those bigger rounds. This article here also points out some reasons why we see more growth rounds for EU startups led by US VCs in general, e.g. increased quality of European startups or EU countries as a better ground for some categories for new companies.
What does that mean for founders?
This is in particular interesting for seed funds such as Point Nine because there will be companies that simply skip the Seed and Series A, not giving us even the chance to invest :-)
In general, these companies can be described as businesses that bootstrap for a few years or raise a small angel round, and after a couple of years, they raise a big growth round of much more than $10M for internationalization and further growth. It is noteworthy that these companies are often Enterprise SaaS businesses and reach profitability fast which helps them to grow from their profits. Some examples:
What does that mean for founders?
Although these are exceptions among the 110 companies, there are 6 (5.5%) companies that never raised any money according to Crunchbase. If the data is correct, this shows that you can create a relatively big successful SaaS company without external money although the possibility is fairly low.
Notably, 5 of the 6 companies were founded before 2008 and the majority is offering software for analytics, sales or marketing purposes. I assume that the adoption of these tools is in general relatively fast and most of them are self-service tools such as Readdle or SessionCam.
What does that mean for founders?
Companies that focus too much on technology without putting it in the context of a customer problem will be caught between a rock and a hard place — or as I like to say, ‘between open source and a cloud place.
With more than 80%, the majority of the 110 companies are horizontal SaaS, their product is not tight to a specific industry and their customers operate in different industries.
Interestingly, most of the vertical SaaS companies are in the Retail (e.g. MetaPack, PeopleVox) and Healthcare industry (e.g. Docplanner, Patients know best).
What does this mean for founders?
In total, there are also some implications for VCs:
Also, there has been a lot of public debate about the future of SaaS recently, the growing dissonance between VC and SaaS companies, new moats, what comes after SaaS and that the next SaaS will look nothing like Salesforce. A good summary of all of that is also written here by ChartMogul.
70% of the software spend is still for on-premise Software, and even though VCs are rising the bar, there has never been a better time to start a SaaS company (in Europe).

Be the first to respond.
Nowadays, you can easily build a new business using a SaaS application and seize opportunities in new emerging markets. Various SaaS applications serve different purposes and for different kinds of users or target users.
To build a SaaS application, you need to have experience in software or web development or hire a software engineer, which can be very expensive. It is best to hire if the application is complex or if you don’t have the needed experience.
However, if you want to do it yourself, one way is learning how to code. This is a slow process. It takes months before you can even grasp concepts and build a basic app. The second option is to use no-code, low-code, or visual programming solutions.
If you are a developer and you want to get things done faster, you can also use low-code solutions, which will speed up the development process.
In every basic SaaS application, authentication and authorization are two key features that need to be available, especially if it’s a web application.
In most standard applications, users need to create an account and log in anytime they want to use it. This helps the application serve them better by saving their progress, keeping a record of everything carried out on the app, or customizing the app based on their profile, settings, and usage.
Let’s say our web application is a note-taking app. Users need to create an account and log in to save their notes and retrieve them anytime they need them.
To enable authentication on your application, users need to be able to create an account using a username/email and password. Then, authorization is required if you want to limit what a particular user can access.
User management is how administrators manage users on their platform — it gives them visibility of users on their platform. Managing users and their roles is very important in an application. Users should be able to access only what they are required to.
Having two types of users with different roles in an application helps you manage the different features and access each type of user needs.
To keep the services running and pay for the resources used in the application, you need to accept some form of payment.
There are many ways to add payments to your application. However, you will need to figure out which country your target users reside in and their method of payment — you need to integrate a payment gateway that can accept most payment methods for your target users.
There are tons of payment gateways these days, which makes it easier for you to integrate a payment system on your application and accept payments easily. Some gateways make it easier by providing Checkout UI, Payment SDK, and payment buttons to make the process easier.
When building a SaaS application that deals with a lot of asynchronous data from different external services, you need to find a way to listen and react when something happens in the system.
Webhooks and events allow you to listen to all the events in the system and react to them. For example, let’s say we want to be able to generate custom invoices for user payments. We’ll need to listen to Stripe events to know when the user pays and generate a custom invoice for the user.
Once the invoice is generated, we’ll want to be notified of this and automate sending the invoice to their email.
To manage your application users, payments, and subscriptions, you will need an admin panel. With your admin access, you need to be able to:
This will give you better insight into who your users are and how they are using your platform.
Your admin panel can have features to give discounts/bonuses to users, refund users, manage payments, and so on.
So far, we have looked at some basic SaaS features. Now let’s look at their solutions.
Frontegg is a user management platform that lets you embed a drop-in authentication, authorization, user, and role management at a go. And you don’t have to write any code. It provides all the building blocks to add authentication and user management to your application. It gives you the self-service admin experience with a multi-tenant feature to manage all your users, their roles and permissions, payments, and subscriptions in different applications.
Out of the box, Frontegg will let you set pricing for your users. Your users can choose subscription plans, change plans, and automate renewal. Frontegg provides a way to listen to all the events happening in your system. The best advantage of Frontegg is you don’t need to write any code to implement it. You can just embed it in your admin interface — you can also get started for free to test their most popular features at a smaller scale.
Zapier is an automation platform that lets you create zaps with webhooks and react to the incoming data payload. With Zapier, you can handle the whole application background operations using its large arrays of integrations. This includes the database, emails, HTTP requests, and so on.
It is a very useful product if your app involves some automation in dynamic forms, payments, and subscriptions. If your app interacts with lots of external services that have already been integrated with Zapier, you can easily use Zapier to communicate.
Auth0 is simply an authentication and authorization platform that can be added to any application to enable auth services. It provides the building blocks for developers to build on authentication services into their applications. With Auth0, you still need to perform a significant amount of coding to make it work seamlessly in your application. Therefore, it is ideal for developers who don’t want to waste time building auth from scratch.
Retool is a simple drag and drop platform that helps you build internal tools and dynamic dashboards and connect them to your databases, APIs, and other services like Google Cloud Platforms services. Retool also lets you write custom SQL queries and Javascript so you can interact with data and handle the app interactions.
With Retool, you can build a custom dashboard that shows all your users in your database and lets you update your users’ roles directly from the dashboard. However, you still need to write some code at the frontend app to handle the app interaction. You will also need to design the app and connect it to the database using the UI toolkit.
Stripe provides you with out-of-the-box tools to easily accept payments on your application and customize the checkout UI and payment button without writing a single line of code. So if you are not a developer, you can still integrate Stripe on your application by just embedding the payment buttons and checkout on your application.
Stripe also lets you manage your user subscriptions. If you are offering a subscription pricing model, you can use Stripe to easily manage all your users’ subscriptions and give access to the right people.
Stripe also lets you create coupon codes so you can give discounts to your users anytime.
I wish we could explore more solutions as there are tons of low-code solutions that provide various benefits. Your choice of solution should depend on your usage — what works best for you and lets you achieve your app goals.

最近有機會和新創團隊聊到，即使他們還是小團隊，明明公司同仁都在 Line/Facebook 上，這樣溝通比較有「效率」，為什麼我還會建議需要為工作與私人使用選擇不同的溝通工具，還需要用 Slack 呢？
在新創環境，應已不少朋友可體會 Slack 等工作用途工具的優點及公私分明的必要，我還是想贅述一下，我認為即使團隊還在草創階段，都可以開始採用。
我是認為「效率」有時候不見得是指當下溝通的速度，而是建立一個工作流程和系統時，當窗口換人時，都能在軌道上維持溝通。

如果平常在 line/messenger 覺得知道對方「已讀」功能很重要的話，可試試 Email CRM integration 的系統。我使用過這兩個 Email integration 的 gmail chrome extension，(Hubspot 就是暢銷書「獨角獸與牠的產地」作者待的那家公司)，這類服務有幾個基本功能：
視訊開會：Zoom、Google Hangout、Skype
這一年遇到需要 con-call 的機會，幾乎都改成使用 Zoom。
工作管理：Trello
工作上我只用過 Trello，個人的 To-do List 之前用 Any.do，最近改用 Todoist。
傳送重要檔案：DocSend、Caplinked
DocSend 是我滿推薦的，也有滿多 startups 用 DocSend 送 pitch deck 給投資人，檔案送出後，能像 web analytics 般追蹤與分析文件被誰開啟、在某一頁看了多久，另外可以做版本控制，不用擔心收件人看到舊版檔案，也可以依據不同收件人需求，給出不同的連結，也可以抓到檔案的流向。
如果更重要的檔案，好比投資合約，需要控管更細的使用者權限和版本，Caplinked 是更 secured 的 virtual data room，可以做到更細的追蹤與分析。
電子簽章：DocuSign、HelloSign
比較常被 assign 用HelloSign，就如一般電子簽章服務，可以設定要給誰簽，單向、雙向或多向，及簽名順序.. 等。
客服系統：Intercom
我使用的時間不長，這個在多人同時維護一個公司客服帳戶時很好，可以內部自行加上附註，assign 窗口，不會重複回覆。
OKR Management: 15Five
這個我用的時間也不長，使用時覺得是個很輕巧的系統，可以跟公司回報自己想法和目標。
Storage: Dropbox、Google Suite (Google Drive)、Box
Storage 大家比較熟悉了。
費用管理：Expensify
各種要報公帳的發票收據，app 拍照就可以做好報帳。
www.ragic.com
雖然以上寫了好多國外的服務，但偶爾提到以上的服務，會覺得新創圈的朋友未必熟悉或使用過這些服務。
所以想在最後特別一提台灣的 Saas 廠商 — — Ragic!
他們公司就是一個提供很多工作營運相關的 Saas 服務，而且國內外客戶非常多。他們主推的功能是線上資料庫表單系統，不過許多上面提到的 CRM、Email integration、簽核系統、客服系統、行事曆整合，Ragic 都有提供對應服務。推薦！

https://medium.com/design-of-a-technology-business/how-to-apply-to-a-content-position-in-the-saas-industry-2c750a29c998?source=search_post---------224,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
I tend to think content managers are the smartest people in the world. And I’m not saying that because I am one — I know I tend to brag, but not so obviously. Content managers gather, in one brain, five different kinds of “smart” at the same time:
Pretty impressive, right? Yet among all those smart cookies, SaaS companies are still claiming they want only the best of the best. I have applied to content jobs myself, and then hired content people; I’d love to share some thoughts with you about that.
I want to start with an example: me. I’m a pretty average person, therefore, I guess most people can identify with my situation. I also like to reach for the stars — as do many people in the SaaS industry: the ecosystem is at the same time promising, fascinating and highly challenging.
Lars Lofgren recently announced he’s recruiting copywriters for Kissmetrics’ blog, i.e, the Rolls Royce of SaaS blogs. Let’s say I want to apply.
I have been a content manager for only 5 months. Before that, I was a freelance copywriter, and before that, a marketing manager. Therefore I know a thing or two about content, but I am definitely no expert. Here’s how I would introduce myself.
Note: this is a fictional application. I actually have a lovely job at eFounders in Paris! This is merely my way to participate in the beautiful content ecosystem.
I hope Lars will take time to review this fake application to help you all.
Rules to apply were clear: “send a resume, why you wanna work here, your best piece of content, and your Linkedin profile”. It seems pretty clear to me that a short email won’t do it for Lars, so I did slides. It could have been a podcast, a Youtube video, an infographics, or a Bunkr presentation: something “content-y” that show you’ve got other things to show in the future.
I didn’t put as much effort in theses slides as if I actually applied, of course. They’re here to give you an idea.
2. Show you love the product
SaaS is a particular industry in the sense that, although it’s B2B, it has a lot of B2C in it. I find a lot more emotion in SaaS communications and content marketing than in any other B2B products. You loving the product should be a strong motivation, and it should show in your application.
Here, I’m using Kissmetrics’ visual identity in the slides — that is not a super-original idea, but it’s better than a simple letter, right? I’m also telling the story of how I got to know the product. The story is actually true, but if you don’t have any particular anecdote to tell, remember: no one’s here to check (just saying).
3. Focus on your assets
I’m no Content super-star — yet. Therefore, I had to show my best asset: I learn fast and I like to learn a lot. I opted for an “illustrated example” of what I did wrong, better, somehow good, and what I hoped to learn in the future.
Note that the slides do not include ‘I’m no content superstar’: they don’t need to know that. They are the ones who need to focus on your qualities.
For instance, in my application, I use the example of an article I made. I do not mention the Podcast I made out of the article, which was a HUGE fail.
4. It’s also the little things…
You have to show you’ll fit instantly to the company. If you can, mention if you ever met someone from the inside. If you’ve heard of a company culture skydiving tradition, tell them you love to skydive.
Or like me, in your personal info, show that you hang around on the same social networks as them, GrowthHackers, Quibb, and so on (I didn’t add Hacker News because I have such a poor karma!)
Express your inside Shakespeare.
Send links to content you’re proud of, it’s the first thing your future employer will look at.
I’ve scanned applicants who told me “I love copywriting! But, no, I have nothing to show you online”… Come on.
Prove your data-driven mindset
Content marketers and SaaS copywriters are, above all, marketers. In any case, if you apply to a position in a marketing department, you have to show you love data.
Show you have an eye for design and data visualization
You don’t need to be a designer yourself, you mainly need to have an eye for good design and ability to tell a story with visuals — you will probably work along with designers that you’ll need to brief.
There are great chances you’ll work on data visualization (which is a very fascinating and complicated art!): send links to infographics you made / you love, to show you care.
Demonstrate your customer-love
Customers are the heart and soul of a SaaS company, you must love them already. Even before you apply.
Manifest your ROI-mindset
Nothing speaks better than figures. Back your application with data showing your content gets results. In other words, prove you can not only master words but also lead generation.
To dig a little deeper, show your ROI is smart: each product has a different strategy, show you can analyse your data in various ways.
I’m always looking to meet / talk to interesting people, especially if you’re a good SaaS copywriter / PR person / social media expert, for current or future positions at eFounders (remote OK). If it’s you, email me at rachel@efounders.co
UPDATE:
The position at Mention mentioned (lol) below is no longer up to date. Yet, I know another great SaaS company looking for an Inbound marketer in Paris: Mailjet (ok, you might need to speak French for that).
I’ll keep you updated with any other job offers in our network!
OUTDATED: For a current position, I strongly recommend you check out Mention, my favorite media monitoring tool ever ever. They are looking for Content Marketers in Paris & NYC, a.k.a the best two cities in the world. Apply here.
PS: yes, I pretty much wrote this blogpost just to take the opportunity to share with you these job openings. But you knew it already, didn’t ya?

Jun 24, 2019·10 min read
A little over two years ago I wrote a blog piece on Early Stage SaaS Unit Economics which outlines LTV/CAC for enterprise software businesses. While heavy on math, the post lacked foresight because I now believe LTV/CAC calculations are of waning importance in SaaS. It is clear to the SaaS community that the future of selling software is bottoms-up. Great examples of this today are Twilio, Shopify, Dropbox, Zoom, Slack, Square and Atlassian. A confluence of factors led to this including rapid product development and deployment via AWS, and now simply an expectation of buyers to purchase software this way.
Due to the change in selling and retention motions inherent in these models, the market has come to believe that the best way to analyze these businesses is on a cohort gross margin payback basis and not LTV/CAC. The challenge with LTV/CAC is that it’s too static of a formula to analyze businesses that are now dynamic across cohorts on all of the important SaaS metrics and variables (ARR, CAC, churn, up-sell, etc).
Let me first describe the traditional and new SaaS business models side-by-side, as the nuance between them helps to explain why the way we analyze SaaS businesses is changing.
The traditional SaaS business model is relatively static across the two primary variables that are captured in the LTV/CAC analysis. The go-to-market cost is captured in CAC, and the resulting gross margin lifetime schedule (a derivative of ARR) is captured in LTV. As outlined in my original post referenced above, you generally want this formula to produce a number larger than 3x. As mentioned in my prior post, I generally use 4–5 years as a customer lifetime assumption for an enterprise business (SMB is ~3 years). This means that in dissecting this formula you’d expect a customer to produce cumulative gross margin of at least 3x CAC in a 4–5 year period. Month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter, you generally don’t see that 3x LTV/CAC number bouncing around too much in legacy SaaS businesses, although you obviously want to see steady improvements over time.
The reason for this is that the traditional enterprise SaaS model employs a relatively rigid sales machine, with a relatively rigid cost structure — a marketing automation strategy sends MQLs from the top of the funnel to a team of BDRs and AEs who turn MQLs to SQLs and then hopefully paying customers. In general, you do not see legacy enterprise software deals closed without customers touching the sales team and that’s in large part because the products weren’t built to sell themselves. Legacy products are more complex in nature and require an on-boarding effort with the customer success team. Because of this structure, you generally don’t see a dramatic variance in CAC due to the fixed cost and process. On the other end of the equation looking at LTV, traditional enterprise deals are sold in annual increments. At the one-year mark, the contract either churns, down-sells or up-sells; you won’t usually see a change in the middle of the contract or a dramatic movement with the down/up-sells. Given this dynamic, once a SaaS business has a good sense of the total CAC cost, they will disqualify customers falling in an ACV band that produces an LTV of less than 3x (there is sometimes an exception here if you sell into one division of a very large org and you believe you can up-sell across the entire company over time). You’ll frequently hear legacy software founders say, “we do not sell to customers below $X thousand in ACV because they’re not profitable”. This is the consequence of having a static CAC and a product that generates a relatively static ACV and won’t drastically change in the middle or end of contract.
Now let’s switch gears to bottoms-up SaaS models such as Atlassian and Square. Starting with GTM where there is no longer a fully staffed sales team converting MQLs to SQLs and close by navigating the large organizations they’re trying to sell into. These SaaS products are designed to be sold through a website and/or inside of the core product where software can be deployed on a self-serve basis. Given this dynamic, the key GTM priorities are filling top of funnel with high quality users and iterating on landing pages + product so that conversions are optimized (much like a consumer business). Given this dynamic, bottoms-up SaaS products are now available to a wider range of customers from consumer to SMB and very large enterprise (Box and Dropbox are great examples of this). As such, the bottoms-up revenue models differ substantially from legacy enterprise software vendors.
There are two primary approaches to pricing a bottoms-up model: volume-based pricing and module-based pricing. With volume-based pricing, your ARR increases period-to-period based on how much a customer is consuming (either by seats or usage). Atlassian’s Confluence (screenshot above) is a great example of this as they charge per seat with price breaks on volume. As your team size increases or decreases each month, so does your monthly payment to Atlassian.
On the other hand, module-based pricing presents customers with additional modules that they can add onto their contract. Square’s module (& volume) based pricing can be found here. In any given month, customers can consume many different products (analytics, invoices, gift cards, etc) and at various volumes for each of those (invoices, gift cards, employee mgmt.). The result is that month-to-month gross margin (& the resulting LTV) is highly variable depending on how each individual customer performs.
Regardless of the approach between volume and module-based pricing, the key differences are; 1) the software is not sold by quota carrying BDRs and AEs, it’s sold through a beautiful website and product built with the intention of up-selling and cross-selling users and 2) the size of your customer contracts can range from very small to very large.
Given these changes to GTM motions and ARR schedules, what does this do to our LTV/CAC analysis? At its highest level, BDRs and AEs are replaced with Product Marketers, and annual revenue (and the resulting gross margin) is highly variable depending on how much churn, up-sell and down-sell happen month-to-month. The correct primary framework now becomes time to gross margin payback on a cohort basis. There are many ways to cut this data, but the two most important outputs are; rolling MRR by cohort, and total time to payback by cohort. You can find the complete analysis with a number of additional tables here.
The first table above is simple. It is monthly revenue over time by cohort. A great bottoms-up SaaS business will consistently have monthly revenue that is greater than the first month of the cohort illustrating a situation where up-sell is greater than down-sell and churn. There will be bad months, and bad cohorts, but the hope is that over time, on average, the business grows on a cohort basis. You’ll notice above that the Feb 2018 cohort was in constant decline; it started in Period 1 with $23,679 in monthly revenue, and ended in Period 17 with $445 in monthly revenue. On the other hand, the June 2018 cohort started with $27,381 in monthly revenue, and ended Period 13 with $165,057 in monthly revenue.
The second table above shows the total payback of the cohort relative to the entire sales and marketing spend from the month prior. In this example, I am assuming that there is a one month sales cycle for this business as is common for bottoms-up models. For example, for all of the customers that were acquired in the Feb 2018 cohort ($23,679 in monthly revenue), we are assuming that 100% of them were acquired with the prior months S&M spend which is $142,569 in this example. There are of course nuances here as out-of-home and other brand advertising techniques have long tail effects and you’ll need to amortize that spend over multiple periods when you run the analysis. Next, we apply the gross margin % (80% in this example) to that $23,679 monthly revenue to model out the monthly profit each cohort is providing to the business (Table 4 in the excel). Then, we simply take the cumulative gross margin by period to determine exactly when the business has paid back all of its sales & marketing expenses (CAC). In the second table right above here you’ll see that the March 2018 cohort had paid back 100% of its CAC (1.12 to be exact) by Period 12. By Period 16, that single cohort had paid back its CAC 1.43x over. The May 2018 cohort was even stronger having paid back its CAC 3.54x by Period 14 (a phenomenal cohort!).
In looking at these payback metrics you start to see why the LTV/CAC framework simply does not work with modern bottoms-up SaaS companies. The lifetime value of a customer can vary dramatically simply because the ACV range of possibilities is much higher given the pricing models above. Additionally, given the self serve nature of the product, CAC can range from very small, to very large. Imagine the scenario where someone from Walmart Corporate sees a single ad online, signs up for the product and then invites everyone on their team. Or the inverse where someone at a 10 person startup had to click on your ads for an entire year before converting. To illustrate this point, you’ll see that in Period 6 the cohort payback ranges from 0.26 to 1.37, and in Period 12, 0.57x to 3.03x; vastly different cohort compositions. Also note that it’s cohort payback and not customer LTV/CAC. In each of these cohorts, there are many customers that churned in early periods and on an individual basis were not profitable (poor LTV/CAC). That is ok as long as there are other customers in the cohort that expand over time.
This ability to expand is absolutely crucial to making these business models work given that consumer and SMB customers have a much higher propensity to churn relative to the enterprise users acquired in the same cohort. Additionally, the very nature and ease of on-boarding with new SaaS products means that it’s also much easier for a customer to churn and onboard with a new competitor. If you’re going to allow month-to-month contracts with low friction on-boarding (and churn!), you must have a product that lends itself to rapid growth either via volume or modules. Without large expansion potential your SaaS business is DOA.
The rule of thumb with legacy SaaS businesses is that you want to aim for an LTV/CAC of greater than 3x. Rules of thumb for bottoms-up businesses are dangerous because of the cohort composition ranging from consumer to SMB and enterprise. If you have 100% consumer in your cohort you better get paid back quickly because churn is high, and if the cohort has a majority of sticky enterprises then you may have more time.
One thing that is a constant in every business type regardless of model is payback. It still remains true that you always want to payback your acquisition cost within the first 12–18 months (shorter end for SMB, longer for enterprise). Additionally, you can keep it simple and say that the 3x target referenced in my original post remains the same. But, instead of LTV/CAC, that is now the minimum target cumulative cohort payback within the first 3.5 years. If your cohort composition skews more consumer and SMB, that number should be closer to 3 years, and for pure enterprise it can be extended towards 4. But again, by definition these cohorts will generally include all customer types, so 3.5 years is a good assumption.
Best in class public SaaS companies are operating well above 100% net revenue retention which is directly correlated to CAC payback. If you take care of that along with healthy gross margins, the payback will follow. You’ll see below that investors are placing a huge premium on businesses with this type of retention behavior. Unsurprisingly, Twilio, a company that has mastered both volume and module based pricing (see here) is leading the way with 145% net $ retention.
And better yet, they’re doing it with industry leading sales and marketing efficiency (notice another bottoms-up model is beating them in Atlassian).
At the end of the day, LTV/CAC and cohort payback methodologies are both determinants of cash flow health. If you remember the golden rule of financial analysis, everything else will take care of itself.
“Balance sheets and income statements are fiction, cash flow is reality”.
A few post scripts…
For the sake of outlining this analysis, I assumed this SaaS business GTM was 100% bottoms-up. In most cases, the best thing to do is complement the bottoms-up GTM with a traditional sales team for the larger and more complex logos. Ultimately this complicates the org (distinct customer success, website messaging, support, etc), and obviously the analysis, but this should be your north star.
I have long been arguing that at least a portion of the Product Marketing salaries should be included in CAC for bottoms-up models. This is simply a reallocation of legacy S&M spend, to product marketers for the explicit goal of driving more revenue and less churn. Founders and investors are not talking about this nearly enough today but I think it’ll be commonplace once bottoms-up GTM is truly the norm.

Here are the big questions I’d like to answer in this post:
Note: if you’d rather listen, there’s an audio version of this blog post here:
simplecast.com
I was born in the 1980s. First computer: Commodore Vic-20. Second computer: Tandy 1000. Third computer: 386 PC clone. Fourth: Pentium clone.
My first software purchase was sending $44 to Apogee Software for a game called Commander Keen. In 1991 you could download Keen from a BBS, or buy it in a box from a retailer.
For most of the ’90s, most software was distributed this way. You’d buy it, and install it on your desktop. The popular business applications were Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop. Companies would spend hundreds of dollars to license software like Office for each employee’s machine.
In 1999 a software company called Salesforce launched. They were using a new licensing and distribution model: Software as a Service (SaaS). Instead of buying individual licenses, you paid a monthly fee for each user. The software wasn’t installed on employees’ machines; it was hosted centrally on a web server.
Five years later 37signals famously launched Basecamp. Their launch was different for a number of reasons. First: Jason Fried and DHH had built their web application with no funding. Second: they’d created a framework on top of the Ruby language that made web app development faster. They called it “Ruby on Rails.” They open-sourced it in 2004, which allowed anyone in the world to build web apps on the framework.
This is where the pendulum began to swing.
If you were a software developer pre-2004 you were likely building applications for desktops or servers. Post-2004, this began to change. Developers loved the flexibility and philosophy behind Rails. And business people saw the potential for building revenue generating products on the SaaS model. The other convergence was the increase in internet speeds. High-speed internet became more common, making web-based software more realistic.
Seeing the success of products like Basecamp, there was a rapid increase in the number of web applications. And, for distribution and pricing, they used the SaaS model. Users paid a recurring fee (usually monthly) to access the application via their web browser.
In 2007, Ryan Carson started doing the Future of Web Apps conferences. Thousands of developers and aspiring founders flocked to these events in the USA and Europe.
Many of the SaaS companies we recognize today were launched during this time. Freshbooks was launched in 2006. Zendesk was founded in 2007. Wufoo started in 2006. Xero Accounting was created in 2006 as well.
Now? The number of SaaS-based companies has grown from a few hundred to tens of thousands. AngelList alone lists 10,000 SaaS startups.
Like any gold rush, there’s been winners and losers.
I don’t know. My friend Ruben Gamez says there is tons of upside left. He’s way smarter than I am, and he’s probably right.
If you look at the research by Bessemer, the enterprise is spending more on SaaS:
The enterprise market is tricky, though. They’ve increased spending on SaaS 17.6% since 2013, but only decreased spending on traditional software by 2.8%. Are they replacing on-premise solutions with SaaS? Or are they paying for new services they weren’t using before? Will the trend continue? Hard to know for sure.
The other question when looking at stats from the enterprise space is who is benefiting from all that growth. Is it the small five-person SaaS company? Or is Salesforce, who have about 20% of the CRM market, and keep growing by about 21% each year.
The small business market is even harder to discern. In Intuit’s study, the average SMB spent $630 / year on software. In the old days, that might have meant upgrading to a new version of Microsoft Office. Now? $52.50 per month is a very small pie for dozens of different SaaS companies to compete for.
Nobody really knows when the market for SaaS will become saturated:
“The question remains — at what point does web-based software stop taking market share? Most forecasters agree that it will become the majority at some point. Will that be 51%, 67% or 85%? Only time will tell.”
– Michael Ortner, Capterra
In some categories, like CRM, we’re already past 51% market share for SaaS. Will it keep growing?
Using something like Amazon Web Services, you can get started for pennies, and scale your usage as your business grows. Web development frameworks have gotten better. UI frameworks have made good design more accessible. Services like Stripe make accepting payments easier.
So yes, it’s cheaper to start a SaaS. My buddy Marty and I recently did this. We bought a domain, got a free hosting credit on Digital Ocean, and fired up a web app in a day. Cheap and easy.
However, growing a business has always been hard. And there are certain times in history where growing a particular type of business is harder (just ask Microsoft).
Mattermark’s update from June 2016 proclaimed:
It’s getting more expensive to build SaaS companies and exits are weak.
I think Rob Walling articulates the challenge well:
We’re not building these basic CRUD apps like we used to be able to. The stuff’s too competitive now.
Think of a project management tool, time tracking, or invoicing software. There’s a lot that goes into building the product; but on the back-end the performance implications of it are really small compared to something that is sending a lot of email, or doing a lot of analytics, tracking opens, tracking clicks.
Both of our apps do that. I can’t even imagine what apps, like Mixpanel and Kissmetrics have to do on the back-end because they are the next level. Now I understand why those types of businesses had to raise funding. You just couldn’t get enough boxes and enough people to scale that up without having a big outlay in advance, even with a tool like Amazon EC2 or Rackspace Cloud.
In many ways, those first CRUD-based SaaS products (address books, time tracking, invoicing) were the low hanging fruit. The opportunity to be first in those segments has passed.
“Technology markets tend to be winner-take-all, the leaders in any given category will get an unfair share of the overall economic pie.”
– Scott Kupor, Preethi Kasireddy, Andreessen Horowitz
Sure!
Just remember: “SaaS” isn’t a destination. It’s just a licensing and delivery model. Don’t treat it like a religion!
Founders have different goals. If you’re venture-backed, you want a big exit or great dividends. If you’re a self-funded solo-founder you might just want a $100,000 / year paycheque.
My warning is that regardless of your goal, the SaaS model has weaknesses and threats. Many founders choose SaaS just because you want the recurring revenue. Or they might like the simplicity of being able to deploy to one server (as opposed to issuing an update for thousands of clients).
But just because you like the model as a founder, doesn’t mean it’s the right model for your customers, your product, your niche, or the current market conditions!
Also: SaaS might not be a good fit for you as a founder. The idea of being a “solopreneur” and running a SaaS is mostly a myth (there’s an exception, see the bottom of this post). Almost all the SaaS companies I know with more 7 figures in revenue have a team . Most SaaS companies need a lot of cash at the beginning to sustain them through the first 24 months. If you don’t want to run a team, and you don’t want to invest a bunch of cash up-front, SaaS probably isn’t for you.
In the old days, the mantra from bootstrappers was: “we won’t sell our companies!” But in recent years, we’ve seen many self-funded SaaS companies sell (Drip, Simply Accounting, Campaign Monitor taking PE). It seems like the payoff for most founders (regardless of funding) is the exit:
“I don’t say, ‘You should always bootstrap. You should never take funding. You should never sell your company.’ People get the vision of this founder who just goes and starts this and they’re just all about not selling their company. They look at Mark Zuckerberg and Basecamp. There are very few companies like that.”
– Rob Walling
Business models are fallible. They can be disrupted. Customers buy SaaS as long as it suits them. If there’s a model that saves them more time and money, they’ll use that instead.
When the pendulum swings too far to one side, there’s opportunity to do something in the other direction.
Every model has threats:
If everyone else is focused on the SaaS model, they might be missing an opportunity. There could be alternatives to SaaS that customers want right now!
“Businesses don’t care about SaaS vs desktop. It’s just cost and value” — Michael Buckbee
Here are some opportunities I’m seeing.
In 2013, Adobe changed their entire business model. Instead of selling boxed version of their Creative Suite, they moved everything to the cloud. Now, if you want the newest version of Photoshop, you have to pay monthly for it.
There were a lot of users who didn’t like this model. They wanted to pay once for a version of the software. If a new version came out, they could decide to upgrade, or just keep using the old version.
This became an opportunity for the makers of Sketch, a $99 design application. Users pay once, and get free updates for a year. If they wish to continue getting updates, they can renew.
I feel like there are a lot of desktop apps masquerading as SaaS products. What I mean is they’ve fit their software into a SaaS model but really it would be better served by a traditional application model. Adobe Photoshop, in my mind, is a good example.
In certain customer segments, particularly SMBs, I’m seeing “SaaS payment fatigue.” There’s an opportunity to give these customers what they want: pay up-front, and only upgrade when they need it.
A lot of the value in SaaS has traditionally been in the centralized web hosting they provide customers.
But what if customers were able to buy the web application and host it on Amazon Web Services themselves? They could buy the software once, and deploy it to servers they control.
In most web apps the application layer and the database layer are separate. If the creator of the software released a new version, the customer could then purchase that upgrade, and deploy it themselves.
If you’ve ever used the “Deploy to Heroku” button on GitHub, you know how much easier these types of deployments have become.
And don’t discount the threat of open source here. There have always been open source alternatives to popular SaaS products. Up until now, there’s been barriers to use (mostly, installation, updates, and licensing) but those could be solved.
As an example, Apostello is open source software for churches. The homepage features one-click installation for Heroku or Digital Ocean. I’ve tried it. It’s simple to setup. The documentation is superb. Instead of paying $49 / month for a similar service, they could host for as little as $5 / month (plus Twilio costs).
Security, upgrades, maintenance and customer support have always been a concern with self-hosted setups. However, Infrastructure as a Service providers have a tremendous opportunity to step-up here. Heroku, for example, could come to me and say: “Justin, you’re paying $300 / month for these 5 SaaS products, why not just come over to our platform, and self-host similar apps for $100 / month?”
There have always been companies who have offered self-hosted options (JIRA and HelpSpot). What’s new is how easy these apps are to deploy and maintain, and how accessible and cheap the cloud has become.
Claire Lew is CEO of a two-person software company called Know Your Company. It’s a web application with an unusual pricing model. Claire outlines it here:
We charge $100 per employee, one-time, for life. That’s it. So if you’ve got 20 employees, it’s $2,000. You pay that once and that’s it. No recurring costs, maintenance fees, etc. The only time you ever pay again is if you hire someone new. Then it’s $100 for that new person.
Since they launched two years ago, they’ve been profitable. They have margins of 30%.
What I love about Claire’s strategy is she’s aligned her business model with her customer’s use case:
I believe that a business owner should get feedback from an employee for the entire time that she or he is at the company. Not just for a few weeks or months? — ?but for how ever many years an employee is with you. A subscription model doesn’t encourage this. It’s easy to go for a few months using a product, paying, say, $50 a month, and then turn it off.
There’s been a fragmentation in software delivery. In the last 10 years, companies have increased the number of different software products they buy by 10x.
I have a one person company (it’s just me). Here are all the SaaS products I use:
If you look at that list, you’ll see there’s opportunity for consolidation . Some applications could add new features, and become the one-stop-shop.
Nathan Kontny, for example, just added bulk email sending to Highrise CRM. For some clients, that might mean not needing to spend money on MailChimp.
Basecamp just integrated group chat right into their project management software.
SMBs especially feel like they are using, and paying, for too many apps. You can only pay $29 per month for so many apps. Eventually small businesses will ask: what do I absolutely need, and what can I get rid of? Or, put another way, how can I save money and save time?
Earlier I said that building a SaaS as a solo-founder is mostly a myth. Eventually, you need to hire to build faster, compete, and support customers.
However, there is an outlier: solopreneurs who have built a profitable “micro SaaS” on top of bigger platforms. Here are some examples:
SaaS is just a model for licensing and delivering software. It’s not a business panacea.
Since 2008 I’ve worked exclusively for SaaS companies. I have equity in SaaS companies. I can tell you: it’s hard. It’s way harder than some other business models.
SaaS isn’t right for every product. It’s not the best solution for every customer.
The question I wanted to ask in this post is: “how could it be disrupted?”
Cheers,Justin Jackson

Last week during SaasBiz event that we co-hosted with Count.ly, I gave a presentation on Frameworks Governing SaaS to help entrepreneurs navigate during big shifts happening in SaaS like new go-to-market approaches, changing funnel processes with authentic examples from successful entrepreneurs.
The presentation deck can be found at the bottom, but below is a summary of the primary takeaways.
Big shifts happening in Saas;
It has never been cheaper to build a SaaS company. With the rising number of companies providing every tool, you need to build your own SaaS tool, like open-source software packages instead of paid developer tools and AWS instead of your own datacenter, just to name a few. We are living at a time that a tech blog like Hacker Noon can explain how you can build your own SaaS tool with $0 in a blog post that you can read in less than 20 minutes.
The barrier to entry to the market being low is essentially a marvelous advantage for entrepreneurs who are building their own SaaS company. However, it comes with a downside.
On a recent blog post, Andrew Chen from Andreessen Horowitz argues that “startups are cheaper to build, but more expensive to grow” and compares the cost of different customer acquisition channels with their prior values. Results are in line with his argument.
Furthermore, despite the increasing acquisition costs customers’ willingness to pay for a feature has dropped by 30% during the same time period.
The second shift is about the buying decision. Now, it is made before the customer reaches out to the vendor. This is probably the most talked shift. However, there is a misconception about this only being applicable to B2C companies. According to Forrester, three out of every four B2B buyers want to self-educate rather than listening to the sales representatives talk about their products and services.
Hence, the products that give the option to try the product out before buying through a free trial or freemium model have less friction and lead to a higher conversion rate.
With increasing competition and customer acquisition costs companies are forced to lower their prices to compete. However, to compensate for the loss in profits, they aim to reach the masses. This, on the other hand, caused major changes in products and resulted in user experience becoming a fundamental part of the purchasing process. Nowadays, your product needs to check multiple boxes before you can sell it. Your product needs to be able to tell about itself, educate the user on its how-to’s, onboard the user, and lastly show what it is capable of to turn a free user into a customer. Charging $5 or $10 per user is not enough to create the user traffic needed to create potential customers via engagement. Those days are long gone. Users want to use the product free before they make their purchase, making the experience your product can offer the most crucial aspect of turning a user into a customer. It would be fair to say that providing users with stellar product experiences are not a luxury anymore, it is a necessity.
Slack is able to convert 30% of their freemium users to paid without even a single person engaging with the customer. This can easily demonstrate the power of a strong product.
Since we acknowledged the shifts that are currently affecting the SaaS environment, we can now think about how we should guide the scaling processes in regards to the present market settings. As ScaleX, we examine growth in three main stages. The process of growth starts with finding a product/market fit. Creating a product that could satisfy its market is naturally in the first stage of a successful venture. Then, we look for a repeatable, scalable and profitable growth model. Lastly, we move on to scaling the business.
Not many entrepreneurs understand these stages well. According to the Startup Genome Project that covers premature scaling based on data from over 3200 high growth technology startups, 70% of startups scale too early. Furthermore, they go in-depth with their report and conclude that premature scaling could explain 90% of the failed startups. It is also the biggest mistake we see in the early-stage startups we encounter and analyze. They are thinking too long term for their size and go for scaling from the beginning. At such an early, your main focus has to be on creating a product that will satisfy your customer. This requires understanding your customer and their problem. The best way to do that is to listen and get in their mind. As Paul Graham says;
“Do things that don’t scale. “
Let’s be real, this is not the first time that you heard anyone say that, “First, you should find product/market fit”. However, there is a reason why it has been repeated year after year. It is an obscure concept to grasp and use correctly.
There are various ways to classify different SaaS companies, in this case, we would like to examine the connection between the product and the customer. In order to do this, we are fitting SaaS companies on a spectrum according to their approach to the sales process. Before we do that, we would like to clarify that we aren’t arguing one over another but acknowledging their advantages and disadvantages on a contextual basis. We are going to use two companies that sell the same product, Dropbox vs. Box, but examine the difference in approach towards sales.
Box prefers a top-down approach for sales. They hire salespeople to go have meetings with enterprise accounts to secure higher contract value. However, Dropbox prefers a bottom-up approach with product doing most of the sales using lower ASP (average sales price). This is reflected in their spendings as well, while Dropbox’s Sales & Marketing budget is 26%, Box’s Sales & Marketing budget is 63%.
One of the advantages of being a product that is “bought” is that you can take advantage of product-led growth. For this, your product needs a low ASP, adoption before purchase, individual user use case and retail/self-service purchase. Product-led growth relies on product adoption before the point of purchase. Let’s not forget that every product of a company has a different strategy. The best possible example for this is HubSpot since they started their Marketing Suite product with the “sold” approach, and with time introduced different products with the “bought” approach such as their Sales Suite.
Companies can embody either bought or sold approach. However, this doesn’t mean that they have to stick with it. Every company might need to migrate to the other approach at some point. Salesforce started to sell directly to the consumer using their website back in 1999 using a bought approach, then they have moved up-market to serve enterprise clients while switching to a sold approach instead. We mentioned Slack as one of the best product-led SaaS companies out there. However, there is a counterintuitive aspect of having a product-led approach. After you accomplish a certain level of domination on the market using a bottom-up approach, you end up adding top-down approach to your toolset and go enterprise even if you have %30 conversion rate from freemium to paid like Slack. Going upmarket brings better ACV (average customer value) and less churn for the company. Slack is essentially after optimizing those metrics, realizing that their product-led growth for smaller customers is covered.
SaaStr explains it using Slack’s S-1 Document:
“Slack has gone Enterprise. Way Enterprise. Today, Slack has 575+ customers paying more than $100k a year, which important now accounts for 40%+ of its revenue. That’s way, way up from just 22% of revenue from $100k+ deals in 2017.”
We have talked too much about Slack, so it is only fair if we dig deeper to see what they have changed as a product-led company. Most probably your company uses Slack or one of your friends is using Slack within their company. How did companies got introduced and decided to purchase Slack?
The most common way of introduction is that one employee discovers Slack. Tries it out and falls in love with the product. She, then recommends it to her friends within the company and then employees ask their managers to buy Slack for the whole company.
If Slack was old school, they would recruit salespeople. They would try and hopefully get a meeting with the CIO of the target enterprise. Then the management team of the company would start the sales process that includes back and forth negotiations with Slack’s sales team. At the end of the process, employees would have to learn and use Slack as it becomes the go-to tool for in-house communication within the company. It is fair to say that this is the opposite of what we have now.
For these shifts to happen, four main aspects of the buying process changed:
Blake Bartlett from OpenViewPartners explains Product-Led Growth as:
“Product led growth (PLG) is an end user-focused growth model that relies on the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion.”
This end-user focus shifted the focus from, solving executive problems, which is “providing ROI” to solving employee problems, by “providing user-friendly easy to use tools”.
In 1898, Elias St. Elmo Lewis developed a model that mapped a theoretical customer journey. Beginning from the moment a brand or product attracted a consumer’s attention to the point of action or purchase. He created a four-stage process: Awareness, Interest, Desire, and Action (AIDA). This became famous with Alec Baldwin’s Always Be Closing punchline in Glengarry Glen Ross .
If you are a Saas founder and looking for a way to grow your sales, you would most probably hear funnel and repeatable sales already which became famous with Salesforce. All these methodologies are derivatives of AIDA.
All the shifts we have discussed so far is changing the customer journey and business models which requires us to think differently.
People used “the funnel” method to visualize the AIDA. However, the funnel is, as our friend Jacco van der Kooij Winning by Design puts it; “outdated — because it was designed from the seller’s perspective, not the buyer’s.” Now, the funnel is giving way to its successor, the Flywheel.
Flywheel gets its name from the inventions made by James Watt and James Pickard to enable the Industrial Revolution. The flywheel is explained as “a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently store rotational energy (kinetic energy).”
Using our analogy, the flywheel is a system different from a unidirectional funnel which was focused on the seller, by putting the customer in the middle and applying pressure from different points, Service, Marketing and Sales. Now, in the flywheel model, it is important to reach an understanding of customer journey shifts from a transactional model into continuous since, in the world of SaaS, the competition is ever increasing. Flywheel’s beauty is when you get going and move the flywheel, it is easier to go faster as it doesn’t suffer from the bottlenecks the traditional funnel method does, making it simpler and easier to acquire new customers.
The main reason for the need to change is underlying at the shift from perpetual license (software license that authorizes an individual to use a program indefinitely) to subscription.
For example,
In perpetual license world, if you were selling a $100,000 license
In the subscription world, if you sell the same software as above for 45–60% of the price that would be successful
The most important difference between the two models would be also your company’s value; while perpetual models valued around 1–2x of the revenue, currently subscription models valued between 8–14x of the revenue.
We decrease frictions in the processes and give the power to the user. We supply the customers with documentation, thus the ability to educate themselves about our product while also allowing them to try and experiment with it. We design the product with great simplicity to allow the onboarding rather quickly and most important of all, we delight the customers we already have.
In this high competition world, word of mouth is the best marketing tool of them all.
When Berkay Mollamustafaoglu and his co-founders Abdurrahim Eke and Sezgin Kucukkaraaslan started Opsgenie back in 2012 as a Mobile IT Management Software company. Berkay’s customer research was to engage in forums where the potential customers were. He went on forums to understand the problems the customers were facing and questions they were asking and build an understanding about the customer’s mindset. For example one of the important discoveries was how the customers were searching and using to define the product. Opsgenie was using “Mobile IT Management Software” to define their product, but after checking Google Trends and Keyword Planner, they realized customers were searching for “on-call or alert management”.
Putting all of the inputs from both customer interviews, forums and research on Google, they decided to position themselves as an incident management software. Considering existing solutions for incident management, they decided that they had to differentiate themselves. Opsgenie strategized their differentiation using the top 5 features the customers wanted from their competitors’ software but haven’t built yet and built those into the product in 6 months term. One example from those features was Opsgenie’s Mobile App. Competitors’ customers were receiving alerts via SMS which cost 35 cents in Europe and 10 cents in the US. Users were complaining about this cost and wanted a solution from Opsgenie’s competitors but they were slow to answer this request. By listening to the users, Opsgenie built their mobile app to send these alerts via mobile notifications which practically costs nothing and gave themselves a competitive advantage by removing friction for the users.
Following finding the product/market fit, they focused on building momentum to get the word out. Opsgenie then integrated with open-source monitoring tools which were widely used by potential customers, which they got the insight from their activity on the forums. Opsgenie got their first major boost from a Tweet by an industry influencer, about their mobile app which was an important differentiator that made people talk about Opsgenie.
Giving people topics that can make them talk about your company is the best thing you can do to grow.
Zeplin was founded by 3 developers and 1 designer. They worked in another company developing mobile apps. After they left the company, they wanted to build a solution for a problem of their own. Because it was their own problem, they thought their product would solve the problem in the market. However, the first product Zeplin developed did not meet the expectations of gaining traction. So the founders have contacted around 400 potential customers who they found and approached on LinkedIn, which resulted in more than 200 interviews. They used the outcomes of these interviews to understand the customer’s need to make their product better. Furthermore, they optimized their changes meaning they spent more time on what the functions that the customers need. After the changes to the product, it got attention from beta users and became a wanted product, even before their launch. Zeplin then launched on Product Hunt and became the #1 for the whole week.
Now, they have tens of thousands of customers. Only last July, almost 7 million designs from Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma and Photoshop CC were exported to Zeplin by thousands of product teams including Airbnb, Slack, Dropbox, Starbucks and more.

Each week at Venturescale, I unpack new insights about profitable markets — and how you can compete & monetize. Today’s post is about the future of SaaS. Read here if you’re interested in Web3 for creators, future of social networks, FinTech & wellness tech, or online marketplaces.
In a pre-SaaS (software-as-a-service) world, nearly every industry relied on Microsoft Excel. Accountants relied on it for finance management. Managers used it for project management. HR used it for payrolls and employee directories. The sales team used it for lead management and CRM. Individuals used it for to-do list planning.
As companies adopt digitization, operations and workflows become more complicated. Businesses need to find a way to automate and scale efficiently. Teams need to collaborate internally and externally. Specific use cases gave rise to the unbundling of Excel — businesses are created to replace spreadsheets with alternative tools that cater to a niche target audience, interest, and job-to-be-done.
Despite new players arise, Excel has yet to be completely replaced due to its decade-long usage, programming capabilities (i.e. Excel formula), and reliability.
In fact, most SaaS apps are simply products unbundled from Excel. These are businesses that turn spreadsheets into profitable software companies:
To understand the future of SaaS, we need to zoom into the transition of Excel unbundling. I call it Excel 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 of Excel unbundling:
A SaaS typically makes money through a monthly or yearly recurring subscription membership model by providing access to the product features. There are different ways to charge access for users, for example:
There are massive opportunities to build in the SaaS space. This section explores the key takeaways, the future of SaaS, and the “why now” questions (most important slide in a pitch deck!) for your investors:

As your startup grows, what your customers expect from you will change and the volume of their requests will change. You’ll shift from the reactive mode of supporting requests as they happen to the proactive mode of fixing issues before they ever become a problem.
I’ve spent the last seven years building the customer success function at HubSpot. I grew with the team, and played a big role in many of our successes…and failures. Along the way, I’ve talked to hundreds of founders, sales and marketing leaders, customer success VPs, and front-line reps about how to build a customer-first organization. Here’s how I’d recommend shifting your thinking about customer success as you grow.
(0 to 5 employees)
At this stage, customer support isn’t your primary focus. It’s likely not even a problem on your radar, nor should it be. Your #1 focus at this stage is product-market fit.
Customers are integral in this process because they provide feedback, and every member of your team should be answering support requests, meeting with customers, and thinking about how to build a product that suits the needs of the market.
(5–20 employees)
It’s time to hire your first customer-focused employee! This won’t be a “Chief Customer Officer” or a “Customer Success Manager.” They may not even be full-time. This will be someone who is dedicated 100% to helping customers and removing support load from the rest of the team.
Keep in mind that early-stage customer people are different from late-stage customer people.
In later stages you’ll want people who think about how to scale through process, training, and systems. Right now you just need someone who cares deeply about helping your customers.
This work is hard and often unglamorous. Play your “founder card” for this person, it will empower them to advocate to engineering to fix recurring bugs and usability issues, push back on sales if (when) they keep selling bad fit customers, and argue with marketing about how to represent the product.
Don’t get distracted by shiny things. Your priority is growth, and that’s driven by selling, not by customer success or renewal… yet. There are three very common shiny objects that derail customer success efforts in the early stage:
(20–100 employees)
Your customer base is growing, and demand for customer support is growing along with it. Your one customer-focused employee has become two (how’d that happen, anyway?), and you’re starting to see the path to having a whole gaggle of customer people very, very soon. You’re asking yourself, “Is this what scale looks like? Or am I screwing up this customer thing?”
What you need to do at this stage is act more deliberately than you have been been so far. It’s time to lay a foundation that you’ll keep for quite some time and do so purposefully.
The patterns that you develop at this key stage will grow with you and will spell the difference between running or stumbling as you hit the growth stage.
(100–250 employees)
Your company has (mostly) solved product/market fit. You’re scaling, fast. It’s working… congratulations!
As you enter the growth stage, your efforts will shift to making the economics of your business work. The key question you’re answering company-wide is: Can we acquire customers and get at least 3:1 return in our unit economics? Your team and investors will be paying close attention to customer lifetime value, and the customer success side of this equation is retention.
Up until now, your customer team has been focused on the reactive work of customer support, and you need to keep doing that. But you’ll also start building a customer success team responsible for the proactive work of customer retention.
The expanded focus on the customer requires a different type of leader who can manage both the existing team, and build your customer success function. This is a critical hire– you want a proper VP of Customer Success or Chief Customer Officer who is strong operationally, deeply empathetic, technical enough to liaise with engineering, and can grow customer success into a growth lever for the business. If you haven’t been cultivating this person internally, don’t compromise or wing it. Turn to your investors, board, or even headhunters to help make this hire.
Don’t ignore your customer team culture. Customer teams, especially support teams, deal with unhappy customers and a never-ending stream of customer needs, often bearing the brunt of the failures in your product and go-to-market teams. This is hard work that inevitably impacts team well-being. There are three things you cannot afford to overlook at this stage:
(250+)
HubSpot’s CEO, Brian Halligan, defines a scale-up as “Pouring resources in fast and getting a big return on them without the wheels coming off the bus.” You’ve identified your growth levers, now you’re going to see if that math scales.
Scaling up comes with CFO and board pressure to gain efficiency, and the natural tendency of a business will be to squeeze customer teams. Remember, making customers successful is a growth driver in your business. You want to keep costs down, but not at the expense of underinvesting in your customers.
Your actions at this stage should deliver either predictability or cost savings. There are three areas where you need to sharpen predictability:
Now let’s talk about cost savings. Until now, you’ve implemented automated process with caution. Now is the time to let loose. Start sending automated alerts to customer success managers when customer behavior indicates churn potential or upsell opportunity, automate your implementation workflow, maybe even build a chatbot to start helping you answer some FAQs. Consider hiring a “customer operations” person to focus on automation full-time.
I’ve just spent paragraphs talking about operations, analytics, and efficiency. At this stage, you too will spend lots of time talking about operations. And this comes with a critical word of warning: Do not lose your obsessive customer-focus.
Another big word of caution here: If you’re still in reactive support mode and don’t have any customer functions doing proactive work, you’re behind where you should be.
Some companies can get to the growth stage on customer support alone, but scaling up is dependent on your ability to predictably keep and grow customers. You’ll need a dedicated customer success team to make this happen. Don’t delay.
Most SaaS companies get serious about customer success after encountering a near-company-killing churn crisis. Churn spikes, panic sets in, analysis is done to uncover the problem, success people are hired. It’s rough.
If you can take the pointers offered in this post and implement even half of them, you’ll be a leader in customer success throughout all stages of the growth cycle of your business. The tips and strategies I’ve recommended are not particularly complex or clever–on the contrary, they’re at best just advanced common sense. But I hope that by adding them into your operations today and preparing you with foresight tomorrow you’ll be just a little more prepared for what’s coming your way.

There’s an obscene amount of money in the SaaS world.
Like, a crazy amount.
By 2018, worldwide SaaS revenue will be around $50.8 billion.
That’s billions of dollars.
That kind of money doesn’t just fall from the sky. Instead, it is driven by a strong inside sales focus.
How much of those billions of dollars do you want?
We’re not going to cover inside sales here, but instead start you off where you need to begin:
Your pricing strategy.
Before you go all in with a sales team, if your pricing isn’t right, any growth will likely kill your business.
Sales lead to growth, which leads to expansions and operational changes.
Without revenue to mitigate big changes, your cute little growing SaaS business will crumble under the weight of all that cash you’re hauling in.
So, we’re going to look at pricing strategy analysis, and specifically comparative value pricing, best practice pricing display, and what is working for the most unique and successful SaaS companies.
We’ll start with a quick primer on value-based pricing and then look at some examples.
Striking a balance in what you offer (features) and what you charge can be tricky.
You might “bundle” features into various configurations and have different pricing tiers and plans. This is most common.
However, some companies “unbundle” their product and end up offering a range of features that appeals to several different customer segments.
If you do this, you must clearly convey your reasons for breaking up your product or customers will move on to someone else.
The pricing complexity that often confuses customers is due to an emphasis on developing way too many unnecessary features that don’t justify the price.
Now, value-based pricing requires you to focus on how you can combine the right features to meet the needs of your ideal customers, but it cuts out any complexity.
When creating a simple, appealing pricing strategy, start by developing a valuable solution while correctly quantifying the value to the customer.
What you need to charge to run a profitable SaaS business is critical to know. But you also need to align this with market demand.
(A more advanced strategy for branding could help you charge 3x what competitors do, but that’s for another post.)
Of course, make sure that your price points will enhance your bottom line, but still fall within what customers are willing to pay.
To be honest, pricing is a process, so let’s look at four of the first steps to identify the right price.
This is critical. You have to truly understand your buyer’s persona and their purchasing behavior.
What are they used to paying?
What are they paying for — and how much?
Do they prefer monthly payments? Annual?
You have to know, as exactly as you can, what features of your product will have the most impact on your customer’s pain points.
When dealing with a SaaS product, it’s important to determine how your service will enhance or improve your customer’s business.
For example, will it save them money or time?
Will it set them apart from the competition?
Understanding your product’s value produces data that makes it easier to determine if you’re on the right track or if you need to head back to the drawing board.
What could you add to your product that would justify charging more?
How can you position and quantify your software for them?
To do this you will need to do two things:
Yes, this means split-testing your pricing, both on the pricing page but also with existing trial users.
You won’t know what they’ll pay until you present them with a choice. People can guess and tell you what they think they’ll pay but what matters is the actions they take.
Do you run the risk of pissing some off by giving people different prices? Not necessarily.
One approach is that with the different pricing comes a different set of features (you only need to switch out 1–2 features.)
Or, give a particular customer segment a price, i.e. IT services are given a pricing plan with a price, just for them.
You also need to look at the cost of doing business.
And if you’re intending on continually delivering value to your customers, you need to understand what that will cost you, too.
A lot of SaaS companies “fail” at this.
To some, $10/month sounds reasonable, but it probably won’t cover much of your expenses, let alone over-delivering on your software.
Consider development and operational costs that go into not just maintaining your product, but also what you need to expand and grow.
And if that wasn’t enough, remember that you want to maximize profits and revenue.
Simply covering your costs and adding a random margin may only leave a few crumbs on the table for profit.
Now, let’s look at a few SaaS companies and their pricing.
The image below shows you Freckle’s pricing plans.
Each plan offers a free trial, but the primary plan differences are team sizes along with added-value services. The features for each plan are the same.
Pricing strategy lesson: By basing price one team size, and adding additional value that’s not directly related to the product, they’re simultaneously positioning their software as a great deal while also making sure they can cover costs of more people using their platform.
AppFolio is a property management service.
They’re significantly removing barriers of signing up by offering 1 simple pricing plan:
For a product that’s probably easy to making pricing confusing for, they’ve made it incredibly simple. You also get all features and pricing is, similar to Freckle’s team size, based on property units.
Worth noting is the use of up-sells further down on their pricing page:
Pricing strategy lesson: The easy pricing and up-sells are strategic. They know that potential customers are likely to not have the resources for tenant liability insurance, a website and screening residents.
They’re adding these services in a move to capitalize on this market gap. In the process, they’re making their app a no-brainer in terms of pricing, while opening the door to additional revenue.
Visual Website Optimizer is an A/B testing service.
Here’s their pricing table:
They’re doing a good job making potentially complex plan-pricing easier by first splitting it up into two buckets: Standard or Enterprise.
The Enterprise plan is also positioned with a “Request a Demo” CTA, along with a phone number, “Best for” identifier and adding several more features.
Worth noting is that both types of plans do share common, most-used features of split-testing. Those on the Standard plans will not feel like they’re missing out on anything.
Pricing strategy lesson: The emphasis is on selling annual subscriptions, a move that has become increasingly popular in SaaS businesses. It helps them increase revenue upfront that can be used for re-investing in the business.
This is a smart move and one that more SaaS companies should adopt. Use your revenue and pricing strategically to help expansion and capturing market share.
To make sure they can support their software, their pricing changes with the amount of visitors you want to test on.
You can also see that they’re positioning their pricing by calling out who it’s for, in each category. This helps visitors quickly identify what they should be looking at for themselves.
Pricing your SaaS is more than just doing what sounds good to you, or seems to make sense.
If you don’t price for anticipating growth, you can have all the sales in the world coming through your door but still end up with a failed business.
Why?
Because unless your sales are profitable, any increase in sales will also increase cost.
If you’re charging $20/month but a new user is costing you close to $18, you don’t stand a chance.
Most SaaS companies fail to consider the cost of doing business, operations, support, staff and all the other common business expenses.
And they don’t price accordingly.
Other SaaS companies have a decent pricing model, but they’re not leveraging revenue potential to the fullest by offering plans based more on, say, team size, than their feature list.
Knowing your customers buying behavior, quantifying value, experimenting with pricing and having a clear understanding of operational costs will help you price your SaaS for success.

The general rule of thumb for spending in SaaS is 40/40/20. In other words, 40% of operating expense should be on R&D, 40% should be on sales and marketing, and 20% should be on G&A. Rules of thumb are just generalizations, so we wanted to see what the data really is. 28 SaaS companies have gone public from 2018 to today and below are their margins. Perhaps the rule of thumb should be 30/50/20. The data is below.
30/50/20. On median, 30% of opex is R&D, 47% is on sales and marketing, and 22% is on G&A. The rule is therefore “30/50/20” may be more accurate.
There are outliers. Rules of thumb are just general guidelines, and sure enough there are significant outliers. 45% of Dropbox’s spend was on R&D while only 13% of Zoom’s spend is on R&D. Similarly, 73% of Zoom’s spend was on sales & marketing, Dropbox spent only 37% on S&M, and Bill.com spent 28% on S&M. Snowflake spent a whopping 130% of revenue on S&M and indeed their EBITDA margin is the worst of the bunch at -192%.
Don’t let G&A be the outlier. Obviously you should minimize spend on G&A. Building product and selling it should be the priorities. Cloudflare, Sendgrid, Snowflake, and Palantir I’m looking at you (they spend 36%, 34%, and 37%, and 43% of opex on G&A).
COGS isn’t 20%. The other rule of thumb that needs to be debunked is that COGS is 20% of revenue. As you can see, the median and averages are 25% and 27% respectively.
Where is the profitability? We put together simplified EBITDA calculations based on the data (Revenue — COGS — R&D — S&M — G&A). Only 3 out of the 28 companies have positive EBITDA. Not only that, but the median and average EBITDA margins are an anemic -28% and -34%. Even more alarming, the average EBITDA margin of the last 6 companies to go public was -74% (if you exclude Snowflake, it’s still a very bad -50%).
Indeed, software is forgiving: so long as you’re growing fast, have excellent retention, and marquee customers you’re allowed to burn cash as recurring revenue that doesn’t churn is an annuity with tremendous value.
Overall we found the data to be really compelling: 30/50/20 is the new 40/40/20 for more established SaaS businesses, unprofitability is ok so long as your business fundamentals are solid and you’re growing, and COGS is allowed to be slightly higher than 20% of revenue.

Two metrics we use to compare software businesses are revenue per employee and operating expense (opex) per employee. In our view these are great measures of operational efficiency. What is a reasonable amount of rev/head and opex/head in SaaS? The data from the last 28 SaaS IPOs is below.
Headcount. The median headcount of these companies at IPO was 900 with the average coming in slightly higher at 1,181. The largest company was Docusign (2,255 employees) and the smallest was Datadog (474).
Revenue per head. Rev/head on median was $199k with a range of $47k to a whopping $595k. Interestingly, the company with $595k of revenue per head was Dropbox who has a very large consumer and SMB customer base. The company with $47k of revenue per head is the highly valued (arguably materially overvalued) Snowflake.
Opex per head. Opex/head on median was $191k with a range of $104k (Zoominfo) to $458k (again Dropbox).
The difference is small. The difference between revenue/head and opex/head is quite tight and indeed once you factor in COGS, 25 out of these 28 companies are not generating positive EBITDA.

Pricing software-as-a-service (SaaS) presents unique challenges — and opportunities — for product and marketing teams.
In the past few years I’ve had a hand in setting pricing for several successful SaaS products, including GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, AppFolio and my current company ProductPlan (product roadmap software). In this article I’ll talk about the lessons I’ve learned along the way.
Let’s start with what I consider to be the #1 most important element for pricing SaaS products: customer value.
Understanding customer value is essential for pricing all software products, but even more so with SaaS.
Because most SaaS products are priced with a recurring subscription, every month or year your customers reevaluate whether they want to continue subscribing. This makes it even more critical to ensure pricing is in line with the value your customers receive.
Let me define what I mean by “value.” First, value can be quantitative, such as time saved or additional revenue earned. Measuring this is straightforward, and is the basis of Return on Investment calculations. If your product is B2B SaaS, you are likely already factoring this in to your pricing decision.
But here is the tricky part: Value can also be qualitative, such as pain relieved or lifestyle benefits your product provides. By thoroughly understanding and documenting this sometimes nebulous qualitative value through customer interviews, you can begin to narrow in on possible pricing models and a price range.
It’s understanding this qualitative value that can help product managers set their product apart from the competition.
I believe that customer value should be the primary consideration for your price and pricing model. Not features. Not what competitors charge. And definitely not your costs.
When we were determining pricing for GoToMeeting, I interviewed dozens of potential customers to gain a deep understanding of customer pain and the value they might receive from conducting online meetings with our concept. We discovered:
By understanding these quantitative and qualitative values, we developed GoToMeeting’s unique $49 “All You Can Meet” flat-rate pricing (an industry-leading innovation at the time).
The pricing model directly relates to the pain and frustration we heard from prospective customers in our interviews — the current solutions were difficult to budget because the per-minute charges varied so widely. The buyer experienced sticker shock every month. Therefore, peace of mind was another qualitative value we could provide customers with our pricing model.
While it’s hard to assign a dollar amount to qualitative values, these are the benefits that ultimately made GoToMeeting a no-brainer for millions of customers.
Because the product was SaaS, we had the flexibility to price our product differently from the competition and create a unique product in the market. In a sense, we made pricing a part of the product. It became a differentiating feature that marketing promoted heavily.
Most product managers already know that finding the right price is more art than science. However, if you thoroughly understand the value for your SaaS product, you can delight customers, provide competitive differentiation and ultimately launch a more profitable product.
It’s a brave new world for pricing software-as-a-service products. Gone are the days of simply setting a per-seat fee and launching.
I now want to talk a bit about why SaaS gives product and marketing managers unprecedented flexibility to choose unique pricing models. Models that can differentiate your product in the marketplace. Models that ideally align with your customers’ goals.
One of the exciting advantages of SaaS is that you can think differently about pricing models. Unlike traditional software, customers licensing SaaS products pay for your product on a recurring basis. Your product is no longer tied to a one-time purchase. And because the product is centrally hosted, you have additional flexibility for offering your product in unique packages.
SaaS gives you the ability to consider revenue models that weren’t previously possible. Here’s a short (and by no means exhaustive) list of pricing models used today. Many products use a combination of these models:
Feel free to add to this list in comments. My point is that with so many options, you now have the ability to discover a pricing model that aligns with your customers’ goals.
For AppFolio’s property-management software, we developed a unique pricing model based on the number of rental units managed by a property manager. Because we charged a flat $1 per rental unit per month, the pricing was simple and easy to understand.
This pricing model resonated with customers because it aligned with their business goals. They paid more for our product only if they grew their business by adding rental units to their portfolio. If they were more successful, we were more successful.
When pricing a new product, there is a temptation to set your pricing relative to the competition. It’s common for new products to price using the same model as competitors, but slightly lower. Sure, you can price the same way as your competitors, and perhaps that’s what your customers expect.
But with SaaS, there are so many ways to price the product that you have the ability to stand out in the market by thinking differently. Capitalize on the approaches that your competitors haven’t considered.
Don’t overly-complicate pricing. With so much flexibility in SaaS pricing options, there is a temptation to offer various flavors and packages.
Sometimes there are legitimate reasons for doing so. For example, it’s common to have three packages based on features. Studies show that this approach anchors customers, and can be an effective technique for driving customers to your best-performing package. That’s fine if this is your goal.
However, creating an overly complicated pricing scheme has the potential to confuse customers and create a nightmare for your finance team. Keeping it simple reduces headaches and may even provide more revenue over the long term.
For example, at ProductPlan (product roadmap software), we saw that products in our space had complicated licensing options. Many required a paid license for every software user. Several offered complicated pricing tiers based on packages.
We took a different approach to simplify pricing. We charged only for editors of roadmap data and offered free licenses to other collaborators. Rather than offering complicated pricing tiers based on features, we offered unlimited use of all features for one price.
Because the product managers want to widely distribute the product roadmap to stakeholders, this model benefits the customer. It’s aligned with their goals. In addition, this model gives our product more exposure within the organization, so ultimately we sell more licenses when other departments ask to use the software.
Here are 10 tips that you can use when pricing SaaS products. While many of these apply to SaaS products, the lessons overall apply to software products in general. Here we go:
With web-based SaaS products, it’s easier than ever to conduct A/B tests to gauge buyer behavior, pricing, and acquisition costs (before and after launch). As you test the user interface, I encourage you to test your pricing with equal fervor.
Use qualitative customer interviews to get enough data points to make good decisions. Get the pricing right, and you have a recurring revenue stream that places your product’s portfolio value well above traditional software products.
Pricing is such a core part of a SaaS product’s business model that you need to get it right. These are a few of my lessons. Please add your own lessons in comments — I’d love to hear them!

Do you want to know what the best channels are to promote your content?
As you know… writing a long, quality piece of content is not a simple thing. Then to spread it to the world… much harder!
Whether you’re a startup, growth or expansion stage SaaS company, organic marketing is normally the go-to lead gen strategy because of it’s cost advantages and proven effectiveness at driving higher quality leads.
The only real costs are the salaries of the staff to create the content.
But the problem is…
CONTENT PROMOTION
Most SaaS companies invest time and money to create content, then make the BIG mistake of never promoting it.
Their idea of content promotion is 1 email blast to their email newsletter.
Then that’s it.
But if your sales team needs leads now, or you have aggressive growth targets you need to hit this quarter…
Then you need your content to generate new leads fast… so you have safe, consistent, scalable lead flow.
Ask yourself this question…
Do you have a fool-proof system for how to promote your best content?
If not… here is the 2-part fool-proof system our agency has developed so you can successfully promote every piece of B2B SaaS content you write to your target audience.
I first want to cover a simple 5-step organic strategy, because I know a lot of SaaS companies want to do everything they can to move their content piece organically before thinking about paid traffic.
Here is the organic strategy, in an easy step-by-step checklist format:
Step 1: Send email to list (at whatever time you have the highest open rate, based on your historical email stats)
Step 2: Share article on social media accounts as soon as email campaign is sent
Step 3: Look for channels relevant to your SaaS and submit links there (eg: forums, FB groups, Slack groups)
Step 4: Wait for a few days to get some analytics data (stats, shares and comments)
Step 5: Send emails or tweet editors of big publishers who report on your content topic with eye-catching headline and screenshot of proof of traction (eg: “My post has 50% share rate, screenshot attached, repost maybe?”)
The goal with your organic content promotion is to identify which pieces of content get the most engagement (shares and comments) with YOUR market organically.
Once you know which of your content pieces perform the best organically, you can then follow this next strategy to get even more highly targeted visitors reading your content and engaging with your brand.
NOTE: If you already have proven content pieces (with significant shares and comments), you can skip straight to this next part…
Most SaaS marketers idea for paid content promotion is:
Step 1: Hit the “promote post” button on FB and Twitter
Step 2: Hope and pray the post generates bulk traffic and leads
Let me show you a better way…
At my agency we developed a system called the “SaaS DNA Profile”.
The SaaS DNA Profile is made up of 24 unique data points.
It starts with the Industry Vertical in grey on the bottom right.
We then go into the Demographic Data on the top row in gold that includes… Company Size, Revenue, Job Title, Age, Gender, Income, Marital Status and Location
After that we look at the Psychographic Data in orange on the middle row that includes: Software, Celebrities, Blogs, Books, Topics, Keywords, Media and Competitors
Then we look at the Competitive Intelligence Data in red on the bottom row that includes: Competitor Keywords and Competitor Ads
And finally we identify all the Owned Media that we can leverage on the bottom row in yellow that includes: Website Traffic, Blog Content, TOFU, MOFU and BOFU (I’ll explain what those acronyms mean later if you haven’t read my other articles).
What I’m going to do is show you a case study of HubSpot, and how we use the SaaS DNA Profile to come up with a Paid Content Promotion Plan before ever promoting any content on any ad networks.
The first piece of data I’m going to cover is Industry Vertical.
Your SaaS might target 1 industry vertical or multiple industry verticals.
But’s it’s important at this stage to just pick the 1 industry vertical that you want to build your paid content promotion campaign around, then go back through this process for other industry verticals once you finish.
For HubSpot, one of their biggest industry verticals is Professional Services.
And one of their main target customers within that industry is Marketing Agencies who are a major channel sales partner for HubSpot.
In particular their product is a great fit for Marketing Agencies who sell web design, online marketing, branding, social media marketing, SEO, SEM and advertising services.
After we know what vertical we’re targeting, we then define the key demographic data of our clients ideal target customer in that vertical.
We select the most relevant demographic data points from the 8 you can see highlighted on the screenshot above.
For HubSpot, I’ve used 4 of the 8 demographic data points to further define their ideal target customer.
This is a Marketing Agency who has a:
After we know who the customer is that we want our sales people talking to and signing up for our software, we now need to identify the psychographic profile of that customer.
We’ll then use that psychographic profile to start to develop a plan to target only qualified prospects who like specific activities, opinions and interests.
At this stage we pick a mix of 5 psychographic data points, and start our research process.
For HubSpot we chose Software, Celebrities, Blogs, Topics and Competitors.
We first start by identifying 1 well-known psychographic data point in each category.
For HubSpot we know that many small to medium size marketing agencies:
From their we would then expand our list of psychographics by using research tools to find similar software, celebrities, blogs, topics and competitors in the market.
This will give us a tight list of 5–10 data points in each category that we can then use to promote our content to at a later stage.
In the screenshot above you can see the list of psychographics that we researched for HubSpot in each category.
Now that we know who our ideal target customer is and the psychographics we can use to target them, we now need to have a proven sales funnel in place to convert that traffic into sales (using our Owned Media).
In general there are 3 types of media…
Owned media consists of marketing assets that you’re in full control of. The primary goal with your owned media is to continue to provide value to leads as they move down your sales funnel.
At our agency we like to find ways to leverage owned media that’s already been working for our clients, and drive paid traffic to it so we can do more of what already works.
To do that we leverage lead assets and inbound sales funnels that have already proven to work for SaaS companies organically.
What we’ve found is that the most successful SaaS companies have a TOFU, MOFU and BOFU offer (even though they may not call them that).
TOFU meaning top-of-funnel, MOFU middle-of-funnel and BOFU bottom-of-funnel.
You can see on the above screenshot 3 examples of SaaS companies (including HubSpot) who use a TOFU/MOFU/BOFU funnel to convert cold traffic into new sales.
A TOFU is a top-of-the-funnel lead asset that is built to acquire market specific leads. It’s job is to appeal to both beginners and veterans alike so you can fill the top of your funnel with thousands of leads.
One of HubSpot’s many TOFU lead assets is a Buyer Persona template that helps marketing agencies define their ideal buyer persona.
Their marketing automation then pushes people down to the middle-of-the-funnel where they have their Buyer Persona webinar offer, and then finally down into a bottom-of-funnel Free Trial offer for their software product.
To get marketing agencies into the funnel, HubSpot have a strategic piece of content that first gets people engaged in the topic and promotes their TOFU offer.
By promoting a high quality piece of content, with a proven inbound marketing funnel behind it you almost guarantee your paid content promotion will produce results.
This strategy gives people value first and is the strategy we recommend so you can fly under the “ad radar” of your prospects on any ad network, by showing them a native piece of content that gets them really interested in your TOFU offer.
To find a company’s highest converting pieces of blog content we will look inside their Google Analytics account to see which blog posts are driving the highest amount of Goal Conversions.
Or if the company doesn’t have Goal Conversions setup to track their organic leads, then we’ll take a look at which of their evergreen blog posts have the most amount of comments and shares.
Finally, now that we’ve identified the owned media assets we’re going to use to send traffic to from our paid ads, we want to take a look to see what’s working for our competitors, so we can get 2 key pieces of data:
1) Proven topic ideas to add to our psychographic profile
2) Ad copy ideas for when we write our ad copy
Here is one of HubSpot’s major competitors… Pardot, and a list of Pardot’s top 5 PPC keywords that they have been paying to advertise on for over 380 days.
Because Pardot has been advertising on these keywords for such a long period of time, there is a high probability that these keywords are profitable for them.
By looking for patterns in the keyword data, we can find profitable topics we can advertise on.
For simplicity I’ve only displayed 5 keywords on the screen out of the 5,400 Pardot advertise on. But just from looking at these 5 we can already start to see some of the most profitable topics we could add to HubSpot’s psychographic profile like “Inbound Marketing” and “Lead Qualification”.
We’ll also look at their highest converting ad copy to see what the “buzzwords” are in that market getting people to click on their ads.
We’ll then incorporate some of those “buzzwords” in our ads (if they make sense with the content piece) to get a higher click-through-rate.
When we start digging even deeper into the different paid media funnels Pardot have setup, we can also start to get ideas for high converting ad copy from their PPC landing pages.
If HubSpot aren’t getting a high enough landing page conversion rate on their TOFU offer, then we’ll look at competitive intelligence data like this and provide their team with recommendations for landing page optimizations.
By modeling the highest converting landing pages in the market, we can often get significant lifts in lead conversions.
When you get this right… you go from blindly guessing how your going to promote your content… to targeting based on these 5 different layers.
You develop a plan based on what’s proven to already work in your market, so you only show your ads to the most qualified traffic with your proven-to-convert owned media assets.
Here’s what HubSpot’s final paid content promotion plan looks like.
We now have 5 audiences we can start promoting our content to.
You can see we’ve researched 5 different categories of ad targets (based on industry vertical, demographic and psychographic, and we added in some of the most profitable competitive intelligence data we found).
By doing it this way, we’ve built the whole paid content promotion plan around HubSpot’s ideal customer profile so we get qualified traffic.
Here is a summary of the paid content strategy, in an easy step-by-step checklist format:
Step 1: Identify industry vertical you want to target
Step 2: Identify key demographic data points you want to target
Step 3: Identify key psychographic data points you want to target
Step 4: Identify key competitive intelligence data points you want to target
Step 5: If your goal is lead generation, make sure you have owned media assets to move people through your funnel (Blog Post > TOFU > MOFU > BOFU)
Step 6: Create audiences on the media channels where your target customer hangs out
Step 7: Promote your content to them (watch this webinar if you want to see how we do it)
The real secret behind the success of many multi-million dollar paid media campaigns is in customer avatar research.
Paid content promotion works, but most people don’t do it right because they skip over the research that is “tedious” and “boring”.
Each piece of content has a unique audience and each audience has its own problems.
When it comes to content marketing for your SaaS remember this rule…
200% promotion, 200% writing
Don’t sacrifice the time you spend on your writing for promotion. Shitty content doesn’t spread. The 200/200 rule means you should be twice as strategic about your content promotion, and twice as dedicated to writing unique, original content than your competitors.
Do this and you won’t have a traffic or lead generation problem ever again. You’ll have consistent, targeted, compounding traffic.

A while back, we wrote a post that made a lot of folks a little angry: “Workday is growing 90% this Year. At $250m in ARR. So Wake Up. You Probably Need to Do a Lot, Lot Better”. Looking, back it was a rather aggressive headline And more importantly, people were upset because Workday was seen as a complete outlier. You take the founders of Peoplesoft (acquired for $10b), add infinite capital, and do a re-do in the same space … well of course you’ll have an outlier, people said. Not fair. We can’t possibly do as well. Not a fair yardstick.
OK. Let’s fast forward to today, and figure out what is “fair”. Let’s look at the latest SaaS IPOs and IPOs-to-be.
Let’s start with Twilio — the most successful tech IPO of the year. Twilio went public when the consensus view was the IPO window was barely open. So Twilio priced low (which was smart), exceeded expectations in the next quarter, and thus, has appreciated 250% since the IPO. Boom!
But to me that isn’t interesting. That’s just a price for a share of stock. What’s interesting to me is using Twilio to help us think about: What’s the Bar for SaaS Success going into 2017?
So let’s de-pack Twilio’s growth at ~$300m ARR:
Growing 70% year over year, folks.
Now let’s fast forward to the latest private unicorn SaaS company to file to go public, Coupa. Coupa just filed, but we do have the financials through Q2’16:
And what do we see again? Growing 70% year over year, folks. Here, probably at $140m ARR or so, vs. $200m+ when Twilio filed. But still, well past $100m ARR and still growing 70% YoY.
The two companies are no doubt, different. Twilio has been more capital efficient. Twilio has a radically different go-to-market, as an API service, and a jealously-inspiring amount of “automatic” expansion in accounts (you use more, you pay more). Coupa by contrast is a classic enterprise business process management solution, for procurement and spend management, founded by seasoned Oracle veterans.
And the two companies are also probably different than your company. They are both in established, very large spaces. Yes, Twilio did something very disruptive and new in providing a super developer-friendly voice API and service. That was new and cool. But at a meta-level, telephony itself, voice, is one of the largest categories of “allocated spend” in corporations. And importantly — something customers are trained to pay for and value. (I’ve watched this also fuel hyper-growth at Talkdesk). Similarly, Coupa’s space — procurement and spend management — is a classic, large category of enterprise software (see SAP, Ariba, etc.). Large companies are willing, and perhaps even more importantly forced to, spend large amount of money to manage the billions in products and services they buy. And have been doing so for decades. Put differently. Both Twilio and Coupa have access to a lot of existing buyer budget.
But here’s my take-away. It’s the same take away from when Workday IPO’d, and I admit, it’s a little annoying to hear. But. The markets are bigger than ever in SaaS folks. Much bigger. Like 500x bigger than 10 years ago. Like 10x bigger than 5 years ago. So … You can do better. Especially if you have happy customers and product-market fit. That’s the hardest part today. Too many vendors, too many products. If you’ve gotten past that, have true (even if early) product-market fit and have high NPS … you are golden these days. Even if it doesn’t feel like it.
If Twilio and Coupa can grow 70% Year over Year as they breeze past $150m in ARR … why should you settle for 60% growth at $8m in ARR? Or 100% at $4m in ARR? You shouldn’t. Don’t settle.
Your market is being disrupted just as much as telephony and spend management are. Sales, marketing, software development, CRM, ERP, enterprise video, search, QA, fleet management, e-discovery, recruiting, performance management, you name it. It’s all going through a SaaS/cloud disruption. That disruption means there absolutely, positively, are another 50–100 customers out there for every single one you have today. There is no chance you have maxxed our your market. There isn’t.
And if the law of so-called large numbers didn’t stop Coupa and Twilio at $150m ARR, it certainly shouldn’t stop you at $15m ARR, let alone $5m.
So there is no excuse for not growing faster.
Here’s my real point. Whatever your growth rate is today, don’t accept it. Don’t accept a Q4 than isn’t at least 50% bigger than Q1. Don’t accept growth rate < 100% — ever. Not until you are huge. This doesn’t mean you have to beat up your team. Maybe it’s too late to impact this year, and maybe changing the plan too aggressively for next year is too daunting for the team, today. Maybe. Maybe this is only a conversation you have with your co-founder, in quiet, privately.
But the markets are bigger, faster, and stronger than ever in SaaS. It just takes a small migration of the $1 trillion in IT spend to create scores of IPOs. Just tapping into a tiny bit more of a larger-ish market will easily get you an extra $1m, $3m, $10m in ARR.
I mean, look, 10,000 founders, VPs and VCs are coming to the SaaStr Annual ’17. Ten thousand. How is that even possible. I never would have thought. It’s because everything is bigger in SaaS these days, folks.
Go forth and conquer! You can do it. And don’t settle for 2011–2015 growth rates, anymore.

In the rush to grab a piece of the $500bn software market, we see a lot of SaaS startups focusing almost entirely on marketing efficiency.
Fine. You’ve found your customers, but what are you really doing for them?The sales pitch isn’t exactly the easy thing, but it is very far from being everything. As someone who started their career in software in the 90s, I remember the practice of selling empty ‘seat licenses’ to big enterprises that didn’t need half of them.
The result was short-term growth and ultimately, reduced maintenance revenue, poor references, and companies that should never have been funded. A case of buyer — and investor — beware.
Back then my mentor at Apax, Peter Englander, taught me to visit references to understand how integral using the software was to end users. In today’s SaaS world, where software usage has become measurable in terms of reach, usage frequency, virality, data or transaction intensity, we no longer have to do that.
What matters today is usage.
At Mosaic Ventures we look for companies that focus on product and measured customer experience as the real drivers of business model innovation. These provide context for the other financial and marketing metrics that are commonplace (and obviously still important).
After one entrepreneur recently shared his operating numbers with me I was struck by the richness of this metrication within what was really quite a small startup. With this data, you know exactly who your users are and how useful your software is to them. And yet very few SaaS startups present their businesses to us by highlighting their usage metrics, or maximising the measured efficacy that their customers derive from their product.
We want a demonstration of the real value a startup brings.
We like how Danish-founded SaaS leader Zendesk benchmarks and shares best practises, which both drives usage and feeds it back as added value to its customers.
Two other well-executed examples lie in two of the fastest growing startups of the past 18 months, Slack and Zenefits.
Slack’s pricing model is per seat, but unused seats are measured and customers are reimbursed for seats that don’t use the application in a given month. This builds an unusually high level of trust between customer and vendor, and supports the decision to purchase more seats up front. It’s genius. Zenefits’ platform is free and the customers only pay for the insurance plans they purchase over it. Initial free entry cost has led to remarkable growth, and an aggressive network effect, pulling both customers and third party vendors onto the Zenefits platform.
Both of these models reduce friction to adopt because they believe in the utility of their offering.
One of my pre-Mosaic investments was in Swedish-founded contract analytics focused Seal Software. Initial contracts always focus on getting usage going because the company is so confident in demonstrable value — indeed, almost every customer has analysed more contracts via Seal over time.
Squarespace, which my partner Simon invested in in a personal capacity pre-Mosaic, is another product-centric ‘consumerised’ application. One of the reasons it has been so successful in a crowded space (GoDaddy, 1&1, Wix, Jimdo, Weebly etc.), is its fantastic UI, while its growing library of templates eases the pain of building a website for new customers. That UI and library provides immediate value generates tremendous word of mouth. That lowers CAC and allows the company to price at a premium.
The common thread between these companies is the early utility that their product demonstrates, which unlocks large, long-term customer lifetime value. Product and business model are intimately related.
By contrast, we evaluated a fast growing security SaaS business where it turned out that 80% of customers and prospects really weren’t vulnerable in a way that justified current pricing. We passed on the investment.
Entrepreneurs with great product aimed at a large market, who understand how it enables their business model, are able to take the calculated risks that can lead to them growing into big companies.
The SaaS companies we want to invest in need to be product focused and driven by customer usage and value. And they know that. You don’t get to scale or to network effects without tremendous initial utility. That’s why we love product-focused entrepreneurs because product always wins.

What’s a North Star Metric?The North Star Metric is the single metric that captures the core value that the product delivers to customers. It’s a metric where any team can rally behind to create aliment along with value with customers.
Since handfull of the Product Managers out there are trying to figure out their NSM, I thought out I would be helpful to compile it
This messaging platform is one of my favorite lists of B2B products, Intercom has allowed 30,000+ businesses to communicate with prospective and existing customers within their app, on their website, through social media, or via email.

There are still arguments about why ARR or MAU should not be included in North Star Metric Norms, we shall look at why a product or a team should have an NSM
NSM bring in a focus and organization clarity on Vision what each member of the team are running towards
But all being said what makes a north star metric successful is a Team that carries it. When your developers are building something or on the discussion about a feature or even Customer support talks to a customer, they ask themselves or their peers if their current action is value adding to the NSM which say
Every PM has to be able to communicate what’s the value of the product. Every employee of the company has to be able to know how the company is doing without sifting through pages of the dashboard.
Hope you liked the article, Let’s strive to achieve that one metric & make our organization organized under a single vision and follow it rigorously

No one ever listens to me, but I’ll keep saying it — building a product and then learning about marketing is a backwards process for most SaaS businesses. I’ve learned it the hard way. Unless you’re building a new technology or have a unicorn-like idea, it makes sense to learn how to market your product first (or at least learn about marketing while you’re building your product).

A few years ago, Rory O’Driscoll of Scale Venture Partners, an early investor in Box, DocuSign, ExactTarget, and many other large enterprise SaaS companies, published a fascinating article titled ”Understanding the Mendoza Line for SaaS growth”. The key message of the article is that “… most of the time, growth rates only decline, but do so in a way that is on average fairly predictable.” Looking at the data from 21 SaaS companies, Rory estimated that the growth rate for any given year is between 80% and 85% of the growth rate in the prior year. He referred to this as growth persistence.
An intriguing implication of this observation is that if you assume growth persistence to be constant over a company’s lifetime, you can predict its future growth based on its ARR number of three consecutive years. What’s more, if you assume that growth persistence is pretty universal across SaaS companies, you need only two ARR numbers to predict a company’s trajectory.
Using a growth persistence estimate of 82%, and assuming that to be IPO-able you have to be at $100M in ARR while still growing 25% or more in the following year, Rory calculated the “Mendoza Line for SaaS growth”:
The theory behind the Mendoza Line is compelling, and the fact that growth rates tend to decline as companies get larger seems to support it. But is it actually true? As Rory emphasized, it is a rule of thumb that works well on average, recognizing that there are exceptions:
“This is a heuristic, not a law of physics.”
Many of our portfolio companies had a slow start, ups and downs, or a bad year at some points in their lives but were able to reignite growth again later on. This includes several SaaS companies that are on track to hit $100M ARR in the next 1–2 years. Oh, and almost none of these unicorns in the making followed the T2D3 path. Narrative violation? ;-) In any case, I became curious to find out more about how useful the heuristic is, so I decided to do some number crunching.
I’ve looked into two datasets:
Compared to Scale’s data, the public market dataset is from much later-stage companies, while the P9 Family data is from a much earlier-stage portfolio.
Plotting the data points from the first dataset gives us this scatter chart:
The blue trendline tells you that if you grow x percent in any given year, you can expect to grow 0.43 times x plus 21 percent in the following year.¹⁾ If we force the regression line to go through (0,0) to make it more comparable with Scale’s analysis, we get the green trendline, which has a slope of 0.775, quite close to the 80–85% from Scale’s research.²⁾ The correlation between the growth rate in any given year and the following year is 0.54.
Depending on the model you’re using to fit the data (y=ax+b or y=ax), the slope of the line is quite different, and it’s not entirely clear (at least to me) which function is the best representation of reality. So let’s look at the data in a different way:
To create this view, I’ve put all data pairs into one of 12 buckets based on the change in growth from year n to year n+1. Note that I’m using percentage points here, so “minus 20–30%”, for example, means a slowdown from, say, 70% to 40–50%.
What you can see here is that for more than one-third of the data pairs, the company’s ARR growth rate has increased from one year to the next year. In most of these cases, the acceleration was minor (0–10%), but still, it’s remarkable that a rule of thumb, which most investors consider an obvious truth, seems to be wrong one out of three times. If you ever have a bad year, don’t despair. There is hope. :-) ³⁾
The median growth persistence in the public company dataset is 89%, but if you look at this histogram, you’ll see a huge variance:
Only 71 out of 218 data pairs are in the 80–100% bucket, so based on this dataset, growth persistence is not a universal constant across companies. Looking at the raw data company-by-company, I can see a lot of variation of growth persistence across companies’ lifetimes as well, so it doesn’t look like growth persistence is somehow built into companies’ DNAs either.
Next, let’s look at the SaaS companies in P9’s portfolio. As a reminder, most of the data is from the $1–20M ARR range, but there’s a significant number of data pairs in the $20–100M range.
According to Rory, growth decay becomes fairly predictable from around $10M ARR on, so it’s not surprising that compared to the late-stage dataset, we can see even more outliers and even more variance in the early-stage dataset. The median growth persistence in our portfolio is 75%, but as you can see in the histogram above, only 27 out of 96 data pairs are in the 62–102% range, so in more than two-thirds of the cases, growth persistence is either way above or way below the median.
The correlation between the growth rate in year n and year n+1 is 0.49 (compared to 0.54 for later-stage companies). Interestingly (coincidentally?), the percentage of data pairs in the “acceleration bucket” (the green ones in the table above) is almost exactly the same as in the public SaaS dataset.
To summarize:
Rory wrote that in Scale’s analysis, “only 30 percent of them [44 public SaaS companies] had one year of growth re-acceleration”. The result of my analysis is very similar — the only way in which I slightly disagree with Rory’s take-away is that to me, that’s a one-third full glass. :-)
¹⁾ I find the 21% part of the formula (the y-axis intercept) a little suspicious since it predicts y>x (acceleration) for low values of x (slow growth). Remember that we’re looking at a pretty small dataset with many outliers and an R-squared value of only 29.3%, so I wouldn’t take the result at face value.
²⁾ In Excel, there’s a simple setting that lets you choose a y-intercept for a linear regression. In Google Sheets, you have to calculate the function and add it to the chart as a separate series, as I did here. Maybe Google doesn’t want to make it too easy to remove the constant from the trendline because it can easily lead to deceptive interpretations?
³⁾ Strictly speaking, the table above doesn’t show how frequently companies manage to re-accelerate after one or more “bad years”. In theory, most of the green data pairs might come from companies that keep increasing their growth rates all the time. Something for a follow-up post, maybe.

For many SaaS applications, product designers need to design permission systems due to privacy concerns and data safety, or in order to make it more efficient and relevant for different types of users. It could be a challenge to set up the structure and continue scaling it as your product evolves.
Let me share some concepts and ideas based on my experience designing permissions for an enterprise data…

https://medium.com/hackernoon/b2b-saas-evolving-from-founder-selling-to-a-sales-team-9e8e759c3e8a?source=search_post---------228,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
For SaaS companies with a somewhat complicated sales model (i.e. sales process that involves a person talking to a prospect in order to close a deal), the sales process should evolve as the company grows. The best way to move through this evolution is to relieve the congestion that naturally occurs in the sales funnel as it builds (and not before that). In my experience, evolving from founder selling to building a sales team too quickly comes with a lot of risk that is easily avoided by making sure you are ready for each new phase in the evolution.
Here’s the phases most B2B SaaS companies should pass through and the risks at each step.
In this phase the founder is typically the person that does the “selling”. That’s a good thing because there is still a lot to learn from interacting with customers. Founders will learn what works in their value proposition, what the typical objections are that might stall a deal and what really gets a prospect excited. This stage is where you are perfecting your sales pitch and your demo. Also, importantly, you are learning how your prospects like to buy — do they have to get approval from purchasing? What person in the company has authority to do a deal? Are there legal hoops you might have to jump through? How would you qualify a prospect as one that is likely to move forward or not? Leads at this phase are usually coming from working your network for warm referrals. A Phase 1 sales process typically looks like this:
As you get more experience selling and a better understanding of who you are targeting, you will start to get more efficient at closing deals. Soon the only thing holding you back from selling more is having more people to talk to. At this point you are likely exhausting your network of people that can make warm referrals to you and you are starting to look elsewhere for a way to grow your suspect list to call. At this stage the focus should be on finding ways to build your list. This could be the time to start experimenting with some marketing tactics (scraping public lists, building lists from LinkedIn, attending shows where your prospects gather, sponsorships that get you access to a list, etc.).
At this stage it might be tempting to hire a sales person that already has a deep set of contacts in your target market. In my experience this is almost always a mistake for several reasons. First of all, you don’t understand your sales process deeply enough to teach it to someone else. Secondly, you may find that your understanding of exactly who you will sell to (both the target market and the key contacts in those businesses) is still very likely still evolving. Selling to warm contacts is exponentially easier than selling to people that have no connection to you and no reason at all to do you a favor and talk to you. In my experience you need to grind through Phase 2 for a while before you know what sort of sales people you might want and what sort of contacts might be valuable to you (if any — more on that later). A Phase 2 process typically looks like this:
In this phase you are getting pretty smart about who your best prospects are — meaning the folks that are the best suited to your solution, that understand your value proposition most easily, and close the fastest. You are also getting smart about how to find those people and connect with them. You are likely getting more sophistication in your marketing efforts and building bigger and bigger contact lists and at this point the biggest roadblock in your funnel is your own time to do calls and meetings, particularly initial calls with contacts that you haven’t spoken to yet.
Again, it would be tempting at this stage to simply hire someone to replace you in the sales process but again in my experience that would be a mistake. A better way to relieve this pressure is to take as much of the sales mechanics as possible off of your shoulders while leaving you in the process to do the hard stuff (key sales meetings, demos, closing). By this point you should be getting pretty smart about what a good prospect looks like. You should know what questions to ask early in your interactions with a prospect that would tell you if they are worth spending more time with or not. At this point adding someone to help you pre-qualify deals and help with the logistics of setting up sales meetings can free up a lot of your time while still letting you be involved in the key parts of selling that require your deeper expertise and experience. It’s generally much easier and lower risk to hire an inside business development rep/inside sales person (aside — the way we name these jobs is just plain stupid imo) than it is to hire a sales closer/account rep. Typically this person can be trained easily to reach out to prospects to ask a specific set of questions to qualify the prospect and set up sales meetings with the founder.
The Phase 3 process usually looks like this:
Once you have a process working with an inside sales person doing pre-qualification on deals and appointment setting, you will finally be ready to think about bringing on sales reps that can close deals. At this stage you have a deep understanding of who you are selling to, the stages a deal goes through before it closes, and how to pre-qualify a deal. Not only that you also have a nice machine running that is churning out a good volume of pre-qualified leads. This is the perfect time to start looking for someone that can replace you as the person who does the sales meetings, gives a demo, and works the deal until closing. At this stage you will know exactly the type of person you want, what skills they need and how to train them. An interesting thing as well about hiring a sales person at this point is that you won’t be tempted to over-value the connections and network a sales person brings with them. In my experience, when you have a good sales funnel working, those don’t matter nearly as much as the ability to build relationships with customers and close business. I have found that when I focused my hiring process on that (rather than let it be weighted in favor of leads the person might be able to bring to the table) the outcome was much, much better in the longer run.
Here’s what a Stage 4 process looks like:
Most of the mistakes I have seen (and made myself) in this evolution come from adding Account Managers/Sales closers too early in the process. By letting the sales process evolve slowly, you get the benefit of learning more at every stage and this will set you up to make better hires that are more likely to be successful in the longer term.

Be the first to respond.
This is a story of how I launched, marketed, grew and sold my first micro SaaS — HeadReach.
I’m sharing all the marketing frameworks and formulas that helped me do that on a shoestring budget…
I’m using the same strategies and frameworks for my new startup — Encharge.
Back in late 2016, we launched HeadReach, a sales tool for lead generation. It’s a SaaS that helps you find emails of people you want to sell to. Think of it as LinkedIn plus emails minus the high price tag.
In 3 months we grew the product to a bit shy of $2,000 in MRR and a few thousand users.
Just as we started growing, in February 2017 Google emailed us that they’re closing the Site Search API — the primary “technology” we use behind HeadReach to find leads.
Google didn’t close our product — we managed to scale back to a different 3rd party API. However, dropping that bomb was anything short of a sobering glass of cold water for us.
It’s not a sustainable business strategy to put all your eggs in one basket by relying on a single 3rd party API.
After the Google bomb, we tried to build our own proprietary tech. We put a hard and persistent fight with data scrappers but never figured out how to index data on a large enough scale without spending too much cash.
After exploring a myriad of possible alternatives, databases, and partners, we decided to put the project in zombie mode due to the technical difficulties.
Zombie mode — a walking dead project. When the product is operational, but you don’t actively work on it.
About a year later we approached LeadFuze, one of our competitors and overall amazing entrepreneurs, and we sold the HeadReach user base and marketing assets to them. They have solved that technical barrier and managed to build a sustainable business in the field, so it was just natural to sell to them.
Staying true to our core value of transparency, I’m going to share with you the entire HeadReach journey with all the triumphs and downfalls.
From an idea to the acquisition, this is how the HeadReach journey looked like time-wise.
The Y-axis displays actively paying customers. The X-axis is the timeframe in quarters.
Some lifecycle numbers and unit economics for HR:
The initial idea for HeadReach was very different from what the final tool became.
Being a content marketer, one day I said to myself that there should be a tool that generates marketing opportunities for each of your content pieces. Automagically!
Next day I was already working on validating this idea.
The idea:
HeadReach is an online tool that generates reliable outreach lists with targeted prospects and promotion opportunities.
Instead of building an application prototype I decided to focus on customer interactions as the shortest way to gain knowledge and validate the riskiest hypothesis.
I watched an interview with Rob Walling, co-founder of Drip, and one of his concepts, really stuck with me. If I had to paraphrase it was something like:
> A working software piece is not an MVP. It’s a prototype.
An MVP is more like:
The shortest route to the activity that generates the most knowledge for you and the most value to the customer.
At this point we wanted to test the biggest risk for the idea: would people care enough about this information to pay us money?
In other words, instead of building software that generates data automatically I had to create lists with the data manually. We took off everything unnecessary for our MVP and created the 1st ever version of HeadReach — a concierge service for outreach/promotion lists.
A friend of mine Karl , a creator of a popular marketing blog (and as of recently, co-founder of MRR media), suggested that I should make an outreach list for one of his posts. In exchange, I would receive the first testimonial for HeadReach.
I put together this list:
Also, I designed a simple landing page for the MVP with a single CTA.
Now as we had an example list and a working landing page, we had to decide what is our goal for this MVP.
For the HeadReach MVP, we agreed that 20 paying customers in 2 weeks is a great validation result.
A rule I still respect to these days:
Always define what the expected outcome of your marketing campaign is.
It has to be quantifiable and time-specific.
Good examples:
Bad examples:
For the MVP of HeadReach, I used something called a “quant-based marketing spreadsheet” or “hypothesis spreadsheet.” It looks something like that
You list all potential marketing channels, your expected results (visitors, CR, etc.) and then cross-reference your hypothesis with the real results and find out if your assumptions for the channel have been confirmed or not.
There are many other ways to track your marketing goals.
If you use a marketing automation software, make sure to check if it supports some sort of campaign goal tracking.
I’m currently using Autopilot’s Goals. A neat feature that allows you to track your target CR for a specific marketing journey.
You define what a converted user looks like by using user segments. For example, this could be “users that submit a survey” or “users who make a purchase.” You choose your target CR goal and the expected timeframe. Autopilot then tracks the CR for users moving through that journey (i.e., funnel) and tells you how you’re doing:
If you prefer to keep things simple, you can go analog and use a whiteboard.
We currently use a whiteboard to track our pre-launch marketing efforts at Encharge. On the left half of the board, you see the marketing column. Number of weeks, activity for the week, and achieved subscribers (our KPI) for the week.
In the first 24 hours of marketing the MVP we achieved:
As a side effect, one of the top SEO players (Nick Eubanks) hired me to create an outreach list for him which brought another $200.
People cared about this data!
3 channels:
Long messages and personalized videos work great with Facebook groups. This is the video that I posted to one of those groups:
For influencer marketing, I used a simple, custom-tailored message. Nothing fancy but it works wonders:
Hi Nick,
Thanks for accepting my friendship request. I’ve been reading a lot of your stuff on SeoNick. Haven’t got a chance to get to your eBook yet, but hopefully, will do that soon.
I’m just testing an idea for a tool that creates 1-click content promotion strategies. You can check it out here: headreach.com
Would love hearing your opinion on this if you have 2 minutes to check it out?
The goal of this tool is to make content outreach ridiculously easy. Imagine 1-click content promotion.
You simply chuck in your URL and — Huzzah! — You get thousands of outreach opportunities. Hours of painstaking list building transformed into a neat content strategy in seconds.
At the moment, the validation is all manual. I’m personally creating the list instead of an automated tool. You can see an example list here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xp0xEuv6uKhYOomn4ymC-XXzkK3nO22SXIpG0XVH04U/edit#gid=0
Let me know?
With some initial validation for HeadReach, we were confident enough to move forward with building a prototype for the tool.
A big mistake startup guys do at this stage is that they consider the validation process done and dusted. They seal their leads list, put it to the side and disappear in the shadows of their computer cave for a couple of months to code their new, uber innovative product. Wrong!
Customer development is a long and tough process. The purpose of the leads you’ve collected in the beginning is not to have a list for the sake of having a list. It’s to build a relationship with them and use them to guide your product creation.
Ask them questions, jump on calls with them, show them what you’re working on with wireframes and prototypes.
Here’s an email I used to send to all of the people that bought the list from HeadReach MVP phase:
Hey,
I’ll do my best to provide the 2nd list over the next week.
As I mentioned, we’re currently working on a tool that automates this list, and would be greatly helpful if you find few minutes to answer my questions below. We need SEO experts opinions!
1. What’s your biggest pain with doing outreach now?2. What did you find most valuable in the list?3. Was anything missing in the list that you wanted to see?4. Could please check out this concept screenshot of the tool we’re building, and let me know what you think — is there anything unclear with the interface on it?5. Would you pay $29 per list for a tool that generates the same quality of results as the manual list we made for you?
Thank you for your time!
It’s pretty straightforward. The idea is to keep the potential customers in the loop and identify what the #1 most important feature for them is.
At this stage, you should have a rough idea of whom you’re going to sell to.
Here are the buyer personas for Encharge (our new product):
Below are some of the fields I use to define personas, along with an example Encharge persona named Co-founder and CMO Colling:

and acquisition strategy
The personas will drastically change as you launch and grow your product, so think of them as a hypothesis and adapt them as you go.
Once you start getting some insights from potential customers, make sure to put everything in one place.
This is the Customer Development repository I currently use for collecting feedback for Encharge:
It’s an Airtable document, and by far I think it’s the best way to collect and organize feedback. It’s a database of your potential customers, their feedback and which persona they fall into.
Download a template of that document.
I recorded a quick video to show you how to use the template:
The repository has 5 tabs:
Thanks to a feature in Airtable called Links (or relationships), you can link different records across the repository. For example, you can easily keep track of all feedback sessions that have a specific feature or complained mentioned. Or all the people that you’ve interviewed that work in the same company. Or all people that match a particular buyer persona.
Another neat feature that I like is the ability to attach files to a specific record. (Something that Google Spreadsheet doesn’t have). I keep a full log of all things recorded — chat snapshots, audio recordings, files, etc. Airtable has seamless integrations with Google Drive and Dropbox, so that makes it even easier.
With some validation and customer feedback collected, we started to work on the product.
I wrote a massive eBook on outreach marketing that I used to collect pre-launch leads for HeadReach. It’s quite similar to what I’m currently doing to grow the pre-launch audience of Encharge.
With the HeadReach acquisition, LeadFuze now owns the rights to this eBook so you can download it from their website. Where you can also see the landing page, I used to generate pre-launch leads.
The eBook helped us generate quite a lot of buzz and some pre-launch traction:
Unfortunately, we never really got to leverage social media subscribers at HeadReach, but the pre-launch subscribers were an early driving force for HeadReach.
You can copy a lot of the marketing tactics we used for the eBook launch to kickstart pretty much any email list.
We did a few things right:
I created 2 pre-launch landing pages — one landing page for the eBook and another one for the HeadReach product itself.
This was the landing page for the product:
And the one for the eBook (dissected):
The second thing we did great was what I call a Blitz marketing campaign.
Blitz marketing — a very intensive marketing campaign in a short period of time.
While methods like SEO rely on slow, methodical growth, blitz marketing is all about going heavy in a short period of time. For the HeadReach pre-launch that was 2–3 weeks.
With Blitz marketing, you can also be more liberal in the ways you share your content. Since you aim to get the best possible results in the shortest period, it’s entirely OK to re-publish the same content on multiple channels and outlets even without a canonical link (something that would be considered a heresy in the SEO world.)
Some of the channels that we hit hard at the pre-launch included:
And the marketings tactics we executed:
For the eBook, we used a tool called Gleam. Gleam helps you run giveaways, rewards, and other cool widgets to help you collect more emails.
While their focus is giveaways, they have an app called “rewards” which is a more advanced social payment platform. Think “Pay with Tweet” but with much, much more options and flexibility.
My initial thought was that we should ask for:
A whole 4-step sign-up process to get the eBook. I was wrong. Only about 3% of all users were able to reach the latest step and download the eBook. Most of them were giving up after the 3rd step.
We took off the referral step asking only for an email, a tweet and a follow. Conversions went up drastically to about 8% of the people completing all actions.
You can also look into more powerful tools for viral sharing like UpViral. I’d recommend UpViral for more advanced marketers or people that do giveaways on a regular basis. It offers some power features like sweepstakes, landing page and email A/b testing, lead fraud detection, one-click email sign-ups (think UTM links), advanced reporting and a lot more.
If you don’t know already — Redditors hate you. They’re very sensitive to any kind of promotion and are looking for the smallest opportunity to ridicule your manhood with sarcastic comments.
Here’s how to do Reddit better:
Using these steps, I managed to beat my personal record on Reddit and got a post with over a 100 upvotes, 50 comments, and a solid 9.40% email subscribers CR.
I hadn’t designed a Medium strategy. I just knew that the post would perform well on Medium because it was performing so well on Reddit already.
At the time, I had 600 followers on Medium because I had connected my Twitter account with my Medium account.
My first Medium article got almost a thousand reads and brought a few hundred visits to HeadReach with an exciting email subscriber’s CR of 24.64%
If I have to do this exercise again, I’ll use a free tool called Upscribe. It allows you to embed email forms into your Medium posts. Unfortunately, Upscribe didn’t exist at the time of this story.
By the time, I launched my outreach marketing eBook on ProductHunt I had already collected about 400–500 email subscribers.
I sent them a quick email to review my eBook on PH (instead of upvoting it):
Books get much less attention on PH than products, but that’s also a good opportunity to stand out and become a number one book for the day.
This was a neat move that generated a couple of hundred pre-launch leads more.
Posting HeadReach on BetaList resulted in a few hundred subscribers for the HeadReach beta.
These days I’m not a huge fan of BetaList. We’ve submitted a couple of other products on their site but never really got any good leads from there. It felt like most of the leads are curious startup guys who don’t have a business. Unless your audience is startup guys, you might be better looking to pre-launch somewhere else.
Facebook was the second channel with the most views to the HeadReach website when pre-launching. Majority of the Facebook views came through Facebook groups.
Facebook is a channel that I’ll be heavily relying on when pre-launching Encharge, as well.
After the traction from our pre-launch campaign — about 1500 emails in total at 25% landing page CR — we got down to developing the product.
My co-founder put together a development roadmap:
We spent the next few months trying to build the tool we promised.
April was spent mostly looking for someone to help us with development. Finding a suitable developer in our country proved to be quite hard. We even tried UpWork.
Tip on using UpWork when hiring people: make sure to avoid agencies. Freelancers are generally cheaper than agencies, but often it’s hard to tell them apart on UpWork.
In the end, we managed to attract my former co-founder who is an also great dev, although with a colorful personality that I’d describe as anything short of scandalous. Without diving into too many details, I’ll say that he was living in a religious sect at the time of this story.
Mistake from that month: Not having enough focus
We were building too many features. Even on that roadmap, you can see a whole set of 6 features. We should’ve focused merely on feature #1.
Expenses from that month:
$101
Mostly marketing expenses for marketing the eBook and having the email list:
May was a bit weird. We’ve been 1 month into building HeadReach, but my co-founder was still running our previous business.
Although we had saved $10k for getting HeadReach of the ground, we were afraid to close our previous business, yet.
Juggling between 2 projects is tough. If I had to re-do this again, I would’ve turned off the light of our previous business much sooner.
Expenses for that month:
$683. The first expense for a development contractor.
We dedicated June to VC and angel investors. We were pondering with the idea of finding external funding to help us with developing HeadReach faster.
We got rejected by 10 different accelerators.
I won’t go into too much detail as this topic is worthy of having its own article, but investors weren’t a good match for us anyway. We pretty much lost that month going for the wrong thing.
Expenses for the month:
$481
With a demo video of our scrappy prototype, I started showing HeadReach to a small number of early adopters, the loudest and most vested ones. I didn’t want to blast the whole email list as we weren’t sure if what we’re showing is relevant. We didn’t have an account or billing systems set up, but I was fiercely doing my best to pre-sell the product.
Here’s the message that I used to try to pre-sell the tool:
HeadReach UPDATE + SPECIAL DEAL for Outreach Champions
Hi guys,
Kalo here. We’ve been very busy working on our outreach lists tool and finally have the 1st feature ready. Still very early development, but as part of this group I wanted to show you first what we’ve got.
With Page Mentions we’re able to show all people related to a website domain/company that you referred to in an article or a site.
Check out example results for “nma.vc” — http://headreach.info/web/site/submitkeyword/?id=5247747C
This is just the 1st module from 25 that are in our development pipeline and we’re still expanding on it — expecting to deliver x3 times more results.
— — SPECIAL DEAL — — Type in the comments below 1 URL for a blog post or a website and I’d run it through our tool and send you back the results via PM or email completely free.
If you like the results, you can order a pre-paid package for 5, 10 or 15 searches.
Page Mentions Pre-Package #1 –5 searches — $50 Page Mentions Pre-Package #2 –10 searches — $90 Page Mentions Pre-Package #3 –15 searches — $130
These are early supporter’s packages and come with 15% LIFETIME discount once we launch the tool publicly in September.
You can use the searches right away. Just send us the URLs that you’d like us to run through the tool. Or keep your searches for later once we build the others features. (Next module in the pipeline is Influencers and will be ready by the end of next week).
— — HOW TO ORDER — -Send the money to PayPal email “email protected” with a note about the package you’re ordering along with the URLs you’d like us to search. Or get in touch with me here via PM or email protected
If you’re not happy with the results, we offer 100% money back guarantee.
By ordering a package, you will support us a bootstrapped startup and help us cover expenses for our servers and paid services we use right now to show you these accurate results.
DISCLAIMERThis deal is first come first served deal, and it’s extremely limited!
PLEASE do not feel angry at us if we’re not able to take your order. We’re working uber hard to make this tool the best outreach marketing tool out there, but this comes at a price — we’re dealing with heavy server performance, complex bugs and pretty much everything that comes with a bootstrapped software startup. Let me know your thoughts?
Make sure to select HD for the video!
Unfortunately, we never obtained the fruition of our hopes with our pre-selling efforts. We didn’t get a single pre-order.
With our pre-selling hopes crushed we got back to building the product.
If you don’t have your product ready for demoing you can use a tool like Adobe XD, Sketch or Marvel to simulate an interactive software from your static designs. Marvel is the easiest one to use if you’re not a web designer. You can create visual prototypes such as this one — a prototype we made for one of our ideas. Although a bit out of the skill scope for a marketer, I highly encourage you to get the hang of one visual software, it would save you back and forth with your team’s designer.
From March 2016 up until our public launch in November 2016 we were building the product. And when I say building, I mean we spent 80% of our time figuring out HOW to build it.
Lead generation is a tough field to get into. Scrapping large volumes of data from locked-in sources like LinkedIn is reserved only for the savviest and most financially favored companies. We were neither of those.
We were forced to make a significant product or “solution” pivot — we had to dramatically limit the feature set of HeadReach to only finding contacts of prospects. That was the only way we could get this thing off the ground.
A pivot is a “structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth.”
Types of pivots:
You can read more about the startup pivot pyramid here.
In September we had a product demo for HeadReach, but it was so bad that even the core features were barely working.
To make matters worse, at this point our pre-launch leads were getting very cold. If there is one thing I learned about nurturing leads is that you should keep them warm by sending at least one email every week or more often.
No communication with your leads in 3 months, and you can consider your email list dead.
To figure out how to position our future beta and better segment and orchestrate the beta invites, we’ve put together a survey. A great thing about the surveys in Iterate is they record the answers even when someone leaves the survey un-submitted.
The survey was also helpful to identify sales messages to use in my communication with potential clients. I’m literary using answers from the survey in the copy of my landing pages.
For example:
Would become our final USP:
Why think about sales copy when your clients can write it up for you?
Without wasting too much time I showed the first demo of the tool and emailed 15 early adopters:
The message I sent with that video:
HeadReach Update
I’m showing the #1 requested feature — a prospecting tool that will help you find targeted people for outreach with real emails and social profiles in seconds. Click Play to watch 5 minutes video of our new feature.
As SEOs and content marketers we know: Finding the right people to reach out to is a hell of a lot of work!
It takes way too much time to search for relevant people.
Once you’ve identified them, it can then take even more time tracking down their valid email address and social profiles.
Then you have to find something unique about each lead to add relevancy to your contact with that person. That’s why we’re creating the fastest way to find the right people for outreach without the usual hassle.
NEW FEATURE: Save up to 20 minutes per lead search with our People Finder.
Find the right people to reach out to with a single click. Get direct access to anybody’s verified email, social profiles, job position, and biography.
Or:
SCAN A BLOG POST and get all relevant contacts you need to start your outreach campaign and promote your content by reaching the right people
Example results for http://fortunelords.com/start-a-blog/--> http://headreach.info/web/prospector/post/5246724G
If you want us to test the search for you drop me a name, company, domain or post URL and I’ll send you the results back.
I’m looking for some feedback. What are your thoughts on our People Finder feature?
Almost 5 months after we decided to develop HeadReach and we finally received some good feedback and some strong signals from people interested in buying the tool:
Hi Kalo
Thanks for this. I really liked that your tool has a lot of depth.
Getting the photo, email, position, and social media profiles — tons of data for a single site. So we can easily figure out the right decision maker.
Don’t bother about running the remaining searches for now. Focus on getting the product ready soon. Since you took some time to respond, we completely the outreach activity for that assignment.
But if we had headreach, we would have saved a ton of time. So the value is clearly there with headreach.
All the best with the development work going on. I’m really excited to try it when its ready.
Thanks
We continued developing the product.
Around October 2016 we had some sort of a working closed beta with a basic account system set up on WordPress and WooCommerce. Pretty unconventional setup for a SaaS but it was the fastest way to market for us. As I look back, I wouldn’t recommend it unless it’s necessary.
I’ve sent an invite to a small number of selected early adopters asking them to try the tool.
Responses came in quite fast.
It wasn’t what we expected. People were divided evenly between two camps, both with equally bad feedback.
The first group complained that the software was simply not working, which was not a surprise. That first version of HeadReach was terribly buggy and under-developed.
The second group was disappointed that the product is not what we’ve promised in the pre-launch campaign. I.e., not very happy with our solution pivot.
It was terrible. Our closed beta was a fail. No one became a paying subscriber.
We didn’t know what we got wrong.
With 1500+ leads and zero paying customers for our Beta, we were really up the creek. We were desperate for a breakthrough in our market or the technology.
Around October 2016, I found out that we can use one of Google’s APIs — Google Site Search to improve our product significantly.
Later that API became a core part of our infrastructure. So much so that HeadReach would not work if it wasn’t for GSS.
We spent the next 2 months rebuilding the product from the ground up using the newly found technology in order to make our product more “acceptable” for usage. My co-founder was doing his full-time job at day and moonlighting at night building HeadReach.
We finally launched HeadReach publicly around the middle of November.
I still picture how we were watching the live session recording of our soon-to-be first paying customer, stalking him as he jumps between the billing page and the rest of the pages until he finally subscribed to a $49/mo plan.
Our approach to getting the first 5 customers was conceptually straightforward but damn hard to execute. Yes, I feel you, it’s not marketing automation, but sometimes you have to do things the hard way. You know, PG’s iconic essay on doing things that don’t scale.
I was reaching out with personal video messages to some of our pre-launch subscribers. If you remember the segmentation survey we did back in September, I was using that information to craft personalized messages for each subscriber. Recording your screen with CloudApp is easy. Make sure to show your face, too.
For example:
In total, I’ve recorded more than 2 hours of personalized videos in the first week of the public HeadReach launch.
Apart from that, we were offering a bulky 50% lifetime discount. It’s not an amazing long-term strategy, especially when you have marginal costs but it’s a pretty decent motivation booster to help you get off the ground.
The email:
And the personal video:
His response:
In the first month of launching the product, we very much relied on Inspectlet to proactively track what our users are doing and where they get stuck. Since we didn’t have that many users, it was relatively easy to follow what each one of them did in the app.
As soon as I saw someone experiencing an issue with the app, I was recording a personal video for them with hands-on instructions. This in combination with the early adopter discount was a factor in acquiring our first 10 customers.
Tip: Install Inspectlet or FullStory and allocate at least 20 to 30% of your time to proactive support until you get your first couple of dozen paying customers. Think of it as customer success and customer development all-in-one.
Apart from the personal emails, I had prepared a simple 3-email launch sequence for the whole email list.
Email 1
The first email was a generic “we’re live type of email.”
Email 2
The second email was a value-based email describing the possible use cases for the HeadReach tool.
Email 3
The 3rd email was a promotion follow-up with a scarcity element.
I’m a huge fan of Andrew Warner from Mixergy — one of the most influential people in the startup community.
As I was lurking through the premium Mixergy Facebook group I stumbled upon this gem:
A list of the tools that Andrew is paying for to run Mixergy. You can notice RocketReach, one of our direct competitors.
I wasn’t mopping around for too long and went straightaway for the pitch:
With the green light from Andrew, I sent him and his team an email:
And the video:
Onboarding the Mixergy team, wasn’t all a smooth sailing. I had to follow-up twice. When they finally signed up, I had to do a lot of manual prospecting for them. Andrew’s VA telling me which person she needs, and me doing whatever it takes to find the email including a lot of Googling, using other tools and so on.
All things considered, this was a superb onboarding experience which let to Andrew writing a testimonial and later hunting HeadReach on ProductHunt (win, win, win).
The beginning of 2017 was pretty good for HeadReach. The traffic to our site was slowly but steadily growing, and we were converting about 10 to 20% of that traffic to trials.
A big thing for growing our cold traffic was guest posting.
As much as I love SEO, when it comes to HeadReach, I never did link building and guest posting for the SEO juice. It was all about getting traffic. Quick.
Here’s how to do link building for traffic right:
There are a few ways to identify great guest posting/link building opportunities:
1) Google for top-level seed keywords and prospect the top 10 articles. Those articles get huge volumes of traffic. For HeadReach that was “find email address.”
2) Google for competitor round-ups. Lists of products or services in your category. For HeadReach this meant lists of sales tools. Ask them to feature your tool and make sure to give them a demo of how you stack up against the rest of the guys in the list.
3) Find dead competitors and do the “broken link” outreach.
We had an old competitor named Emailbreaker that has been shut down for quite a while. I used the Backlink Watch tool to find pages that contain active links to the now-closed Emailbreaker software.
Then using HeadReach (of course) to find the person in charge of the post or page that has the broken backlink, I emailed them with a suggestion to swap the broken link with one to HeadReach.
This email helped us acquire a link in the Yesware article which became our number 1 traffic source.
Although, the conversion rate from visitor to trial is not spectacular from a top of the funnel article with an unqualified audience (about 0.5% compared to the platform-wide CR of 3.5% for HR) it’s an excellent source for brand awareness, and generally the significant traffic volume makes up for the low CR.
Around January 2017 we were generating about $1k in MRR.
Based on customer feedback we decided to pivot the product towards a sales audience.
Not the easiest decision we made. The sales field is exceptionally saturated — dozens of direct competitors and hundreds of substitutes and alternatives.
Fortunately, we handled that well, and the pivot didn’t lead to a reduction in CR in any of the customer journey stages. Despite increasing the friction on our signup process by asking for a company email and phone number.
Contrary to the popular belief of going niche, for us entering a horizontal market was ultimately a smart decision that exposed us to more opportunities and made our marketing efforts easier.
Within that period we also launched on ProductHunt.
ProductHunt is an excellent source of early adopters and potential paying customers.
Now, I won’t get into too much detail of how to execute a successful ProductHunt launch. However, I can summarize a few key points:
We managed to acquire about a dozen paying customers in the first week or so after our PH submission. Also, PH was major traffic and lead source in the months to come.
With leads coming in from our brand new traffic from ProductHunt and all the guest posts, we had to put our heads down on the next stage of our customer funnel — the nurturing phase.
79% of marketing leads never convert to sales. Lack of lead nurturing is the common cause for poor performance.
According to MarketingSherpa.
It doesn’t matter if that number is lower or higher for your business. The non-negotiable fact is that for the nurturing stage of your funnel you must have at least 2 type of marketing campaigns:
These two campaigns are the bare minimum.
Let’s dive in on how we executed these two campaigns at HeadReach.
We pushed every new subscriber that registers for HeadReach to a simple time-based broadcast email sequence. The purpose of this sequence was to provide as much value as possible and educate the potential customers on the possible use cases for the tool.
The other sequence we built was a behavior-based email campaign. We used API triggers from HeadReach to trigger different emails in ActiveCampaign.
For example:
Behavior-based emails are a super powerful way to convert your leads into paying customers by sending the right communication at the right time.
Around February 2017 things were looking up for our micro-SaaS.
We managed to grow to a few thousand customers and about $2k in MRR with 0 spending on marketing and CAC.
I’ve been primarily focused on the marketing strategies that have already worked of us — link building, writing guest posts and making partnerships with lateral software tools in the sales field.
I got HeadReach featured on a number of sales outlets like the Close.io blog, RecruitingTools.com, a number of Medium publications and others.
We also saw some word-of-mouth organic growth. More and more people started mentioning the HeadReach tool when talking about automating sales and prospecting. Exactly what we wanted.
I fired any freelance clients that I had at the time to be able to work full-time on HeadReach. I was waking up at 5 AM and keeping myself intentionally full with marketing activities until the late hours of the afternoon.
Things were looking good.
It was all good and optimistic until one day my co-founder Dany forwarded me an email from Google.
The subject line was:
“Attn: Legal department”
You do not want to receive an email from Google with that subject line.
At first I was like “Oh…here we go, Google’s trying to shut us down because we use them to index protected data.” (Not our first time we did something grey-ish through the Google systems.)
When I saw the full email, it was a bit worse than that:
They were closing their search API. It wasn’t a special treatment for us. The search API was going down for everyone.
To give you some context without boring you to death with technical details about this API:
The chief technology we based HeadReach on was the Google Site Search (GSS) API. Through that API we pull data from sources like LinkedIn. In combination with a few other APIs and our in-house algorithms we were able to provide one of the complete lead databases without investing ginormous lumps of cash for infrastructure, crawling, servers, etc.
We had 2 options
Point 1 was much easier to execute but not very viable long-term.
The email Google dropped on us was like a sobering glass of cold water. We quickly realized we’re building a house of cards. Giving up ourselves entirely to the mercy of the big G.
Our goal was to create a sustainable lifestyle business. However, building a proprietary scrapping technology was not something we had intended on our roadmap for the next 12 to 18 months.
We decided that we’ll give it a go and see if we can build something on our own.
The period between March and July 2017 was quite agonizing for us.
We had to figure out a very tough tech challenge — how to index hundreds of million of pages on a shoestring budget. To be precise, we had to crawl about 200 millions pages each month.
We spent a few months learning scrapping, talking to different experts in the field, discussing partnerships with potential data sources and so forth.
Despite putting a hard and persistent battle, we never really managed to get our crawler to be able to scrape such large volumes of protected data without breaking the bank.
All things considered, I’m super happy about spending the time on this challenge. I learned I could be resourceful beyond what my skills limit me.
After a few months of tiring battle with tech-related issues, we decided that we’re going to pull the plug on HeadReach and put it in sunset mode. We didn’t want to invest time and resources in a product that doesn’t have long-term potential, even if it showed some good initial traction.
Not an easy decision but I still believe it was the right one.
HeadReach was operational up until the summer of this year. Thanks to the marketing automation systems that we had in place, the site was still generating new visits, trials and paying customers although slightly declining with the time.
After almost a year of running in zombie mode (live but not actively developed) we wanted to put closure on the project and approached one of our competitors.
After some back and forth, we agreed to sell the user base and marketing assets to LeadFuze which ultimately put an end to our startup journey with HeadReach.
I can’t disclose the acquisition price, but I’d say that selling HeadReach was much better than killing it in the shadows.
After a short retreat from the startup scene and flirting with a few unsuccessful product ideas, we’re finally back on track working on our next big thing.

I recently released Part 1 results of the annual SaaS Survey which shared data and insights on growth rates, go-to-market trends and cost structure. A new highlight in Part 1 of this year’s results includes data on balancing growth and profitability in SaaS companies, commonly known as The Rule of 40%.
This post covers Part 2 of the results, which dives into:
We’ve also published the forEntrepreneurs 2016 SaaS Survey Infographic! The infographic pulls together major takeaways from the SaaS Survey and ties in advice for founders on relevant metrics.
67% of participants use third parties predominantly (3/4 of which was AWS). Expectations for the future show little change as third party application delivery continues to gain popularity. The trend toward using third party public cloud is huge (mostly AWS). Self managed is down from 37% last year to 33% this year and the percentage planning to use AWS three years from now increased from 44% last year to 64% this year.
When filtered by company size, smaller respondents reported more frequent use of third-party providers as their primary application delivery method, while the largest companies were more likely to use self-managed servers.
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
Median subscription gross margins did not appear to vary much when filtered by SaaS application delivery method (note that Salesforce data is sparse).
This year’s results appear somewhat counterintuitive. Larger companies’ accounting shows operating costs as a greater percentage of revenue.
For data on cost structure and “The Rule of 40%”, see Part 1 of the survey results.
The median annual contract size (subscription component only) for the group was $25K per year. These results are somewhat above the previous survey medians of $21K, $21K, $20K in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The phenomenon of longer contract terms for larger contracts is pretty clear. Companies in the “elephant hunter” group are less aggressively booking super long-term contracts. Respondents with >$250K median ACV book nearly 25% of their contracts at 3 years or longer (down from 35% in the 2015 group).
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
Median annual gross dollar churn (without the benefit of upsells) is ~8%. This result is comparable to past survey results (7% in 2015, 6% in 2014, 8% in 2013).
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
As with unit churn, companies with longer contracts (2+ years) tend to report lower annual dollar churn. Companies with shorter contracts (under 2 years) saw increased dollar churn compared to last year; contracts 2 years or longer were relatively consistent with prior survey results.
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
By definition, non-renewal rates are higher than gross dollar churn rates. However, it is interesting to see that the non-renewal rates are also higher for shorter duration contracts.
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
As contract sizes increase, gross dollar churn consistently trends downwards (presumably related to longer contract terms). This year’s results were largely consistent with last year’s. However, churn trended up markedly for the smaller size contract groups (<$5K median ACV).
“How much do you expect your ACV from existing customers to change, including the effect of both churn and upsells?”(1)
The median annual net dollar retention rate, including churn and the benefit of upsells, is 102%. The result does not change materially when removing the smallest companies (<$2.5MM in revenue) form the group. These results are largely consistent with the past two years’ results (2015: 104% and 2014: 103%).
In other posts on forEntrepreneurs, I have referred to the situation where you have a greater 100% net dollar retention as “negative churn”. For those interested in learning out to achieve negative churn, this slide deck may be of interest: The Key Drivers for SaaS Success.
The 2016 respondents have less revenue traction per dollars raised than previous years’ groups.
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
“When do you typically begin recognizing subscription revenues on a new contract with a new customer?”
Approximately 53% of respondents indicated they begin recognition very soon (within a week or two) after signing new contracts. It’s interesting to see that many companies with significant services were still able to start subscription revenue recognition quickly. A greater percentage of companies are recognizing subscription revenue “a few months or more after signing”; 25% this year vs. 17% last year.
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
“How do you recognize sales commission costs (deferred or recognized up-front)?”
We also inquired as to the recognition of sales commission costs. We found ~3/4 of respondents indicate that they recognize costs up-front. Compared to previous surveys, there is a slight shift toward up-front recognition vs. 72% last year.
The benefit of recognizing revenue in a deferred manner is that you avoid missing your expense and profitability goals when you have a large bookings quarter. The downside is that it is more complex to maintain the commission tracking system.

This article will go into detail on what you need to automate in order for your SaaS company to have a functional subscription billing solution.
One of the problems SaaS companies face when selling subscriptions is connecting their application to a billing process.
Some of the things that are need to be considered are:
The challenge in managing these billing processes is handling these events, such as restricting access to an application when a trial expires or if there no longer has a valid funding source attached to an account.
The process a customer goes through when doing business with a SaaS company can be broken down into the five events above. Managing these events is the key to integrating a billing system with a SaaS.
This is the first stage in the journey a user takes with a subscription. In this step, the customer has just signed up for a subscription which needs to trigger an automated process.
The process generally looks something like this:
From a DevOps perspective, these are considered “Day 1” operations. These are the steps that a service goes through after being requested in order to be considered “provisioned,” such as installation and configurations of software.
In the trialing stage, a customer has subscribed to a service, but is not paying until their trial expires.
Approximately 75% of SaaS companies offer free trials. Although free trials are almost guaranteed to bring you more paying customers, one of the trickier things about offering them is deciding what happens when a trial expires without a customer adding a funding source.
At this stage of the service lifecycle, a company will need to build logic around trials which will, upon expiration, restrict access to an application and alert the customer that they need to pay.
Many SaaS businesses support multiple tiers of service. If a customer pays a premium, they have access to additional features. This is considered a “Day 2” operation, actions which can be taken after a service has been provisioned which affect the end user.
Generally, it follows the pattern below:
While this usually takes the form of strict pricing tiers, sometimes customers pay “per user per month” or have “thresholds” which if passed will trigger higher rates.
Inevitably, there will be cancellations of subscriptions, also called churning. The steps which occur in order to fulfill a cancellation go as follows:
Reaching out to your former customers after they have cancelled will also require some sort of process. It’s recommended that cancellation triggers a process which sends an automated email to the former customer, perhaps with an attempt to recover the customer or a feedback survey to see what reasons they may have had for canceling.
When a former customer decides to return after canceling, a company can’t just go through the original process to subscribe them as a new customer — they need to reactivate the previously terminated access so that they retain all their former data. This process can be described in three steps:
Some complex scenarios might include limited time discount codes for resubscribers, a free trial, or part of another service as part of a combo deal.
The key to selling software-as-a-service is connecting software to a billing system that can support the lifecycle I just described. Being able to automate this process is a boon to businesses, since manual processes are one of the biggest barriers to scaling.

Even though an entire generation has grown up with the internet at their fingertips, it’s important to remember that digital journalism is still in its infancy. It has only been 26 years since the world’s first website and server went live at CERN on December 20, 1990.
For context, the Lumiere brothers presented the first motion picture film in 1895. The 50-second film showing a train steamrolling towards the camera was an engineering marvel, but 26 years later the world was just entering the Charlie Chaplin era of motion pictures.
Sound in cinema would take an additional five years, virtual reality headsets another 115.
I began thinking about this longer time frame and the evolution of journalism five years ago when I co-wrote an article in Nieman Reports with Harvard Business School Professor, Clayton M. Christensen, and HBS fellow James Allworth that applied Christensen’s often-cited theory of disruption to the business of traditional journalism.
The article, Breaking News, was a look at how traditional journalism had been disrupted by the internet.
I’m thankful that the article has held up well over time but my one regret is that we didn’t consider how digital native journalism, or specifically sites that were born out of the disruption of traditional media, had themselves been disrupted, and what could lie ahead for these digital-only publishers. This article attempts to tackle that question through my own interpretation of disruption theory.
During the first quarter century of the commercial internet, digital journalism has already gone through three eras: the portal years, the search years, and the social years. Each era advanced storytelling and presented new revenue streams, but I would argue that digital journalism is now entering its most exciting period yet.
Think of this as the stories as a service era, where journalism will be paid for by readers, for readers.
This period, for the first time in modern history, will be characterized by readers building and improving journalism. Organizations that recognize the opportunity of this new period can realize journalistic independence, produce quality reporting, and build reliable revenue streams, preparing them for whatever the next quarter century may hold.
Before I walk through each era of digital journalism, I’ll provide a brief explanation of the two most relevant Christensen theories that apply: Disruption Theory and Integration vs. Modularity.
First, a brief primer on Christensen’s disruption theory excerpted from our 2012 article:
Disruption theory argues that a consistent pattern repeats itself from industry to industry. New entrants to a field establish a foothold at the low end and move up the value network—eating away at the customer base of incumbents—by using a scalable advantage and typically entering the market with a lower-margin profit formula.
It happened with Japanese automakers: They started with cheap subcompacts that were widely considered a joke. Now they make Lexuses that challenge the best of what Europe can offer.
It happened in the steel industry, where minimills began as a cheap, lower-quality alternative to established integrated mills, then moved their way up, pushing aside the industry’s giants.
In Breaking News, we argued that newcomers like The Huffington Post and Buzzfeed were disrupting traditional publishers by delivering a product that was faster and more personalized than that provided by the bigger, more established news organizations.
Traditional news organizations used technology to create sustaining innovations that made their products more efficient to produce and consume, such as creating digital newsrooms and products for WSJ.com or NYTimes.com.
New entrants, however, used technology to create disruptive innovations that built new markets for their products.
For example, The Huffington Post built their newsroom for search engine optimization, and later, Buzzfeed did the same to optimize for social media.
Companies move up the disruption curve in the pursuit of profits. In the early stages of a company’s life cycle, when it’s at the bottom of the disruption curve and just building a new product with new technology, it needs to own its product’s value chain in order for the technology to be good enough for the consumer.
For traditional publishers, for example, owning all aspects of the value chain meant controlling the newsgathering, distribution, and selling of their journalism.
These integrated value chain companies are not yet vulnerable to disruption.
At some point, companies exceed what the consumer really needs from that product. When this happens, a company has “overshot” the needs of its consumers. Meanwhile, improved technology means it is more cost effective for a company to outsource portions of its value chain.
This modular value chain exposes the company to fragmentation, leaving it vulnerable to disruptive competitors who can pick apart different parts of their business.
Each of these cycles of disruption presents perils for some and opportunities for others. When the commercial internet arrived in the form of the World Wide Web, it was perilous for traditional publishers who viewed it only as a sustaining innovation, but an opportunity for those who saw it as a disruptive one.
Enter the online portals.
The first wave of digital journalism disruptors were the portals. This was a time of integrated value chains, where those owning the bandwidth, software, and the dial-up servers also controlled the digital journalism landscape.
These new entrants included MSN, AOL, and CompuServe, whose revenues were tied directly to their display advertising. If you wanted to advertise next to online news, you needed to buy space on a portal. CPMs were high, inventory was low, and digital advertising ruled the day. These digital platforms closely resembled their print counterparts by being end-to-end publishing businesses who gathered, aggregated, published, and distributed their journalism.
Second, were the search years. This was a time of discovery and modularity with search engines like Google generating referral traffic to a new set of journalism sites that understood how to optimize for search.
These were sustaining innovations in digital journalism, with The Huffington Post being the most celebrated, and they understood how articles answering questions like, “What time is the Super Bowl?” would drive traffic and ad dollars. By this time, traditional publishers had caught on and so there were also an abundance of free legacy and city-branded sites like sfgate.com and Philly.com that also relied on advertising revenue.
In the early years, CPMs were high and scale was rewarded, but by the end of the era, new advertising technologies like programmatic real-time bidding, put severe downward pressure on the value of CPMs. “Replacing print dollars with digital pennies,” was a common refrain from publishers who recognized that they couldn’t achieve enough scale to replace their traditional revenues through digital advertising alone.
This was a time when digital platforms also began to overshoot the needs of their consumers, resulting in the early days of market fragmentation. Think of unpaid writers, articles written for their headline optimization, pop-up advertising, 75 page photo galleries, article pagination, unmoderated forums and commenting sections, and its not hard to see how customers were no longer being served.
Next, digital journalism entered its third phase: the social era. During this time the market fragmented even further. Thanks to social networks, particularly Facebook, journalism was optimized for viral buzz and “click-bait” entered common parlance.
It was best exemplified by the rise of Buzzfeed and Upworthy, but also by low-end sponsored content sites like Taboola and Outbrain, all of whom understood that the best way to generate ad revenue was through custom-sponsored advertising and creative campaigns targeting specific audiences, instead of ad impressions at scale.
Digital journalism had now failed to meet the needs of consumers both in content and in user-experience. At the height of the social era, stories were designed for click-ability and impressions, not readability or loyalty.
As digital journalism moved from one era to the next, each site that was born from a respective era accumulated legacy infrastructure and resourcing in advertising technology and workflows that made it more difficult for those sites to respond to the new upstarts born out of the next phase. MSN was able to move from the portal years to the SEO years but they were not able to effectively shift to the social years. AOL was able to make the shift into the SEO years by purchasing The Huffington Post, but couldn’t quite adapt to the social years.
That brings us to the present. After twenty years of modularity and accelerated technological progress, where virtually everyone with a blog has the opportunity to become a digital publisher, digital journalism has overshot the needs of its consumers. These consumers are now living through a surplus of news and information, including fake news, that has eroded trust and credibility. They are on a flight towards quality and community. Digital journalism has been commoditized, creating new market opportunities at the bottom of a new disruption curve that is not yet “good enough.”
The technological revolution upending digital journalism and creating this disruptive new market includes the emergence of machine learning, predictive analytics and a targeted understanding of user behavior. These data tools have given organizations that own their entire value chain a leg-up over their competitors. Digital journalism has gone from a modular phase of disruption to a new phase of integration that relies on owning the relationship with your reader through data.
There is a term for organizations that rely on subscription revenues to build and improve their software: SaaS or Software as a Service. This might be a way to define the phase digital journalism is now entering, one that relies on consumers to build and improve the journalism, called SaaS or Stories as a Service.
In part one of this series, I argued that owning the platforms was less important than owning the story. The same principle applies here: Those who own the relationship between the story and the reader will be at a distinct advantage over those who own the production and platforms of newsgathering and distribution.
This journalism era, paid for by readers, for readers, will result in quality journalism, trustworthiness, and the building of new communities. For almost a century, journalism — in all its forms — has been funded by advertisers, and not by consumers. By having readers pay for their own journalism and using the data publishers have to listen to what their readers really want, news organizations can focus on accountability metrics like loyalty, retention, and churn that resemble SaaS instead of a singular focus on CPMs.
Perhaps ironically, this has created an opportunity for traditional publishers to disrupt the earliest digital startups that were born out of the portal and search eras. If print publishers can contain their legacy cost structures and offer a unified editorial vision they could be at a distinct advantage in harnessing their existing subscriber relationships.
An organization that has successfully adapted this approach is the Financial Times. Robin Goad, their head of customer analytics outlined last Spring how the FT had built a formula that accurately predicted whether someone would subscribe or cancel their FT.com subscription. It was only possible for the FT to build the “RFV Formula” as it is now known [Recency x Frequency x Volume] because they owned their customer data.
Consumers have always subscribed to ‘content,’ whether it was a newspaper, magazine, or cable television subscription, but increasingly, as Om Malik outlined in this post, consumers are willing to pay for digital content. Netflix has 93 million subscribers, Spotify 40 million, Apple Music 20 million, Hulu 12 million, and HBO NOW 2 million.
This is true for traditional publishers too. For example, the New York Times and The Financial Times are increasingly replacing their digital advertising revenues with digital subscription revenues.
Most of the publications seeing success with digital subscriptions rely on quality over quantity journalism. It is likely not a mass media but a niche media focus.
For example, Skift — a travel industry publication, and The Information — a tech industry publication, are sites born out of the SaaS era who are focused on doing a few things really well instead of trying to cover their entire world.
Those who will pivot to this new era will have to shed their advertising ambitions that required scale to achieve profitability and instead focus on their subscription ambitions that require focus, engagement and loyalty.
It’ll take smarter minds than mine to predict the era that will surface next, but no matter what it is, a recurring consumer revenue stream that forces a strong feedback loop with one’s customers, instead of advertisers, will prepare publications to listen, respond, and adapt, in near real-time to the shifting market.
It is an exciting time to be in journalism. Perhaps for the first time ever, it is our readers — not our advertisers — who are determining our fate. The implications of this change trickle down from the boardroom to the newsroom in profoundly positive ways. When you’re assigning stories not for clicks but for loyalty and retention, the journalism and the community will be better for it.

This post is part of our series covering the SaaS industry. You can find all our SaaS related stories on the P9 Capital Medium Channel. Many thanks to @chrija and @ncsh for their inputs and feedbacks.
In his “Three SaaS Sales Model” blog post, Joel York mapped the three main SaaS sales models the following way:
And as Joel explains:
“Choosing the right go-to-market sales model for your SaaS startup can be a make it or break it decision”
But equally difficult can be the task of expanding or moving from one quadrant to the other later on. It’s a challenge that many SaaS startups face at one point in their life, and one that can be particularly tricky.
Most of the time, the choice of the quadrant in which a company starts to operate is dictated by the DNA of its funding team.
The co-founders are ex-sales people who just quit their jobs from a big company? Chances are high that they’ll use the nice contact book they’ve built over the years to fuel their acquisition strategy and start at the enterprise level. The co-founders are designers or product people? I bet that they’ll start in the self-service zone. Come on, selling a product through salespeople is too cumbersome (and not scalable anyway :-)).
But there will probably be a time when the question of moving up or down the quadrants arises:
The challenges when moving from or expanding into another quadrant come from the fact that it’s not only about changing a pricing page, adding a couple of features and doing inbound marketing or hiring salespeople. It’s about taking into consideration all the components of your business and try to keep them aligned.
The obvious ones:
Product. The heart of your product might not change dramatically, but to appeal to bigger customers you’ll usually have to offer things like better user/permission management, admin features, more sophisticated analytics, reporting, data integration…
Pricing. This is an extremely well documented topic on the web. You’ll find plenty of articles explaining how to price your SaaS product for different targets and how to design your pricing page accordingly. Not easy to do (especially when your value proposition differs a bit from one target to the other) but you have a lot of interesting material available.
Marketing & Sales. Also well documented on the web, changing your quadrant means adopting a completely different sales and marketing playbook. From the way you speak to your customers to the content that you put out there and the communication channels you use. Refer to the awesome articles of Joel York, David Skok and Jason Lemkin.
Less obvious ones:
Company culture. The impact of such a change on your company culture shouldn’t be underestimated. The culture in a sales driven startup can be completely different from the culture in an inbound marketing driven or product driven company. Employees happiness and productivity will be challenged in the process and you’ll probably have to deal with many HR issues. It might even mean that a founder wants to leave, so a move like that obviously needs to be evaluated very carefully.
Learning velocity. Running a startup means learning and building knowledge along the way. The knowledge you build with time (industry knowledge but also operational knowledge) is a major asset in a startup and can give you a competitive edge. But since changing your sales model impacts many components of your business it can slow down your learning velocity tremendously. Your learning curve can be greatly impacted as you’ll have to forget some habits and build some new ones.
It’s very difficult to move from one quadrant to the other and getting it right can make or break your company. It shouldn’t be done solely from the pricing and sales process standpoints but also from the HR, learning and company culture ones.

Two years ago we produced the first version of our French Cloudscape mapping and analyzing more than 200 startups of the French ecosystem. We have since received many requests to update the map, and it’s what we finally decided to do for SaaStr Europa which was held in Paris in June 2018. You’ll find below the updated map with now more than 300 logos. I’m also sharing five important trends that, I believe, shaped the French ecosystem in the past two years.
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
If you are interested in more data points, I recommend the post of my colleague Louis Coppey:
medium.com
The first thing which struck me when I updated the map is how much the top twenty (by total amount raised) has changed:
In 2016 you needed to have raised a minimum of $14M to be part of the top twenty. This amount has almost tripled in 2018 to reach $37M. When you look at the startups in the top ten, you’ll notice that only three startups in 2016 are still there in 2018. A new generation of champions has emerged (Algolia, Front, Klaxoon, ContentSquare, Doctolib), and many promising companies have raised significant amounts the past two years: the median total amount raised by the startups on our map rose from $2.5M in 2016 to $7M in 2018.
I believe that this explosion is due to several factors:
Even if I work on the “dark side” of the force, fundraising is not the only way to finance a SaaS company. Self-financing, mainly through revenue generated by customers, is an increasingly popular path amongst French entrepreneurs.
I believe that this surge of bootstrapped startups is due to:
If there’s one aspect which is lagging behind it’s probably the exit one. The amounts raised might have exploded the past two years, but apart from Talend’s IPO, there were too few acquisitions and none was significant enough to really impact the ecosystem.
I believe that this is due to:
One of the interesting characteristics of the French market is the presence of many dynamic local SaaS ecosystems such as Nantes, Montpellier, Lyon, Lille or Toulouse. The past two years these local ecosystems kept growing: sprouting more and more interesting companies and attracting more capital. That being said Paris is still the most important one, and I don’t see the status-quo changing in the future:
When I updated the landscape, I was surprised to see so many requests coming from SaaS Enabled Marketplaces. If two years ago we had to explain the concept, it seems that many founders are now very comfortable with this model, and definitely consider themselves as part of this larger “SaaS ecosystem” (which is great).
I believe that we’ll continue to see more and more SaaS Enabled Marketplaces because:

Please Note: This article is referring to a former iteration of our paid offering.
At Kolide, we recently launched our Kolide Cloud product, which is a Software-as-a-Service application that aims to help macOS administrators leverage the power of osquery to understand the security and integrity of the devices which they’re responsible for managing.
Now that Kolide Cloud is public, I’m excited share some details on how we build and operate Kolide Cloud. In this article, I want to focus on our multi-tenant deployment model and how we use a Kubernetes Operator to deploy and manage many single-tenant instances of our application. Most Operators reason about the lifecycle of a single instance of a service or application, but at Kolide, we’ve written an Operator to manage hundreds of instances of an application which is itself composed of several component services.
Once we’ve discussed the Operator and how Kolide uses it to deploy and manage software, we’ll briefly discuss how it’s built and some things that we’ve learned programming against the Kubernetes API in Go.
Companies that create products for other companies or teams often have to reason about how to deal with the tenancy of each team. The two ends of the spectrum are:
When faced with these two options, most companies choose to build the multi-tenant monolith. While endeavoring to find Product-Market Fit, we rapid-prototyped a monolithic Rails application which used the Apartment Rails Gem to isolate customer-specific data in PostgreSQL schemas.
As we on-boarded more and more beta customers, however, we reasoned about the following two facts that are somewhat unique to Kolide:
Because of this, product developers were spending an unfortunate amount of time reasoning about scalability and data isolation when they should have been able to focus more fully on creating features that add value for customers. As a result, we decided to remove tenancy from the Rails application completely and start deploying and independently scaling single-tenant instances of the app on Kubernetes.
Kubernetes is a container-orchestration system that was created at Google as a open-source analog of their internal workload orchestration tool called Borg. If you buy-in to packaging and distributing software in containers, then tools like Kubernetes, Mesos, Docker Swarm, etc. are there to help you articulate how containerized workloads should be launched and managed, how these workloads communicate with each other, how deploys should work, etc.
The Operator pattern was introduced by CoreOS in 2016 to describe a way to embed operational knowledge into software. In the article, Brandon Phillips, the CTO of CoreOS, explains the pattern:
An Operator is an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user.
It’s not always clear what exactly it means for a piece of software to be a “Kubernetes Operator”, but I define it as the combination of a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and a Custom Controller which reacts to changes in instances of the CRD. In this article, I will refer to the Operator when I am describing the capability provided by the combination of the CRD and the Controller.
In Kubernetes, “resources” are defined via some declarative configuration. Usually these configurations are articulated via yaml:
In this example, the resource is a Deployment. If you “apply” this resource, Kubernetes will endeavor to run 3 replicas of the nginx:1.7.9 container. Custom Resources allow users to extend the domain language of Kubernetes to map more closely to their environment.
Tu Nguyen has written an excellent blog article on Kubernetes Controllers on the Bitnami blog. Further, the Kubernetes Documentation explains controllers in the following words:
In Kubernetes, a controller is a control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the API server and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state.
So if the set of Custom Resources is the “desired state”, then it is the responsibility of the Custom Controller to observe the actual state and endeavor to converge actual state and desired state by taking actions against the running system.
The astute reader may already be aware of the fact that there is a Kubernetes Working Group focused on Multi-Tenancy which is lead by David Oppenheimer (Google) and Jessie Frazelle (Microsoft). This working group deals with many different kinds of multi-tenancy and considers a wide variety of threat models. For a more complete overview of the work being done by this Working Group, I suggest David’s KubeCon Europe 2018 talk on Multi-Tenancy in Kubernetes.
At KubeCon Europe 2018, during the Multi-Tenancy WG Deep Dive, Christian Hüning gave a talk on a Tenant Operator that he is working on for his use-case of multi-tenant access to a Kubernetes cluster by potentially hostile users.
While related in several obvious way, the Operator that is described here is biased towards the deployment and on-going management of somewhat homogenous tenants that all come from the same distributor (Kolide Engineering). For our use-case, per-tenant data isolation is critical. Container and network isolation is important as well, but something we strive to improve over time. Resource metering is a non-issue for us because we don’t bill based on cluster utilization.
At Kolide, we have written an Operator which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of tenants in our Cloud product. This Operator intentionally embeds our domain and technology decisions into the software itself. The SRE team at Kolide endeavors to have the Operator manage as much of the daily operations of Kolide Cloud as possible.
The main interface for interacting with the system is the “Tenant” Custom Resource Definition. Consider the following example of a Tenant CRD:
Each Tenant resource maps to a single customer’s instance of the application. This approach allows us to boil down a tenant to just the attributes that change on an ongoing basis, such as:
Details like initial customer email and organization are included so that internal systems can reach out to customers during the account provisioning process.
Replicas are explicitly not managed via this CRD because we manage replicas via external systems that react based on observed resource utilization and customer size.
Whenever a Tenant resource is updated, the resource is queued for processing on a work queue in the controller. When a tenant is processed by the controller, the following general steps occur:
It’s important for each of these steps to be idempotent. It’s also critical for the happy path through these steps (ie: nothing changed since the last synchronization) to happen extremely quickly. A global cluster event (like a code deploy) may enqueue literally every tenant for processing. Our product is only just out of beta, but this is already several hundred tenants for us and growing every day as new customers sign up on our website.
Right now, we manage data infrastructure by interacting with GCP APIs directly. Each tenant resource enumerates it’s own database requirements and the controller takes care of creating the requisite databases and user accounts. The controller will then save the per-tenant credentials in our secret storage mechanism which is described in more detail in the next section.
For future versions of our operator, we are actively exploring provisioning infrastructure services in a more generic way by taking advantage of the Open Service Broker API. The OSB API defines a specification for provisioning and binding to infrastructure services. The ecosystem around the OSB API is extensive and the folks that are working on adding Service Catalog support to Kubernetes are doing excellent work.
In Kubernetes, workloads can only access secrets in their namespace. Because we run each customer’s workloads in their own namespace, we must copy shared secrets into each tenant namespace. Further, each tenant has several unique secrets for accessing isolated data infrastructure.
Being somewhat loyal Google Cloud customers at the moment, we use Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud Key Management Service to store secrets encrypted at rest. SREs and infrastructure services are granted access to encrypt and decrypt secrets in different environments as necessary using Google Cloud IAM. Since we use Kubernetes for literally everything at Kolide, we store serialized corev1.Secret blobs in GCS, encrypted at rest via KMS. It’s then easy for us to write tools which read secrets from GCS and unmarshal the secret into a Go objects. These tools are authenticated via GCP IAM rules and access can be easily audited and revoked as necessary.
The interface that we implement using the GCS and KMS APIs is as follows:
While our exo-cluster secret storage solution provides an effective mechanism for initializing clusters, neither GCS or KMS are low-latency enough to be in the hot path of the control loop. In order to support hundreds, if not thousands of tenants, the happy path of a tenant control loop needs to happen extremely quickly if no changes are required.
To do this, we first synchronize secrets from storage in a dedicated namespace within the cluster. This namespace is kept up-to-date. We then use well-established Kubernetes API primitives to maintain a local copy of all secrets in the cluster. When synchronizing a tenant, the control loop will use this cache to avoid unnecessary network interactions with any external secret storage mechanism whenever possible.
Optimizing the efficiency of the control loop has largely been an exercise in fast, accurate, secure secret management.
Each application component consists of a templated set of Kubernetes resources and a set of values to interpolate into the resources. Internally, we call our tools to apply values into resource template “varz”. Each component of a tenant is developed in it’s own repository and the Kubernetes configurations for that component are included in that repository.
The main reason why we include configurations with each repository is so that application configuration can be modified atomically in the same commit that modified application deployment requirements. For example, if a service adds a new required environment variable, the default value can be added to the environment-specific Kubernetes deployment configurations by the developer.
When we deploy tenant components, we specify the commit hash that we want to deploy. The control loop will then deploy a container built at that ref by applying configurations pulled from the repository at that commit. This makes it easy to atomically maintain configuration while enabling developers to own the configuration for their services.
We often get asked why we don’t use Helm for this use-case. While our resource templates are similar to Helm Charts, a few features of Helm make it unsuitable for our use-case. Notably, Helm requires a cluster service called Tiller which is an unauthenticated-by-default Cluster Admin service that installs software in a cluster. Since our controller is already a privileged service that can install software, the Tiller is a superfluous service which presents an unnecessary level of attack surface. Fortunately the design documents for Helm V3 describe a client-side model for installing Helm Charts and the Tiller is no longer a required component. Helm V3 sounds much more suitable for our use-case and we’re looking forward to trying it out once it’s available.
I’ve previously written on the Kolide Blog about using Go for scalable operating system analytics. When it comes to writing software in the Kubernetes ecosystem, Go is hands-down the best tool for the job.
I feel there can be a high barrier to entry in learning to use Kubernetes. Many of the concepts can feel foreign and it’s not always clear why every line of yaml needs to exist. Jason Moiron, a well-respected Go developer, recently wrote an interesting article which asked if Kubernetes is too complicated.
In my personal experience, while using Kubernetes felt tricky at first, once I got the core concepts down, I realized that everything works together in a really predictable way that actually accelerates your ability to learn about and integrate new concepts.
Similarly, when programming against Kubernetes APIs, it can feel foreign at first to an experienced Go developer. In my experience however, once you learn the structure of the Go API client as well as how Kubernetes ecosystem projects organize themselves, it becomes incredibly easy to program against mainline Kubernetes APIs as well as external/custom APIs in a consistent, intuitive fashion.
The Kubernetes Go API Client is maintained by the API Machinery Special Interest Group (SIG): https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go
The Go client has a really consistent look-and-feel for all types (Deployments, Pods, Namespaces, etc) in all API groups (core/v1, apps/v1, etc). For custom resources, there are code generation tools that allow users to generate API Clients from the struct definitions. Stefan Schimanski wrote a great introduction to Kubernetes API client code generation on the Red Hat Open Shift Blog.
Most Kubernetes ecosystem projects follow a somewhat consistent directory layout. From the root of the repository, a controller will usually have the following directories:
One project that does a great job following the patterns of a consistent Kubernetes ecosystem project is the Ark disaster recovery tool, written by some really helpful engineers at Heptio. Given that Joe Beda, the creator of Kubernetes, is the CTO of Heptio, it’s perhaps not surprising that their code sets a good example. We use Ark to backup and provision Kubernetes clusters, but that is a story for another blog.
Other operators that follow these consistent patterns nicely in my opinion are:
Dave Cheney has spoken about his opinion on how large a controller codebase should be and, at the time of writing, our controller is about 12,000 lines of Kolide-authored Go code. We’ve found that a codebase of this size is extremely manageable for us and we are not concerned about accommodating future growth effectively.
On my birthday this year, CoreOS released the Operator Framework, an open source toolkit designed to manage Operators in a more effective, automated, and scalable way. So far, the Operator Framework contains three components which help with:
For our use-case at Kolide, complicated lifecycle management and resource metering are not problems that we have, but one common problem that all controllers have to solve is the queueing and synchronized processing of resources as they change over time.
For most new controllers, I think that it probably makes sense to consider using the CoreOS library for this objective. If your use-case is sufficiently complicated or you just want more control, it may be worth using something like the official Sample Controller as an adaptable starting point instead.
Kubernetes has been described as a set of APIs for building distributed systems and as a “platform for building platforms”. We’ve enjoyed using Kubernetes to deploy, scale, and secure our product. We’re looking forward to continuing to discuss how we use Kubernetes to deliver Kolide Cloud here on the Kolide Blog.

Special thanks to @anirudh.vish (Anirudh Viswanathan) who has put all the efforts in compiling this list.
A couple of years back, young Tejaswi Raghurama had done an amazing job of collating 100 SaaS companies and had published it here. It had proved useful to so many and still remains a great resource. It is always a challenge for someone to point out Indian SaaS companies, and a comprehensive list like that helped.
But as time passed, I realised the list needed some updation and curation.
After being active in the SaaS eco-system for almost 6 years now and having also been contributing actively on the SaaSBooMi platform, I realised we have access to 350+ SaaS companies from India, and it would be great to collate all these companies and make it into a newer, leaner version.
Why am I doing this, you may ask. Is it a good way of spending my time? I think so. At this point in time, there is no single place where someone interested can go and find a list of SaaS companies, for whatever reason. The list can demonstrate the strength and vibrancy of the ecosystem that I have been a part of, and find a lot of pride in. The list can also help demarcate what each startup does, and their other specifics.
Though some of the data I’m talking about these companies may be available on Tracxn, that data is not free and not everyone can get access to it when they need it. And it makes no sense to be forced to pay a lot when you are looking for only one data point.
Here’s our snapshot of the India SaaS-ecosystem curated from SaaSBooMi attendees/applicants. Our tribute to the Founders, the Visionaries, and Makers of Tomorrow.

This is the story of how we spiced up our marketing campaign, brought a lot of smiles and drew attention in the recent SaaStr Annual event.
When doing your job right involves going unnoticed, how do people find out about your product? Managing subscriptions and recurring billing for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies places us in this category. This is the story of our latest efforts to get the word out about Chargebee.
“This is a revolution, there will be a Before Chargebee (B.C.) and an After Disruption (A.D.), in the industry!”
“O.K. but how do we get people’s attention?”
“We play on the B.C. and A.D. theme; this is year 0 for subscription management.”
“O.K. but HOW do we get people’s attention?”
“Let’s have people dressed as evangelists hand-out flyers.”
“Why not sexy nuns?”
“Hmm, na, company image? We’re a billing company, we must stay somewhat serious. “
“OK, regular nuns? Nuns handing out the 10 Commandments of SaaS?”
“Might work! But how do we go about it?”
SaaStr annual would be full of attendees from our target audience; it was approaching fast. We had just a couple weeks to write out the 10 Commandments of SaaS, get our design team to run its magic, print the mini tablets, and find the nuns!
On opening day, we were struck by divine luck, the SaaStr Annual was being held across the street from a Cathedral!! It was meant to be.
Our plan was to distribute the “10 Commandments of SaaS” as flyers. We included the hashtag #SaaS10 hoping this would become a little social media event. As it turned out, we were violating the event regulations by distributing marketing materials without sponsoring the event. We were gently warned by SaaStr folks to keep it out of the venue. In all fairness, they were right and we moved to the corner of the street to distribute.
But we then ran into another problem; the building’s agreement with the city forbids distribution of materials in front of the venue. We were, however, told that the sister could stand in the area in front of the conference entrance if we weren’t distributing anything. We had to regroup.
“Let’s print this tablet size?”
“You mean like the actual 10 Commandments?”
On the second day, the sisters were holding tablet sized commandments. And the result was surprising!
When the sisters had been trying to distribute flyers, people thought they were authentic nuns protesting the conference.
By having them hold big tablet sized SaaS Commandments, people realized this was just good fun, and started asking the nuns to take pictures with them. The social media fall-out was much stronger than the first day!
We brought a lot of smiles. More pictures, and even more Tweets.
Plus we landed a 90-second interview. :)
Prior to the event, we were a bit worried that doing something edgy to spread the word about us might affect our corporate image.
As it turns out, this had a hugely positive impact and we had a lot of fun doing it. Your smiles and pictures made us so happy! Thank You!
Here is a quick run-down of the operation:
And the 10 Commandments:
Feeling the buzz from this event’s success, we had 24 hours to complete another marketing tactic if we were to be in time for Valentine’s Day.
Earlier in the month, we had decided we wanted to occupy mind-space. We decided to send a Valentine’s Day card (yes, an actual paper card) to 200 start-up C.E.O.s, to grab their attention, and hopefully make them smile.
We created this:
We spent the better part of the afternoon stuffing envelopes, finding mailing addresses, licking stamps, and placing a heart sticker on the back so these wouldn’t be considered “junk mail”.
We managed to ship them all out in time…the only problem is that we have no way to trace the effectiveness of this method. No “open, click-through” stats for snail-mail.
Our next step is to reach out to the 200 people via an email about this blog post to see what the response is. Fingers crossed!
We’re happy to share our tactics but remember the 10th Commandment of SaaS: “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s growth hacks.” ;-)
If you think managing recurring revenue, subscriptions and invoicing is a pain in the SaaS, let us help you
Starting-up ? Check out our Launch Plan!

This article is a collaborative effort between Claire Suellentrop and Georgiana Laudi. Claire runs Love Your Customers and was previously Director of Marketing at Calendly. Gia runs A Better CX and was previously VP of Marketing at Unbounce.
“So, I keep seeing my clients go through this over and over.”“Um, yeah, dude. My clients are struggling with the same thing.”
When we first connected at the top of 2017, we’d just said farewell to our in-house roles at two wonderful SaaS companies.
And only a few months into consulting life, we’d already — independently of each other — spotted the same 2-sided problem:
Most of our clients — most of whom are high-growth SaaS companies — need the following from their head of marketing, all somehow rolled into one magical person:
It’s impossible to find a marketing leader who checks all four of these boxes. And unfortunately, finding someone who checks even three of them is incredibly rare.
If you can find marketers with lots of relevant SaaS experience, like those who’ve built a marketing team from the ground up, they’re taken, and expensive to lure. Not only that, but the SaaS space is still relatively small. When you inevitably start poaching (and you will), the news will travel.
Because experienced SaaS marketers are rare, those that do exist are busy — often to the point of being unavailable. If you can find one of the rare independent folks to help guide you or your team during those early days, get in line. Since we left our day jobs (two separate and unrelated events), let’s just say, neither of us have exactly had to knock on doors to find gigs — and neither have any of the other talented, independent marketers we know in the SaaS space.
So what’s a founder or CEO to do? The next best thing, which is to hire a more junior — though very hungry — marketer who’s less expensive, more available, and shows tons of potential.
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with making this choice; many well-known marketers come from nontraditional backgrounds, completely unrelated to SaaS, and thrive in the industry.
But without mentorship or a clear path to career growth, many of these marketers struggle and become frustrated — stuck in the weeds of execution, never quite able to focus on or master the strategy side of the role. This means the CEO must become the micromanager they don’t have time to be, since no dedicated mentor exists to nurture and grow this new marketer.
In a tech startup’s earliest stages, it’s common for founding teams to undervalue marketing.
This may be because of tunnel vision of building out the product, to lack of experience on the leadership team with demand gen, product positioning, and other key early-stage growth activities, or any number of other factors.
But in every case, this puts the marketer at a disadvantage: while their goal is to increase revenue — the lifeblood of the company — the projects they’re running are consistently deprioritized in favor of product development.
And yeah, this marketer is ambitious, excited to work in a “fast-paced environment” with a “culture of learning,” and passionate about the idea of building something from nothing… But the road to burnout is pretty short when you can’t get a second team member, or a more competitive salary (when you know you’re already one of the lowest paid people in the company).
Even those who don’t burn out and quit do struggle to see themselves as equals with other department heads — which can start a negative snowball of lost confidence, then over reliance on HiPPOs, and ultimately a marketing “strategy” that’s really just a list of tactics, prescribed out of context by stakeholders or influencers.
And because a list of tactics is not a solid strategy, growth stalls (or never starts). The founder, in serious need of more customers, has to spend more time, more money, on finding, hiring, and training a senior marketer after all.
And for the first marketer? That negative snowball of lost confidence just keeps growin’.
We know these details don’t match every tech company’s early days, but they do match many. We both know plenty of people, be they clients or colleagues, who are struggling on both sides of this problem right now.
So we decided to contribute to the training & mentorship early-stage marketers need by launching Forget the Funnel: a free, weekly series of 30-minute workshops that address the challenges faced by SaaS marketers.
Why the name ‘Forget The Funnel’? Because the traditional marketing funnel has no place in SaaS. Instead, marketing + product + customer success all go hand in hand to create one holistic customer experience.
It’s a serious mistake to think about marketing as something that stops when a new user signs up. This is central to both of our marketing philosophies, and how we built highly successful marketing strategies for 2 high-growth SaaS companies, each from the ground up. In other words, forget what you’ve learned about “the funnel”.
We love the world of SaaS, and genuinely want to help more companies succeed. At the same time, we want to help marketers own their strategy and become respected leaders. So during our workshops, attendees will learn things like:
If you’re facing some of these challenges yourself, we hope you’ll join us over at Forget The Funnel.
If you know someone who’s struggling to get out of the weeds, share Forget the Funnel with them. Here’s the details they’ll want to know.
For SaaS leaders to move beyond piecemeal marketing tactics…

“If only we had an option to create sub-tasks and use templates, we’d be x10 more productive. We could build more features. We could win!” — Everyone, all the time.
Sadly, it’s all lies.
In the recent years, there is a huge blossom in the Project Management area: “This tool is great for implementing Kanban!”, or “This tool has a great intuitive UX!” and “Yea, but this tool actually follows the Lean Startup principles” are thrown into the air faster than you deploy code to production these days.
I call bullshit.
I believe that focusing your time around Project Management tools is a premature optimization and probably #1 killer of many startups. Why? In a single word: “Focus”. In two: “Wrong Focus”.
In order to build a great company, here is what you need:
And here are some things you don’t really need:
Project Management tools may help you to manage your work more smoothly, but the question is not how fast are you able to deliver things but how fast are you able to learn that you’re delivering the wrong things and make the adjustments.
These adjustments will never be driven by using a better tool. It’s about your attitude, your culture, your DNA.
“But hey, I thought that it’s all about Execution!” It’s not. Well, it’s not the “Execution” you’re referring to anyway. This mantra is so popular today because we tend to read articles covering the top companies out there: Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Amazon etc. These companies already have a solid definition of purpose. They figured out how to scale their communication and hiring. These companies thrived because they were able to focus on customers, growth or revenues over time. Most chances, you’re not there yet.
This doesn’t mean Project Management tools are bad or evil. You may want to invest more in them, when your foundations and product are solid. Just don’t let “imperfect” Project Management tools to be an excuse for a failed business.
It’s like blaming a poor relationship with your spouse due to a lack of decent calendar app for your iPhone.

Follow me on Twitter for my thoughts on startups and venture capital.
I’ve written posts in the past aimed at helping founders benchmark their revenue growth and sales efficiency. This new post is focused on helping benchmark SaaS operating expenses (S&M, G&A, R&D) in more detail. Are your expenses in-line with other peers at your scale?
Historically, I would guide founders to benchmark their growth and expenses by using the “Rule of 40” which is a formula to analyze the health of a software business. Simply put, your growth rate and profit margin should add up to at least 40%. While this is a helpful rule of thumb, it is fairly high-level and doesn’t differentiate between costs allocated to different parts of the business. If you aren’t meeting the “Rule of 40” benchmark, how do you know where to better optimize? I recommend combining the “Rule of 40"" with the benchmarks I’ve created below.
A quick overview of the methodology:
If your company generated $100M in revenue, the median S&M spend for a company of this scale is 48% of revenue. Spend (as a % of revenue) is typically higher in the early stages of a company’s lifecycle as they are in the expansion phase and are actively building out their sales organization.
Given sales and marketing costs are a close driver of revenue growth, the % of S&M spend is less relevant in isolation. It’s important to also understand the efficiency of this spend. See my prior blog post on this topic (LINK). If your S&M spend is highly efficient in driving growth, it might make sense to increase investments in this area! If not, you need to re-evaluate your sales motion and/or product-market fit.
R&D refers to the activities companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services to the market. Some companies are in industries that are more competitive and must dedicate larger resources to product development in order to maintain market share and to drive growth. For example, when Slack generated $105M in revenue in 2016, it spent 59% of revenue on R&D which benchmarks much higher than other comps. In their public filings they note the following:
“To remain competitive, we must continue to develop new features, integrations, capabilities, and enhancements to Slack… Our failure to maintain adequate R&D resources or to compete effectively with the R&D programs of our competitors would give an advantage to such competitors and may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
To benchmark the efficiency of your R&D spend, follow the forward-year growth targets below. These are multiples of forward-year revenue growth rate divided by % revenue spend on R&D in the current year.
Returning to our example, when Slack generated $105M in revenue, the company spent 59% of sales on R&D which benchmarks well below the 25th percentile. However, Slack’s R&D expenses are somewhat justified given the growth. The company grew revenue 110% year-over-year in 2017, representing a 1.9x multiple (110% / 59%) which is near the 50th percentile of efficiency.
A few caveats: 1) The data here is noisier than for S&M efficiency, 2) these ratios do not control for spend in other areas which may also contribute to that growth, 3) the data doesn’t account neatly for investments that may take years to pay-off.
If anyone with a statistics background wants to volunteer some time to help me with a follow-up regression project, email me at parsa@ivp.com!
G&A expenses are incurred in the day-to-day operations of a business and may not be directly tied to a specific function or department within the company (e.g. operational overhead, rent, utilities, insurance, legal fees, etc.). G&A is often the target of cost-cutting when a company has cash-flow problems.
When evaluating G&A spend, make sure to ensure that the spend is associated with and directly impacts business results. Do these investments improve a company’s productivity and efficiency on a daily basis?
These figures should be used only as guidelines to help you benchmark if you’re in-line with your peers. Where you fall on the charts will depend a lot on your target customer base and whether you are a product-driven or sales-driven organization, as well as your company’s growth rate. Many companies can justify higher spend in S&M and R&D if they’re in hyper-growth mode. However, if your metrics fall above the 75th percentile or below the 25th percentile it’s still worth digging in to better understand if you’re over- or under-investing in these areas. Combining these benchmarks with the “Rule of 40” should give to a great lens into the health of your business on both the top- and bottom-line.

Top highlight
When we started Halp, we wanted to offer the best possible support experience for our customers. We also knew that all of our customers were using Slack, so it made a ton of sense to invite our customers into our Slack workspace.
What we didn’t know is how ridiculously low it would take our churn rate.
For our very early customers, we invited them as single channel guests in our Slack. This allowed us to get lots of feedback as we iterated on the product and quickly fix bugs as they came up. Our early customers such as Breather and TrendKite have become huge advocates of our company thanks to this, and our product is much better off too.
Then, Slack launched Shared Channels last September, making it even easier to open up channels between Slack workspaces. We started opening up private channels for our VIP customers. These customers have an incredibly strong relationship with us — they are much more likely to report any issues that come up and any feature requests they have.
As a result, not a single one of our customers we share a Slack channel with has churned!
For a growing SaaS company, keeping customers around for the long term is crucial to success. A customer segment that isn’t churning is money in the bank. It’s not just us who’ve seen incredible benefits from supporting our customers over Slack. Here’s why I think more companies should embrace customers in their Slack workspaces, along with a few ideas on how to get started.
As of May 2018, Slack has 8 million daily active users. Chances are — your customers already live in Slack.
Most companies rely on email or chat for support — but it turns out that’s a surprisingly high friction method of support for business customers today. Customers are used to messaging colleagues, friends, and family in Slack or Messenger. Moving to email seems surprisingly impersonal. Forcing customers through a formal contact form or into a long email thread creates a barrier between you, and makes it difficult to respond quickly to high priority issues.
That barrier prevents companies from hearing the full story of their customer’s experience.
It’s estimated that only 1 out of every 26 customers who run into a problem will contact your company.
Those other 96% of customers are silently unhappy. Drawing these silent unhappy customers into communicating with your team gives you another chance to fix the problem.
Inviting customers into Slack reduces the barrier between company and customer and returns better feedback. That insight is invaluable for creating a better product, building better relationships, and saving potentially unhappy customers. It’s also a life saver for staying on top of urgent issues for your most valuable customers.
If you’re ready to open the door and invite customers to get a little closer, you’ll need to decide how to organize your Slack. While Slack User Communities are becoming more and more popular, businesses also have the option to open private customer communication channels. Here’s three ways to set up your Slack workspace for working with customers:
Slack allows teams to invite guests into just one or two channels in their workspace. This can be really helpful if you have a customer advisory board, or a customer feedback channel. The product team can ask customers how they use a specific feature, or work with beta users on a new release.
There’s a ton of benefits to inviting customers into a Slack channel:
The only potential downside is that the customer must create a new, separate account on your company’s Slack… which can create a little separation between them and your company.
Shared channels are a relatively new feature of Slack. They allow stakeholders from multiple companies to collaborate in one channel, in the comfort of their own Slack workspace.
It’s a great tool for technical onboarding and VIP customers. Instead of scheduling check-in sessions, or responding to long email chains, onboarding specialists can keep a real-time pulse check on implementation.
Toru Takahashi, Support Engineering Manager at Treasure Data, created shared channels for each new customer in their Slack workspace, ands says
“Using Slack for the onboarding process makes it much easier to communicate with customers in real-time, compared to email. This helps us to power an awesome onboarding experience for our new customers and existing customers.”
Ongoing support in Slack helps VIP customers feel more like teammates than users. Cobi Druxerman, founder of Taplytics, found that sharing a Slack channel has helped them build much stronger relationships with their customers.
“Our hypothesis was that the people you’ve developed a relationship with and who have a real-time channel for communication don’t think twice about reaching out with the smallest of issues.”
Finally, companies can create public user groups on Slack. Every new customer gets invited to join a Slack workspace that includes employees and customers discussing the product.
Slack communities take advantage of a many-to-many support model. Power users can dive in and help new users get the most out of the product. Newer users feel like they are part of something bigger. This helps reduce support costs, while increasing customer loyalty. We wrote a step by step guide to setting up a Slack community here.
ProdPad, like us, have never had a customer churn who is a part of their Slack community. They attribute this to the sense of engagement, transparency and ownership community members feel from contributing to the discussion. Andrea Saez, Head of Customer Success, found, “even lurkers in our community are still finding value in passive engagement.”
Being constantly available to customers can sound like a customer support manager’s worst nightmare. But there are ways to support customers in Slack on your own terms — and without causing chaos in your inbox.
You don’t want a free-for-all, because you’ll let things drop through the cracks. Cobi at Taplytics found that real-time support requires a greater dedication to process than asynchronous support channels.
“We use a combination of Slack, Zendesk, and Pivotal Tracker to ensure that all of the right people know what issues are outstanding, what the priorities are, who is responsible for what, and which customers require attention.”
Treasure Data also had to make adjustments to their workflow when setting up Slack support:
Right now a combination of Slack and help desk software is the best way to stay on top of the increased channels, Halp offers an integration that helps with this. But this space is evolving very quickly. I’m expecting to see a lot more competition for Halp over the next few months as more and more companies catch on to just how powerful it is to invite customers closer…you just can’t beat 0% churn 😍
Eventually, one of our customers in our Slack workspace will churn, and we’ll have to deactivate their channel. It will be a sad day, and we aren’t in a rush to see our perfect record ruined.
But embracing customer relationships over Slack has reduced the number of times we’ve had to say goodbye to a customer. We know that we’re building a product that our customers want, because we talk to them, openly and earnestly, every day in our Slack.
Is it time to start inviting customers to get a little closer to your company?

Há algumas semanas fiz um post chamado “Uma breve análise sobre as empresas de Software da Bolsa Brasileira”, sobre as características das empresas SaaS negociadas na B3 (Bolsa Brasileira). Desde então venho querendo falar sobre a atuação de M&A por essas empresas como forma de acelerar o crescimento, criar novas ofertas e entradas em novos mercados, assim como geração de valor para acionista.
Nesse sentido, este texto busca explicar:
Como o último artigo, esse cobrirá especificamente as empresas de Software do Brasil com ações negociadas na B3, que tem seus dados divulgados na internet. São elas: TOTVS (B3: TOTS3) , Linx (B3: LINX3), Locaweb (B3: LWSA3)e Sinqia (B3: SQIA3).
Disclaimer: As análises e opiniões são minhas e eu não quero, nem posso, fazer indicação de investimento. Espero apenas que esse post possa trazer alguns insights para suas análises e para sua vida empreendedora ou investidora.
O M&A para essas empresas não é transformacional, é apenas uma tática usada pelos formuladores de estratégias para atingir os objetivos de inovação e de capacitação da empresa de forma mais rápida ou melhor.
Cada uma das quatro empresas de Software da B3 tem as suas diretrizes de M&A, com suas prioridades e foco em mercados diferentes mas que, em linhas gerais, podemos dizer que giram em torno dos seguintes objetivos:
1 — Aprofundar / Reforçar / Defender o negócio principal — Exemplo: compra de base/carteira de clientes ou de rede de distribuição.
2 — Ampliação de receita através de upselling ou cross-selling — Exemplo: Aquisição de solução para oferta casada com outros produtos, incrementando a proposta de valor.
3 — Expandir para novos mercados — Exemplo: Abertura de novos mercados através da aquisição de empresa, ou solução tecnologia, que já tem atuação em mercado ainda não operado pela empresa compradora.
Para exemplificar, veja abaixo alguns slides da apresentações institucionais dessas empresas que mostram um pouco dessas ideias:
O slide da TOTVS mostra claramente os pilares estratégicos de M&A e as áreas de focos das soluções pretendidas para M&A:
A Linx mostra bem as áreas estratégias de negócios, eonde a adição de novas soluções por M&A podem agregar:
A Locaweb deixa claro no seu prospecto e exemplifica as áreas de sinergia que busca, que está atrelado a principais iniciativas de negócios como, por exemplo, a linha de meios de pagamento, através do Yapay:
A Sinqia também deixa claro a busca que tragam em Clientes, Produtos e Tecnologias complementares:
Aquisição da Hiper veio para posicionar a Linx como uma solução também para base da pirâmide, ou seja, nos pequenos varejistas. Além disso, a Hiper implementou da nova solução de pagamento da Linx, LinxPay, dentro dessa base.
Por meio da aquisição da Supplier, a Totvs consegue prover serviços financeiros e lançar o produto TOTVS Antecipa:
Como a empresa descreve no prospecto de IPO, a Tray, plataforma de ecommerce, trouxe o maior upsell para Locaweb através da contratação de plano básico para loja virtual de clientes Locaweb que buscavam ter a presença online e domínio. A Locaweb conseguiu multiplicar o valor da empresa desde a aquisição.
De acordo com a tabela abaixo, a mediana dos múltiplos de Valuation que a TOTVS, Linx e Sinqia têm adquirido EMPPESAS foi de 2,4x a receita anual deSSas empresas. (Esse valuation contempla o valor de earn-outs contingenciados que poderão, ou não, ser atingidos e efetivados.)
O fato desses mercados para soluções de software serem fragmentados, ou seja, existem diversas soluções disponíveis para diferentes problemas e, ainda, com baixa competição por operações de M&A, as Empresas Compradoras se encontram em uma posição favorável na negociação da aquisição, podendo negociar a múltiplos menores.
No meu post anterior sobre SaaS, eu também comentei alguns pontos que fazem as empresas SaaS da B3 terem múltiplos de valuation altos, como, por exemplo, o do Valor da Empresa representando até 9x o faturamento, conforme o quadro abaixo. Em linhas gerais, isso tem a ver com fatores como métricas (de crescimento, retenção de clientes e rentabilidade), assim como o tamanho da receita e as taxas de retorno (TIR) atrativa para investidores de bolsa, mesmo elas sendo negociadas a múltiplos maiores.
Porém, outros fatores, os quais as empresas privadas e de médio porte não conseguem se beneficiar, e que elevam os múltiplos nas empresas de Bolsa, são também: (1) Liquidez — o fato da empresa ter ações líquidas no mercado (no caso das empresas privadas, a falta de liquidez), e (2) o Tamanho de Mercado Endereçável maior — em que as empresas maiores, geralmente, têm uma oferta maior e mais madura de soluções que aumenta o seu mercado total endereçável (TAM) e, portanto, seu potencial.
Esse descasamento dos múltiplos de empresas adquiridas — por volta de 2x o faturamento para precificação de M&A — versus as empresas negociadas em bolsa, com múltiplos de até 9x o faturamento, faz com que haja uma geração explicita e instantânea de valor a partir da execução da estratégia de M&A das empresas negociadas em Bolsa.
Acima um exemplo, assumindo dados fictícios, visa explicar como as empresas adicionam valor mercado a partir das transações de M&A. Onde a Empresa Adquirida estáprecificada a 2x a receita e a Empresa Compradora está precificada a 7x a receita.
Basicamente, explicando o exemplo:
Assim que ocorre a aquisição de uma Empresa de Médio Porte pela Empresa Compradora —pelo valor de 2x a sua receita da Empresa Adquirida , pagos através do caixa da Empresa Compradora.
A receita da Empresa Adquirida será incorporada ao resultado consolidado da Empresa Compradora — que está precificada em bolsa em 7x a receita.
Com isso, é esperado um acréscimo de Valor de Mercado à Empresa Compradora no montante da diferença dos múltiplos multiplicado pela receita da Empresa Adquirida, ou seja, neste caso 5x a receita dela.
Meu exemplo é apenas um racional e a prática de alguns investidores e analistas para projeção e valuation, mas, como todas premissas pode ser discutível. Cada investidor tem diferentes perspectivas, análises, crenças e objetivos sobre operações de M&A pela suas empresas investidas. Além disso, muito investidores já costumam antecipar essas premissas e, muitas vezes, já precificam o valor do caixa líquido das empresas para M&A e adicionando a diferença entre os múltiplos das aquisições e de mercado de bolsa.
É importante ter em mente que no fim das contas, a análise fundamentalista como fizemos aqui, mira o retorno no longo prazo. Portanto, as empresas que estão adquirindo outras empresas deverão manter ou melhorar sua performance de rentabilidade e crescimento para, principalmente, continuar a gerar valor para justificar seu múltiplos altos e continuar adicionando valor mercado.

Top highlight
Kubernetes is a platform to manage and orchestrate your cloud infrastructure. It provides a configuration-driven framework where you can define a few different pieces and with one click get an entire network, disk, and application spun up in a way that’s scalable and easy to manage.
Moving your application over to Kubernetes is a high-effort activity if you haven’t designed your app with containers in mind from the start. The goal of this article is to help you on your path towards containerizing your applications with Kubernetes integration in mind.
Be aware that if you try and force your application into Kubernetes without the proper architecture, you will be essentially shooting yourself in the foot by wasting time and accruing technical debt.
A container is basically a partitioned section of the operating system that can function as an independent machine. Unlike traditional virtual machines, which rely on a hypervisor to simulate an operating system, containers use a variety of kernel features to provide an environment isolated from the host machine.
Containerization is a fairly simple process — using Docker, just define a Dockerfile which lays out the steps needed to install your application on an OS (download packages, install dependencies, and so on).
Then, build an image which can be used by developers. More information about the containerization process can be found on Docker’s website.
Before you move to Kubernetes, you need to take a hard look at the current way you deliver your application to the end-user.
Traditional web applications use a multi-tenant architecture. This means all your users will be sharing a single database instance and a single instance of an application. This can be made to work in Kubernetes — however, I urge you to consider implementing a multi-instance architecture to fully utilize the power of Kubernetes and containerized applications.
Some major benefits of adopting a multi-instance architecture are:
In order to have the most cost-effective infrastructure, you need to pin down how much CPU, memory, and storage are going to be required to run a single instance of your application.
This way, you can set limits so you can get an accurate reading of how much space your Kubernetes nodes need, as well as making sure your nodes aren’t going to become overloaded and unreliable.
This is usually a trial-and-error process, but you can use a monitoring solution such as Heapster to give a straightforward breakdown of the resources your pods are consuming. This will let you gauge how much to allocate.
After you figure out your resource allocation, you can calculate optimal server sizes for your Kubernetes nodes so you get the most bang for your buck.
You take the memory or CPU each instance needs to function, and multiply it by 100 (the maximum number of pods a node can hold). This will give you a ballpark estimate of how much memory/CPU your nodes should have.
Still, you should always stress test your application to ensure it runs smoothly when the node fills up.
Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, there are a lot of DevOps practices you can begin developing to make your life easier. Some of these integration points take the following forms:
When your nodes become full, generally you want to provision more nodes so everything can keep chugging along smoothly. One way you can do this is with a tool like kops.
Some applications will need to be scaled up or down based on the current usage. Kubernetes provides this function out of the box using triggers which automatically scale deployments. For example, running this command:
will set the myapp deployment to scale up to 10 pods when the CPU percentage goes above 50.
For a multi-instance architecture, end-users will ultimately be requesting applications be deployed in Kubernetes. To provide this, you should be looking at integrating your app with the Kubernetes API, or using a third-party solution such as ServiceBot to provide a portal to request instances.
A growing trend lately has been end-users attaching their domain to applications. Kubernetes has tools in place to make this process easier and even get to the point where it becomes self-service (users pressing a button to get their domain pointing to the pod). You can use a system such as Nginx Ingress to accomplish this.
Kubernetes is a great way to manage your cloud infrastructure. If you are in a position where you are having trouble scaling your application, consider moving to a Kubernetes-based architecture. You will see a large increase in your DevOps productivity when it comes to deployments, clustering, and overall stability.
ServiceBot is a platform that helps you manage your SaaS by automating billing, deployments, and your sales pipeline.

2018年もそろそろ終わり。来年は年号も変わるのも大きいが、2019年は日本経済にとっても大きなニュースが「景気回復期間が戦後最長」となる74ヵ月になることだ。（アメリカは更に長く2019年7月には過去最高の120ヵ月を更新する。）日本は、肌感の無い低温経済や直近の株安等から、「冬がそろそろ…」という話はしばしば議論される。
私は経済学者でもないので、「次の不況/リセッションがいつ来るのか？」を予測できないが、来る冬に備えて、前回のリセッションである2008年の金融危機(リーマンショック)から学びを得ることはできるはずだ。そこで今回は、2008年前後のアメリカのSaaS上場企業の状況を見つつ、SaaSの不況への耐性や次のリセッションに向けての考察を書きたい。
SaaS Capitalのデータによると、2008年リーマンショック時に上場していたSaaS企業数は、Salesforce.comやConcurなどを含め17社ある。2018年にSaaSの上場企業数は約80社あることを考えると、当時はSaaSがまだ新しかったことも伺える。
まずは、ざっくりSaaS17社のIPOタイミングと存続状況を見てみる。
結論から言うと、「当時のSaaS上場企業は経営破綻することなく、前回の不況を乗り切っている」ことがわかる。
この要因の1つとして、リーマンショック直前に、IPOによる大型の資金調達を行ったため、不況を乗り越えられるだけの潤沢な資金があったことがあると想定される。直前3年間で17社中11社、特に内6社が2007年IPO。
ただ、Omnitureについては、Adobeに2009年にM&Aされているが、不況で危機的な経営状況だったというより、不況を乗り越えられるだけの体力はありつつ、戦略的な意図で前向きなM&Aだったと考える。何故ならば、①$1.8Bn.の大型M&Aだった、②2006年半ばにIPOしており十分な資金はあったはずだからだ。
ただIPOによる大型の資金調達だけが、当時の上場SaaS企業が全て生き残れた要因とは考えにくい。何故ならば、SaaS企業の場合、上場後も赤字企業が多いからだ。故に、SaaSビジネスの特性に起因する部分も少なからずあると考えられる。
ここをより詳細に見るために、Omnitureを除く16社について財務状況(売上、利益）を中心に詳細に分析を進める。
まずは、16社の4半期ベース売上の推移を見てみる。
ざっと見てみると、多くのSaaS企業が不況にも関わらず、継続して売上成長をしていたことが判る。目に見えて売上減少があるのは、DealTrackとKanexaくらい。Salesforceに至っては、他SaaS企業の2倍超の規模だが成長し続けている。
次に、より詳細かつ定量的に見るために、16社の売上成長率と営業利益率の推移(中央値)で見てみる。なお、売上成長率については、4半期ベース売上をベースに年間成長率に換算した。
まず売上成長率について。不況以前に+44%から最低レベルで+7%まで成長は鈍化しつつも、SaaS全体としてはプラス成長を維持できていた。USのGDP全体が2008、2009年連続でマイナス成長だったことを踏まえると、SaaSの不況への耐性の強さが伺える。
一方、営業利益率を見てみると、不況期間に数%の利益率下落がありつつも、売上成長率の下落に比較して、影響はごくわずかで、SaaSが収益面でも耐性が強いように思う。この点は、SaaSの「長期契約×リカリング性」、「チャーン・コントロールの良さ」、そして「営業/マーケのデータに基づくコスト・コントロールの良さ」が起因していると考えられる。
更に深く、リーマンショックの間のSaaS企業の状況を理解するために、16社別に売上成長率と営業利益率を見てみたい。
直感的にわかり易くするために、今回は分析フレームとして、いわゆる「40%ルール」をベースに以下の3つゾーンに分けてみてみたい。
ゾーン①スター：営利率+成長率≧40%(SaaSの超優良企業）
ゾーン②優等生：0%≦営利率+成長率<40%(優良と言えるレベル)
ゾーン③問題児：営利率+成長率<0%(経営的に問題のあるレベル)
これをベースに、当時のSaaS16社のリーマンショック期間(‘08/2Q-’09/2Q)の平均実績をプロットすると以下の通り。
結果は驚くべきことに、全体の70%超(16社中13社)のSaaS企業が不況にも関わらず、優良以上のレベルの実績を維持している。中でも、Concur、Salesforce.com、Athena Health、Constant Contactの4社は、平時でも達成が難しい①スターのレベルを維持していた。
一方、残り30%弱(16社中3社)は③問題児のレベルにあり、SaaSは不況に対して柔軟に対応する能力は高いが、完璧ではないことも伺える。
（上記の詳細なデータは以下の通り)
ちなみに参考までに、現在も上場を継続している5社の株価推移を見ていると、ほぼ前述の分析結果と同様で①スター企業と②優等生の上位企業は、NASDAQ 100と比較して、マーケットより高く評価されている傾向が見える。一方、当然だが③問題児企業は低い。
今回は、前回の不況前後のSaaS企業の状況から、SaaSが不況に強いのか？を見てみた。全体的に見れば、SaaSモデルは不況への耐性/柔軟性が高いと言える。経営破綻に追い込まれた企業は無いし、80%以上の企業が不況時でも売上成長を実現している。その上、70%以上の企業が経営状態も不況時でも安定させている。ただ少なからず例外はあるので、「SaaSだから不況も心配ない」と考えるのは禁物だ。
そこで最後に、私が考える「不況に備えてSaaS企業が考えるべき、4つのこと」を説明したい。
先の不況の際はSaaS上場企業の60%は、直前3年間にIPOしており、サバイブするだけの資金が潤沢にあったことが要因であったように、SaaS企業にとって、不況前に大きく資金調達できるかは重要なカギ。
不況が来てから、ファイナンスやってはダメ。その理由は、以下のSaaS企業の売上マルチプルの推移から見て欲しい。今では10x前後と言われるSaaSのマルチプルは、リーマンショック時は2x前後まで下がっている。
SaaSはマルチプルが見えやすい分、下がったタイミングで行うと、大きく資金調達するのが難しい。そのためにSaaSスタートアップにとっては、不況前にファイナンスの強いメンバーの採用や、(ファンドサイズの大きい)頼れるVCを味方につけることは、強力な武器になる。また経営陣は、VC/証券会社など、比較的マーケット感がある外部の協力者を持って、マーケットへの感覚は研ぎ澄ましておいた方が良い。
SaaSがPL上赤字でも不況を乗り越えられたもう1つの理由は、年間契約などの長期契約により、前払い一括でキャッシュ・インが早く、BS上キャッシュが潤沢だったことも大きいと考える。そのためには、SMBよりエンタープライズの方がベターなのは言うまでもない。(但し、資金調達力が高ければSMBでの成長を志向することも十分可能。）
また、価格設定や契約期間の見直しも早めにすべきだ。SaaSスタートアップの場合、価格設定もSMBにフィットさせて低単価に陥ったり、1–6か月の様な短期のケースも多い。故に、キャッシュフローが安定させにくい。そのため、価格設定もエンタープライズ向けに再考したり、契約期間も1–2年などの長期契約をベースに変えた方がベター。
チャーン(解約)は平常時でもSaaSの敵だが、不況時はSaaSの死神へと変わる。当たり前だが、チャーンが高いプロダクトは、顧客の必然性が低い、ないしは顧客の粘着性(スティッキネス)が低い。そのため、企業の業績が悪化すると速攻で切られる。
またその2同様で、チャーン・コントロールの観点でも、エンタープライズ・シフトはやるべき。SMBは通常時でもチャーン・レートが高い上に、不況に対しての企業の耐性も弱く、経営破綻のリスクが高い。
SaaS企業は不況の間、売上成長率が鈍化しても、営業利益率は比較的安定していたことが前述の通りだ。そのためには、営業/マーケティングのデータの見える化、筋肉質な組織化は必要不可欠だ。規模が小さい内はエクセルでも良いが、そのために様々なSaaSプロダクトが市場にあるので、ぜひ活用してみるのも一考だと思う。
あくまで一投資家の意見だが、参考になれば幸いです。

Bootstrapping in SaaS it isn’t that hard, per se. It happens all the time.
Companies like Atlassian and Qualtrics have cruised past nine-figures in ARR (and IPO’d in the case of Atlassian) without needing any venture capital.
Take a look at our great deep-dive discussion with Ryan Smith, CEO of Qualtrics here:
There are generally a handful of common characteristics though that make Bootstrapping to Scale work in SaaS:
Again, the #1 more important thing to understand in SaaS is you can totally do it without external funding. It will be HARD. But so is everything. But you need to budget an extra 2 years to get to Initial Traction ($1.5m or so in ARR), and then, an extra 2 years to get to Initial Scale ($10m in ARR or so). Both stages will likely take longer. Because you’ll grow more slowly. It will take longer until you can afford the first few sales reps. Longer to afford your first VP of Sales. Longer until you have enough money to hire a VP of Marketing and afford a few marketing experiments. Longer until you can hire enough engineers to close key feature gaps.
And also — the choice isn’t always so binary. Many successful SaaS start-ups bootstrap to $1m in ARR or so, and then raise their first external capital to grow faster. That still adds time to the journey. But it lets you skip the dilution associated with a seed round. Not the worst strategy in the world.

I launched 4 SaaS projects in 2020.
3 of them failed.
My 4th, ContactEcom was a complete hit. A fairly simple idea: High quality leads for e-commerce stores.
After many lessons along the way, I found the magic formula for success
This is the golden niche no one talks about.
Your SaaS should help people make more money.
There are shitty courses online that help people get into dropshipping or e-commerce. These courses make millions.
Why are they so successful?
They help people make more money
If you help people make more money, your churn will be lower.
You can also charge more.
I used a SaaS Boilerplate template called ‘SaaSPegasus’ to save hundreds of hours. It allowed me to focus on what really mattered, wasting time on the the logic for password resets.
Along with poor social skills, tech dorks have no business sense.
No one I worked with in Silicon Valley would have thought ContactEcom was a good idea.
wHy WouLD SoMEonE pAy $145 fOr 500 EmAiLS???
— Some dork that pays $3.99 for feet pics on OnlyFans.
If they go on Reddit or Hacker News you should disregard their opinions entirely. Just because you can make something doesn’t mean you can sell it.
Making online is a simple equation:
Offer/Value + Traffic = $$$
It doesn’t matter if you have a cool idea if no one knows about it. This is the one thing people forget.
‘Build it and they will come’ — A Liar
The technical part of making a SaaS is the easiest part. The hard part is traffic and growth hacking.
Even with 8 years in Silicon Valley, I’ve never heard this talked about once, even though it’s the secret to Silicon Valley’s success.
30% of all VC investments goes to Facebook Ads, Google Ads and AWS
The best books I read in 2020 that helped me along the way are:
Traffic Secrets — Russel Brunson
Hacking Growth — Sean Ellis
1M Followers: Get A Massive Social Following in 30 Days — Brendan Kane
Whether it’s organic traffic from your social media following, SEO, FB Ads, etc. You NEED traffic to water your money tree.
If you’re technical, find a marketer
If you’re a marketer, find a technical partner
Split the equity. You’ll get much farther together than alone.
Don’t wear all hats.
SaaS addiction is real.
Digital Real Estate gives you equity and cashflow.
It’s also scalable. Everyone I know, including myself doubled and even tripled their income in 2020. While the rest of the world is in a pandemic, we’re in a bandemic.
While we’re still under lockdown, I’ve decided to start a SaaS empire. As of this writing I have 4 active projects in my pipeline and a dev team.
In the meantime I have friends building a traffic empire on Youtube, IG, FB and TikTok.
SaaS is an extremely untapped market because most people in Silicon Valley are busy over-engineering things people don’t care about.
A few years ago I realized my skills were too one-sided. I was too technical, I had one missing piece. So I spent the last 2 years in internet marketing and entrepreneurship communities.
I’d like to thank my tech sales friends, and Money Twitter for showing me how sales and internet marketing is done. I wouldn’t be where I am today without you.

Top highlight
Back in 2014, I wrote a post titled “Five ways to build a $100 million business”. If you haven’t seen it yet, the central idea of the article was to look at how many customers you need, for a given ARPA, to get to $100 million in annual revenue and what this might mean for your sales and marketing strategy. That post went kind of viral, which led us to create a follow-up piece, an infographic, a poster (which you can see on the left and order here), and a PlayPlay video.
What did I learn from that experience? First, if you want to write a killer blog post, it helps if you take a difficult question and simplify it drastically, give it a catchy headline, and add pictures of cute animals. ;-) More importantly, though, using my five little animals as a simple framework has helped me challenge (and hopefully occasionally provide sound advice on) the scaling strategies of numerous startups over the last couple of years.
Here’s what’s changed.
In my original post, I spoke about five ways to build a $100 million Internet company. The post wasn’t specifically about B2B SaaS companies, which is why two of the five ways dealt with customers with an ARPA of $10 and $100, respectively. I will keep the $100 ARPA customers (AKA mice) for now, but today it’s time to say goodbye to the $10 ARPA flies. Bye-bye, dear fly, you’ll always have a special place in my heart. Thank you for adorning so many slides and posters — maybe someone will resurrect you for a consumer-focused version of this framework.
Five years ago, I thought it would make sense to use a $100,000 ARPA elephant as the largest animal on the chart. The main reason is that I grew up as a consumer software and consumer Internet founder, and even though I had already spent about five years as a SaaS investor when I wrote the post, my experience was heavily skewed towards SMB SaaS. I did include two larger animals in a followup post, but meanwhile, I think that the $1,000,000 ARPA whale deserves a place as one of the five prime SaaS animals. While there are only a few SaaS companies with an ARPA of around $500,000 (not quite a whale yet, but definitely much larger than an elephant) across the entire customer base (Veeva, Workday, Demandware, Opower,…), there are quite a few SaaS companies with a significant whale customer segment. Most public SaaS companies, unfortunately, don’t report any data broken down by different customer segments, but it’s pretty safe to assume that Salesforce, Box, Zuora, and a number of other companies derive a significant portion of their revenue from whale customers.
This is a smaller, somewhat technical change. The original chart showed the number of customers on the x-axis and the ARPA on the y-axis. Since it’s more customary to use the x-axis for the dependent variable (and as I think it makes more sense to think of ARPA as the dependent variable), I have switched the axes. I had made that change in the poster already and have now updated the chart here as well.
One thing I’ve learned over time is that just because there are five ways to build a $100 million business, it doesn’t mean that those five ways aren’t equally promising. To quote the pigs in George Orwell’s “Animal Farm” (one of the very few books that we had to read at school that I liked): All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
Let’s take a step back. The key take-away of my “5 animals framework” is very simple: if you want to get to $100 million in annual revenue you’ll have to find customer acquisition channels that are highly scalable and profitable. Otherwise, you’ll never get to the number of customers that you need at your given ARPA. The problem is that most customer acquisition channels are either scalable or profitable but not both at the same time (which is why early CAC/LTV metrics can be so misleading, more about that here). Now, it seems like in some ARPA regions it’s easier to scale profitably than in others. This is certainly what we’ve seen in our portfolio: Several of our SaaS portfolio companies successfully went upmarket — oftentimes from rabbits to deer or even elephants — when they saw that they would hit a growth ceiling in their existing segment. One of the underlying reasons is that in order to get very large, you have to get your churn rate close to zero (or better yet, achieve negative churn), which is usually not possible if you’re selling only to SMBs; the other reason is that outbound sales doesn’t work if your ARPA isn’t large enough, which sort of limits your addressable market to companies that are more or less pro-actively looking for a solution like yours.
If you take a look at this analysis by Sammy Abdullah of Blossom Street Ventures (a VC with the tagline “We’re the anti-VC”, by the way) you’ll see that although Sammy points out that most SaaS companies don’t have an ACV of $50k or more, the vast majority of the 61 publicly traded SaaS companies from his list are deer or elephant hunters. Only 15 of the companies from the list had an ACV of less than $5k at the time of their IPO, and for some of them, the average is misleading because a large part of their revenue comes from customers with a much higher ACV (e.g. Zendesk, Box).
A recent analysis of private SaaS companies by Nathan Latka suggested the same. In his analysis, Nathan looked at 369 companies at around $1M in ARR. 186 of those (50%) are focused on rabbits or smaller animals (he really used those animal analogies). Of the 20 companies with $100M in ARR that Nathan looked at, on the other hand, only 6 (30%) are focused on low ACVs. If you are a successful rabbit-hunting SaaS company and you think you can keep growing in your current segment, these numbers shouldn’t discourage you, though. First, especially the numbers from private companies need to be taken with a grain of salt. And second, even if there is a statistically significant clustering of mid-market and enterprise SaaS companies at the $100M ARR mark, the data also shows that it’s possible to get there with a low ARPA!
Update:March 13, 2020Here’s a webinar that I did about the topic a few days ago:

Growing your startup carries a similar principle to growing your net worth. The first million is the hardest.
What about your first 1,000?
For founders without a marketing background, it can be a massive struggle to get to that first 1,000 user milestone. After giving advice to over 100 bootstrapped founders on Reddit over the last 6 months, I decided to compile the big eight, common elements I found that really pushed the needle for those founders.
Betalist, ProductHunt, HackerNews and many others are available for you to freely post your SaaS product and promote quite blatantly.
Betalist is a great option if you have a private beta or beta product. Back when I started with Sean Fee & Mak Sok with Player.me, ProductHunt didn’t exist. We relied on Betalist to bring in our initial seed of users, and they delivered!
They get a very good reach (much better than when we worked with them over a year ago) and there’s a very good chance that you can get your first 200 to 500 users almost immediately from their email blast or if it gets traction and gets featured.
Two of the very best ones in terms of reach are ProductHunt and HackerNews.
ProductHunt is almost exclusively an audience of tech people, but it’s a big audience. With ProductHunt you’re almost guaranteed to get a few hundred users if you’re on the main daily list. If you reach the top 3, you’ll blaze past 1,000 users in no time — assuming you’re product is good.
Similarly with HackerNews if you end up in the top 3 you’ll have a similar result. But with HackerNews if your product isn’t good, you’ll hear it loud and clear.
Some tips to make your experience with these sites better:
A) Make sure you have friends ready to help you by upvoting the post — a vote could be the difference between a few hundred visitors and a few thousand coming to your site, so every vote counts
B) Engage and answer comments, the last thing people want to see if a bunch of questions on a post with no answers — it turns people off and leads to less organic upvotes
An alternative to all of this is PromoteHour. They have a list of all of the startup submission sites you’d ever need, but for a small fee they’ll do the promotion for you.
Local newspapers love hearing about local startups and local businesses. All you have to do is reach out to them with a relatively unique story about what you’re doing with your business. Focus on the mission of your business and the pain killer — you can leverage this later on for more reach through radio stations, local TV stations and more if it’s compelling.
If you’ve taken the time to get local press, then leverage that to get national or international press. If some other publication found you interesting, you have a better shot at a national publication.
The alternative is a press release. It may seem like a really old school, outdated way of doing things, but they flat out work (same as direct mail). Write a simple press release highlighting your key disruptors or your pain killer and submit that to multiple press release distribution channels. There’s a bunch of free options here and paid options here.
For free channels it’s all about hustle, there’s about a dozen good ones that can get you some reach and even Google News placement.
For paid distribution, there’s many, many ways you can go. SBWire and PRWeb are the two I’ve used most often. Every single press release we shoot out gets Google News placement and lots of traffic — great for SEO backlinks. But the cool thing is both of these paid channels can also send that info to national TV and radio stations for you, along with a bucket of magazines and newspapers.
Use Google news to find journalists that are already writing about companies in your market. Build a list of 100 to 200 of those journalists, whatever contact info you can find and the article you found them on. Now that you have some details, it’s time to enrich that data and get their email addresses and Twitter handle (if you haven’t already).
MTurk is great way to source the email and Twitter data, but you can also turn to Fiverr. Five bucks should get you 15–30 rows of data enrichment.
Now that you have some contact info, reach out to each journalist individually. Point out something you liked in their article (or make some type of rapport building one liner) and give them the simple, bare bones pitch of your company with everything they’d need to take action on it.
Here’s a GREAT guide by Justin Wilcox that dives deeper into automating this.
Look for relevant groups of people that would be your target market in Facebook groups, Google+ communities or Linkedin groups. What you want to do is interact and build some trust in these groups. Then you’ll be able to leverage that trust and authority to reach out individually to those who have engaged with your post.
To get started, simply start replying to questions in the group. People love to ask questions that can often be found with a simple Google search, just copy their question, paste it into Google and return a reformatted result. Nice, easy and simple authority building.
Once you’ve got some trust built up it’s time to start posting and engaging. A simple way is to offer value in a simple text or video post and at the end offer a mini-content upgrade that is only sent out one to one via private message.
After you’ve delivered the promise in the private chat, you can continue the conversation to try and get them on your platform, introduce them to the company and see if they are ready and willing to come on board.
If you’re already at a stage where there is a paid version of the SaaS product, you can go for a joint venture.
The way this works is really simple, you can reach out to the group owner and ask them to do joint venture or partnership. The works best if you’re able to and willing to do a revenue split with the group owner based on the number of users they bring into your product. Think of it like a very simple MVP of an affiliate program.
It’s a really simple process. You’re really just reaching out and saying, “Hey, I have this awesome product. The revenue model on it is _______. What I’d like to do is partner with you and leverage the audience that you already have, who are my ideal customer, to bring them into our platform. What I’m going to do for you is I’m going to make it really easy for you by doing all of the work. You just have to copy and paste some messages and then I’m going to give you a percentage of revenue based on what sells.
Really simple, really easy.
Look at sites like Meetup.com and the classified ads (or just search Google — I’m sure someone’s made a market relevant post) to find groups who hold events where your target market would be.
Once you’ve found your events, research the attendee list and identify key people that you’d like to meet at those events. Then, talk with the event organizer before hand by email or through on-site messages and ask if you can greet them at the event.
When you arrive at the event, you want to greet the event organizer and leverage his influence to get introduction to the people that you actually want to meet. It’s going to make it really easy and it’s going to make that transition process really quick for you. Aim at a five minute conversation where you learn about them and their work first, then related their answer to your SaaS to make it sound like a perfect fit.
For example, if they’re a real estate agent, and you provide a better way to capture seller leads — when they ask you what you do, you’re answer would sound something like this: “funny you should ask, I run a software platform that helps realtors capture 30–50% more seller leads from their existing social media audience. If you’re up for giving it a shot, I can email you a link to get 30 days on the platform for free. What’s your email?”
Even better, make a mini-landing page that asks for the basic info you need. Then you can just whip out your phone and tell them to enter their info to get the link right to their email instantly.
Many SaaS companies have grown from blogs, simply because it’s a really easy way to build an audience, identify a problem and immediately monetize the solution.
If you’re consistent in outputting content, meaning you’re putting out content on regular schedule (ie. twice a week or every Monday), and you’re really consistent about delivering value — you can build an engaged audience.
What you’ll want to do is write long form (+2,000 words), high value content (teach something) that’s actionable and you’re bound to build a really engaged and attentive audience. The type of audience that tells you their problems, gives you feedback and can be the seed you need to build a profitable SaaS business in no time.
If you’re going to go the content marketing route, a super quick way to promote your content is on social media, in the same relevant groups that you reach out to in step five.
Some other easy steps to promote your content are: reach out to influencers when it make sense, if you’re able to mention them in your post and ask for a share. Alternatively, you can simply promote it to your email list, as you build your content you build your recurring audience.
A key with content marketing is you’ll want to leverage email opt-ins and content upgrades to build your email list. As you build this list, be sure to on-board every single person to learn about them, their struggles and where you can provide value (through content or otherwise). If you learn about your audience, you’ll have an engage audience that will actually buy stuff when you want to sell stuff to them.
Check out the banner to the right, or this link to learn everything you need to know about content marketing for tech companies and entrepreneurs.
It should be one of your first priorities after the MVP features you need to go live. If you’ve worked out the referral or growth engine for your SaaS product, once you seed the engine with any of the above strategies, you’ll have a snowball effect on your hands.
Ensure you’re making the referral process really, REALLY easy for people. Make it simple for them to tap into or invite their entire network into your platform. If you can incentivize them, do that.
Your goal with this growth engine is to make it as easy as possible, and as appealing as possible for people to take action and let you tap into their networks.

How Figma rose above other design tools even after entering the market late
It is safe to say that the entire design and product community is excited about Figma. But how did Figma make itself a dominant tool for every designer and, more importantly, the tech giants that employ hundreds of designers for their product features? Let’s dig into this topic and understand how Figma applied the…

Marc Andreessen once famously said “Software is eating the world.” I think SaaS is eating the software world. Goodbye legacy software models.
The revenue model is better. The sales strategy is better. The products are better. The customers are happier.
Or are they?
For your SaaS business to work you need to retain and monetize your customers. You can add millions of users, but if they churn, or aren’t willing to pay you, you’ve failed.
While endless playbooks exist to help SaaS companies acquire customers, no one’s written the playbook on what companies need to do to create truly happy & valuable customers.
We chose CEOs for this guide because, simply put, you’re responsible for customer happiness. You can’t just hope that everyone cares about your customers. No, you need to lead by example. Everything flows from you.
I believe you need to commit to be a customer-driven business if you really want to drive customer happiness.
You have to create the approach to customer engagement, service, and measurement of satisfaction, and then you and your team will execute. If you don’t prioritize making customers happy, no one else will.
We’ve partnered with my friend Patrick Campbell, CEO of Price Intelligently, to create this brief read on what we think you should be doing to create happier customers.
Today I am sharing the entire book here.
No hoops, no lead forms, no nonsense.
I believe we’re all growing tired of the “leadgen” playbooks of the last decade and invite you to do the same with the content you create, set it Free. Your current and future customers will love you for it.
I hope this is helpful and would love to hear any feedback you have.
You can find the PDF, MOBI and EPUB versions of the book here.

Hi there, we’re Point Nine Capital a VC firm focused on SaaS and marketplaces. If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
The paths to financing a SaaS company are getting more diverse than ever. I regularly have discussions with early-stage founders about how they should fund their startups and what is the best option in respect of their experience, ambition, personal aspirations, type of product and the market they target.
I summed up many of the aspects discussed on a map (see below) where you’ll find six paths, broken down into four stages (Idea, MVP, Revenue, Scale). Following the map, you’ll find first a brief description of each scenario, and then I share a framework of questions that you can use to choose your way.
A mature ecosystem
Before jumping into covering the different paths, and in order not to repeat myself throughout the post, I briefly want to describe the current SaaS environment. We’re operating in a mature environment at several levels (nothing new here):
It’s important to keep this context in mind because it explains a lot of the recent evolutions that I cover below.
A “classic” journey to building a SaaS company: you have an idea, create a MVP and then go and see VCs to fund your journey.
What has changed in the past years?
#1- A higher bar. A first noticeable change is that the bar to raise at the “Revenue” stage has increased quite a bit. There’s more and more competition among startups and VCs are more and more demanding. If a couple of years ago a simple MVP was enough to convince them, now you need to show more traction, more revenue and better product metrics to raise at that stage. It’s getting tougher.
#2- Skipping the seed round. The second noticeable change is an increasing number of companies skipping the seed round to raise their first VC round at the Scale stage. Because of the maturity of the market, it becomes more common for SaaS companies to reach the $5M — $10M ARR range without taking any VC money. They can then raise at much better conditions.
Many founders prefer not to take VC money. The key here is to have a short path to monetization to self-finance this journey. Bootstrapping a SaaS has always been possible, but due to the market maturity, it’s more viable than ever.
What has changed in the past years?
A wider spectrum. First, there’s a broader variety of bootstrapped companies nowadays: from “side project” types of company that will generate a couple of hundred dollars per month to medium-sized companies with tens of employees, and companies at the Scale stage with hundreds of employees and making tens of millions of ARR. There’s an explosion of such businesses (look at the listing on Indie Hackers), and it will continue.
A stronger community. Second, a robust “bootstrap community” has emerged. From Microconf to Indie Hackers or Stripe Atlas, the number of high-quality projects and communities to support founders is impressive.
First of all I didn’t coin this term; I read it first on Colin Nederkoorn (customer.io CEO) article. “Fundstrapping” means that a company has raised money (for equity and from a couple of hundreds of thousands of dollars to $2M / $3M max) early on, generally at the MVP stage or when they generate a bit of revenue. However they operate like a bootstrapped company: they don’t focus on growing as fast as possible, but rather on building a business that generates enough revenue to be self-financed as soon as possible. They raise money to help start the business, but don’t go on raising subsequent rounds as it is the norm.
What has changed in the past years?
It is the trickiest paths of all, and I wouldn’t advise people to go down that road. Why? Because it can result in a lot of frictions if both parties are not aligned. Most VCs’ business model is to invest in companies in the hope that they’ll grow fast and become the winner of their category (or get acquired). Which can lead to problems if the founders decide to focus on profitability too early.
This is not a value judgment, and I’m not saying that it’s something bad “per se”. I’m just saying that founders should be very cautious if they want to avoid potential problems down the road. There are a few success stories with this scenario out there, but I also know that several of the founders in that situation became frustrated with their investors once they started to generate significant revenue (a.k.a they would like to get rid of their investors but it’s not so easy).
I think it’s an option to consider only if you:
This path is not common. It mainly happens:
What has changed in the past years?
I haven’t noticed significant changes there.
The past years have seen the emergence of debt financing. It can be explained by the nature of the SaaS model (metrics driven + relatively predictable once you have a running business, so a good target for debt) and by the new “gaps” in the market which have appeared.
What has changed in the recent years?
Debt at the Revenue stage. I see an increasing number of SaaS companies taking debt at the Revenue stage. It can be either because they couldn’t secure money from VCs or because they just need some cash upfront to invest in their product or sales and don’t want to sacrifice equity for that.
Debt at the Scale stage. This scenario is also more common: instead of taking VC money at the Scale stage founders prefer to keep their equity and take debt instead. They grow nicely but are not interested in the “hypergrowth” mode.
I expect both scenarios to become more common. As we saw previously, the bar to raise VC money at the Revenue stage is getting higher. VCs are more demanding, but at the same time, there’s an increasing number of SaaS companies which are not “VC compatible” or founders that don’t want to sacrifice equity for cash. It creates a gap in the market that debt providers are filling.
Bootstrapping, debt and venture capital are not incompatible. In the past months, I saw several companies going down that path. Especially in “crowded” software categories where VCs are less willing to bet on companies at the Revenue stage, but ready to back the emerging champions once they reach the Scale level.
Maybe you’ll ask yourself what’s the point of taking VC money once you’ve managed to reach that stage. Well, it’s because VCs also bring much more than money (network, branding, recruiting execs, etc.) that are valuable at that stage.
If you’re unsure of which path to follow here are some questions that can help you in your thinking process. The list is not exhaustive, please let me know in the comments other questions that should be added.

我在前一篇文章 Slack — 有關 Slack 上市和一些 Slack 的故事 有一段是講 Slack 的營運數字。
文章發布後，想再寫文提一下 Slack 很重視的幾個 Key Business Metrics。Slack 的 S1 有提到他們公司有三個 Key Business Metrics，以作為公司衡量自己表現、判斷趨勢、作財務預測、策略決定。
三個主要營運指標是：付費用戶數、付費大於 10 萬的客戶數、Net Dollar Retention Rate (淨收入留存率)。我想特別介紹一下 Net dollar retention rate。
medium.com
儘管 Net dollar retention rate (淨收入留存率) 並不是一個美國會計準則 GAAP 對上市公司要求公開的數字，但這是許多不同營運模式的 SaaS 公司認為的一個很重要的經營評量指標。
在 Slack 的 S1 的不同章節中，Net Dollar Retention Rate 總共被提到 48 次。Slack 希望能維持或增加 Net dollar retention rate，因這數字能顯示 Slack 付費訂閱用戶長期的價值，及衡量留住並增加付費用戶營收的能力。
Slack 的 Net dollar retention rate 的計算方式是:
本期 MRR / 前期MRR
前期 MRR: 本期付費用戶在 12 個月前的付費收入本期 MRR: 同一群客戶在本期的付費收入（不包含新付費用戶或前期免費客戶升為付費客戶）
不同公司計算 Net retention 和採用的營收指標略有不同，有的用 ARR, 有的用 ACV 來計算，但都大同小異，就是看舊用戶的持續付費能力。
Slack 的 Net dollar retention rate 從 2017、2018、2019 年分別是 171%, 152%, 143%。
Zoom 前兩年沒計算(Zoom 的 S1 是稱 Net dollar expansion rate)，2019 是 140%。
Slack 說明，因為每一個前期的付費用戶收入的基數越來越大，所以 Net dollar retention rate 數字逐年往下降。不過 Slack、Zoom 這兩家都超過 140% 的數字，在 SaaS 公司裡面，都算頂尖的。
各家 SaaS 服務 Net Dollar Retention 的業界標準
下面這篇 Blossom Street Ventures 在 CrunchBase 的文章: What’s a Good Level of Net Dollar Retention? 提到，如果在 100% 左右的 Net dollar retention 是算表現不錯，如果低於 75%，就要趕快檢視經營上有沒有問題。
about.crunchbase.com
上面這篇文章為最近幾年上市的 SaaS 公司在 S1 中提到的 Net Retention 製表，比較各家的數字，如果把 Slack 和 Zoom 的數字帶入，是前一兩名的：
訂閱服務 Zuora 寫文介紹 Net Retention 的計算和學習到的經驗
訂閱服務 SaaS 工具的上市公司 Zuora，有一篇介紹 Net Retention 的文章: NET RETENTION: HOW HAS THE GAME CHANGED?
Zuora 這篇文章提到，當一家公司知道自己有高的 Net Retention Rate，可視作一個有競爭力的武器，因為代表用戶的 LTV (Life-Time Value) 夠高，公司可以再大膽地投入業務及行銷資源。
如果有興趣更深入了解一些高成長的 SaaS 公司怎麼計算 Net Retention Rate，Zuora 的文章中有介紹幾個不同類型 SaaS 公司的計算方式。更重要的是，如何從這個數字來比較公司的 sales efficiency，是否可以投入更多預算在取得新客戶(customer acquisition)。
網路上也有人製作了一個強大的 Spreadsheet，共列出了 40 多家公司的 Net Dollar Retention 的計算和定義方式可以參考。
好的 Net Dollar Retention Rate，可讓你上天堂
這篇: SaaS IPO Net Dollar Retention Benchmarks 也是對 Net dollar retention 做了比較詳細的解釋和比較。
不同公司根據自己的 business model，可能從增加用戶、增加用戶付費、賣新產品或包裹銷售新服務、更新銷售合約把收費提高等等讓用戶掏更多的錢。文中也引 Atlassian 上市時的 S1 資料作為範例，Atlassian 用戶在第一年花 $1 來算，五年後客戶持續並增加付費給 Atlassian 的數字是第一年的 7 倍。
結語
綜合以上的一些美國 SaaS 公司分享，在計算 Net Dollar Retention 前，需先檢視自己收費方式，好比服務是以月費訂閱制，或是專案客製簽年約、或有不同產品包套銷售方式..等等，再以自己服務的營收指標作為計算 Net Dollar Retention Rate 的根據。有了數字後，可觀察是靠什麼在驅動公司的 Net Retention 數字變化？觀察個別用戶是因什麼而增加或減少付費，如何將用戶行為分群。再將這些觀察有系統地反應到未來營運決策上。
有關 Net Dollar Retention Rate 的中文談論似乎不多，希望能再和有在關心 SaaS 服務相關的營運指標的朋友學習交流囉。

Every entrepreneur, operator and investor active in the enterprise and SaaS space has heard of Sales Efficiency metrics such as Magic Number, CAC Payback and LTV/CAC.
Once at growth stage, Sales Efficiency or Unit Economics is one of the most important quantitative metrics that can help you determine whether you have a viable business, course correct as needed, and help inform various facets of strategy.
Yet, given the many challenges around measuring it consistently, the subjectivity involved, and confusing messaging around so many SaaS metrics, many tend to underestimate its importance.
Some focus only on the unit economics per sales person, which is necessary, but not sufficient.
Subscription oriented businesses lose more money the faster they grow, especially at the scaling stage (~$5M+ ARR, repeatable sales model in place). This, as we know, is because such businesses need to spend a significant amount of capital up front to hire and train sales people, then acquire and set up customers, and recoup value over time as the customer pays the monthly or annual subscription fee. Given the time difference between when the CAC investment (S&M expense) is made, and when the returns (contribution profits) are generated, high growth subscription businesses require significant upfront investment in customer acquisition. The more customers a SaaS business acquires, the deeper the total trough of losses.
The losses typically accelerate as the business grows from $5M ARR to $50M ARR, and looks to add higher levels of ACV each year. A rapidly growing SaaS business could have a rising burn rate for a good reason — the business is acquiring customers fast, and these customers will eventually be profitable for the business. However, a company could also be incurring heavy losses if it has an unviable business, via sub-optimal product/market fit, an inefficient sales or marketing organization, acquisition of marginal customers, operating in unprofitable geographies or inadequate pricing.
Every CEO, management team member and board member of a SaaS or B2B company that is losing money needs to understand very clearly which one of the above it is.
It is paramount to understand whether you would deliver returns on capital invested on customer acquisition — just like any other investment you would make in your personal or professional life. The Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) needs to eventually generate sufficient return on the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), to offset R&D and G&A expenses, reinvest into growth, and eventually generate profits. The commonly accepted rule of thumb, especially amongst venture investors and venture-funded companies, has been that of LTV/CAC > 3X for building a sustainable business. This benchmark has a good reason, and we illustrate this with data below. A simple explanation is as follows. For SaaS businesses at scale (~$100m revenues), R&D and G&A together typically average at 30–35% of revenues, down from higher % numbers earlier in the life of the company. CoGS/variable expenses average at another 30–35% of revenues. The predominant swing expense at that point is typically Sales and Marketing. An LTV = 3X CAC (or S&M = 1/3 of contribution margins) leaves about a sixth of revenues as capital for reinvestment into growth, and eventually profits.
To illustrate the impact of Sales Efficiency on business viability and capital intensity, we model a hypothetical SaaS company that ended the prior year with $5M ARR, and targets getting to $100M ARR by end of Year 5 (a commonly accepted threshold for considering an IPO or large M&A). We assume R&D and G&A expense trajectory in line with a basket of public comps, starting at levels consistent with Series B or C stage startups, and approaching an aggregate of 35% of revenues at $100M revenue run rate. We made market-based assumptions for contribution margins (70%) and simple assumptions for annual logo churn (12%) and dollar churn (-5%). Contribution margins adjust for not only typical CoGS items but also any account management and retention related expenses. We use the undiscounted LTV for the purposes of this analysis. We capped the customer lifetime at five years for the purpose of LTV calculation, and modeled various scenarios with different levels of LTV/CAC. We then made assumptions for S&M spend in each scenario such that the company achieves $100M in ARR at the end of Year 5.
The growth trajectory of our hypothetical future unicorn is consistent with that of many successful SaaS companies that have gone public over the past several years:
While each of our scenarios has a similar growth cadence (and hence overlapping curves in the chart above), let’s look at the S&M expenses required to generate this trajectory for each scenario.
With our aforementioned trajectory of assumptions for other expenses, the EBITDA numbers look as follows for this company at various levels of Sales Efficiency.
The difference between scenarios is stark. With an LTV/CAC of 4X, our hypothetical company is close to EBITDA profitability in Year 6 with $116M GAAP revenues, while with LTV/CAC of 2X, the company is still losing $45M a year, or nearly $4M per month in Year 6!
Now let’s look at the Capital Intensity in each scenario. The chart below shows the cumulative losses during the first five years after $5M ARR for this company. This analysis ignores the impact of up-front cash collections/deferred revenue and stock based compensation expense for simplicity. These vary significantly by company, but the trend below will hold after these adjustments.
With an LTV/CAC of 4X, the company requires $80M and gets to profitability in Year 6, while with 2X, the company requires over $180M in Years 1–5, and is still losing $45M per year in Year 6. This difference not only has a significant impact on returns for founders, employees and investors, but also brings to question viability of the company in scenarios where LTV/CAC is under 3X. While many kinds of companies are able to raise financing at preferred terms in bull markets, in normalized market conditions it would be hard for the company to continue raising private financing to fund its large losses during Years 1–5 in the first two scenarios above. On the other hand, in the last two scenarios above, the company may choose to continue to grow faster in Years 4 and beyond if it sees a large market opportunity.
We have used LTV/CAC as the primary Sales Efficiency metric here, and similar analyses can be conducted using other metrics such as CAC Payback and Magic Number. LTV/CAC, while harder to accurately measure, is more comprehensive and predictive.
At any given point of time, a business can choose to grow faster by deploying more capital into Sales and Marketing. But this only makes sense as long as this is done while maintaining the right Sales Efficiency. The growth rate and organizational processes (sales hiring, incentivize structures, focus on cross-sells and up-sell, customer targeting, conversion funnels, lead sources) need to be tempered and monitored closely to keep the overall company-level LTV/CAC in a healthy operating zone.
Based on looking at numerous growth stage subscription-oriented businesses over the years, here are my observations and recommendations based on Sales Efficiency, as evidenced by LTV/CAC. The absolute levels will vary by specific nature of business, current stage and other factors.
In a later post, we will touch upon some of the practical challenges and common errors with measuring Sales Efficiency, and share best practices we have seen around this. Here are is a summary of some key items I recommend — Customer Lifetime Value should be calculated net of all variable costs including customer service, retention expenses, hosting fees and any others; For calculating real churn rates for businesses with annual customer contracts, use renewal rates rather than churn rates, which may artificially look lower; Use customer cohorts for understanding account expansion rates; For the purposes of the LTV/CAC calculation, cap the customer lifetime to a reasonable number, as no business is likely to have a customer lifetime of decades across its customer base in this era of rapid disruption cycles.
Recommendation
Given the aforementioned implications of Sales Efficiency on company viability and returns on invested capital and time, CEOs, management teams and boards would be well served by taking a close look at this metric as they finalize their strategy and budgets for 2017 and beyond.

LogMeIn started with a remote access product in the early 2000s, and quickly began to build and acquire other products focused on technology that simplifies how people interact with each other and the world around them.
Today, their impressive portfolio of companies includes GoToMeeting, LastPass, join.me, and Grasshopper.
“LogMeIn’s story is not atypical. In the early days, our products won markets with the technical capabilities and design wasn’t a major factor. As we’ve scaled, the design team has had to break a lot of older patterns to help the entire organization see the value design brings to the table. We’ve also done a lot of work in terms of getting the customer experience right.” — Tim O’Brien, Director of Product Design, LogMeIn
I sat down with O’Brien to learn how design has been key to remaining competitive in saturated markets, how they successfully manage design for a multitude of products, and more.
LogMeIn began as the RemotelyAnywhere app (with a name change in 2006) and was one of the first providers of remote access for Information Technology (IT) professionals.
The product was an industry game-changer.
Previously, IT professionals would have to drive several hours to a client’s location and sit down at their server to make any changes; however, once LogMeIn entered the scene, those same people could suddenly fix issues on their clients’ servers from the comfort of their own home — or even working from the beach.
LogMeIn also introduced a freemium model to the market long before it was a common SaaS pricing tactic.
“Translating how design solves customer problems into something the C-Suite understands is a key component of elevating design within an organization.”
Between the pricing and innovative solution, LogMeIn’s IT users were willing to overlook any design shortcomings because of the product’s technical capabilities; however, as the markets became more saturated, it was no longer enough for LogMeIn to have a freemium offer or products with superior technical capabilities.
“We had to invest in product design and experience to remain competitive,” explains O’Brien.
Related: 4 reasons to invest in UX design
O’Brien started with LogMeIn in 2014 as an Innovation Catalyst in the company’s Innovation Lab. During his career with the company, he has headed product design for every product in the company’s portfolio.
The factors described above created a situation in which the company’s internal design competency was low and design catch-up was needed within the organization as a whole.
Initially, design within the company followed a more classic SaaS playbook: User interface (UI) designers were embedded in developer Scrum teams and created assets for the developers who needed them.
The first step to reorganizing design was to break those patterns of classic SaaS design thinking, says O’Brien.
“We had to hire a different type of designer who was more in charge of influencing the organization’s design thinking competency.”
They also hired user experience (UX) researchers to join the design team:
“Great UX researchers brought new capabilities to the design team by doing customer visits, managing co-design sessions, and running user surveys. Our researchers’ insights help influence product strategy,” explains O’Brien.
“Translating how design solves customer problems into something the C-Suite understands is a key component of how we start to elevate design within an organization.” — TS Balaji, Vice President Product Design & Customer Experience, LogMeIn
Designers across many industries struggle with getting a seat at the leadership table to have a voice in which products are designed and how they’re designed.
In LogMeIn’s case, O’Brien points to the company hiring TS Balaji as an important step in both getting executive buy-in and spreading design beyond the borders of the design team; Balaji’s background in psychology, computer science, engineering, and design helped when speaking to the engineers at LogMeIn.
“A common language is important to be able to translate your designs and helps others in the organization understand what you’re bringing to the table from a design point of view.” Having a common language also helps design leaders engage with stakeholders so they see the value in bringing design to the table.
Hear more insights from Balaji in the TS Balaji: representing design with a multidisciplinary approach DesignBetter.Co Podcast.
“Designers across industries struggle to get a seat at the leadership table.”
LogMeIn currently has more than 15 products in its portfolio, which creates unique design challenges.
At one point, O’Brien headed product design for all companies in the portfolio, but due to the different focus and maturity level of each product they found it more efficient to organize product sets into Business Unit [BU] structures:
Each BU is led by a Director of Product Design and a blend of designers and researchers, all focused on their specific product sets. The design teams are distributed and use InVision to collaborate seamlessly across time zones.
“We’re also heavily invested in Craft libraries for design team collaboration. Craft libraries allow all our design teams to deliver consistent assets to our developers.”
LogMeIn’s design process consists of dual agile tracks:
During the discovery phase, the team conducts customer research and solution brainstorming to ensure design is prioritized by the most impactful work. Their close proximity to customers and actively monitoring the market helps them avoid mistakes early in the process and avoid mistakes in the delivery.
“The first step to reorganizing design is to break patterns of classic SaaS design thinking.”
The delivery phase is a traditional agile environment with 1 to 2-week sprints. LogMeIn runs usability tests throughout this phase to ensure they’re designing for a problem users are actually experiencing:
“At LogMeIn, we have the luxury of getting customers’ eyes on a product before code is written. The most costly thing we could do is to wait to get customer feedback after shipping.”
O’Brien also brought in UX expert Leah Buley to consult with the design team (full disclosure: Buley is currently Director of Design Education at InVision). He credits her advice as the catalyst to important changes in how they viewed design:
“Leah advised us to move from a reactive department to a proactive department.”
She also recommended design leaders stop viewing design in terms of production costs “and start being a value generator by measuring design’s impact in terms of how we can change behavioral metrics that end up leading to improved business metrics.”
Buley’s input inspired design thinking changes within the organization and new design processes; for instance, design leaders introduced a “one pager methodology” to kickoff all new design projects.

“We use the one pager to describe what the project is and how we’ll define success for the project. It also hypothesizes how behavioral metrics will change as a result of the project and how those changes will affect the overall business metrics,” explains O’Brien.
So, how can other design leaders begin to implement change at their own companies?
Get a quick win.
“Find a project that has the potential to be exceptional and then over-deliver on it.”
O’Brien gives this example: Say you have a project where it becomes clear you’re in need of a UX researcher on the design team. Perhaps “you’re going to do a migration and there’s no going back once the data is migrated, or you’re concerned about a one-way decision on an upcoming product buildout.”
“Just coming out and asking for a research department is usually not going to work,” he points out.
Instead, start with a smaller ask. For this example, O’Brien explains you might have a designer who has an aptitude for research that you could send to training or you could hire a contractor.
“Muster the resources and then apply the skill set to the problem.”
Your goal is to be right and over-deliver on the project. Don’t stop there, says O’Brien: “Once you have success, talk about the benefit of adding the UX research resource…or whatever it was you mustered the resources for. It’s important to talk about your success over and over so that it becomes part of your organization’s larger story.”
“How can you get a quick win? Find a project that has the potential to be exceptional and then over-deliver on it.”
When LogMeIn hired their own researchers to work alongside designers, they started with a few hires but then needed to share the successes of those hires for other departments in the company (and executives) to understand the power of their contributions.
“You have to find that story and talk about it a lot to anyone who’s willing to listen.”
Turning those smaller asks into big wins and telling the success story throughout the organization also helps design leaders spread design beyond the borders of their team. Doing so is important to help the wider organization understand the value design brings to the overall success of the company.

Be the first to respond.
Last year in my 2016 predictions post one of the trends to watch was “B2B Vertical Software”. Since I’ve been asked for an update here’s my take for 2017.
If you want to be kept informed of our next posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel
This is an aspect that hasn’t change in the past years. If you want to succeed within a vertical (agriculture tech, legal tech…) you still need to deeply understand every facet of this industry. From its macro components such as the global value chain to more specific aspects such as people behavior and habits. “Why Did Beepi Fail? What Does It Mean For Online Car Sales?” illustrates really well how not deeply understanding the specificities of a market can kill a company, even if it has raised tens of millions $.
It doesn’t mean that you must have worked in a particular vertical / industry to launch your company but rather that if you don’t initially have enough industry knowledge you need to hire (or get surrounded by) insiders and you also need to do your homework and build this knowledge yourself. Speaking from a VC standpoint it’s crucial for us to see founders who are experts in their field and if not, who show an above the average appetite for learning and analyzing.
One of the main allures of launching a vertical software is the opportunity to disrupt old school incumbents that have been here for years and are not innovating anymore. Hence the common theme of bringing user friendly software in low digitized industries. But the situation is changing fast and in many industries traditional players are not just sitting ducks but are now fighting back. They’ve been warned enough that they risk to be “Uberized”.
What Kyle Hill wrote in “There’s No Magic in Venture-Backed Home Care“ particularly struck me:
“We underestimated the ability for home care agencies to adopt new technology. A majority of the 20,000 home care agencies are financially efficient, software enabled and have entrenched relationships within their local communities. While file cabinets are still popular, they are not sitting in the stone ages with technology.“
Whether it’s old school incumbents or smaller scale traditional players (agencies, consulting firms, cabinets…) don’t underestimate their capacity to evolve and to use the very weapons that are threatening them. This trend will probably accelerate in the months / years to come.
It’s more a consequence of the previous two points than really a standalone one but applying “out of the box” the playbook of successful horizontal software companies (whether it’s for product, sales, marketing or else) can kill you. You need to adapt the myriad of learnings shared online to your particular vertical.
I spoke about this topic in depth here but we’re entering the age of big B2B horizontal software platforms. Companies such as Salesforce, Hubspot or Docusign are now building ecosystems of third party tools around their core software. And this is a game changer for vertical B2B startups.
The main reason is that there are more and more opportunities to build “verticalized” versions or smaller addons for these platforms. Instead of building a CRM software from scratch for a specific industry you can built it on top of Salesforce platform directly by adding the missing / specific features required. This is what Veeva did for the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries and it’s now a public company worth Billions of $. But it’s also true for smaller vertical startups which build and monetize smaller Salesforce “addons”.
These platforms can be a great shortcut not only to build vertical software but also for distribution. You might argue that the main risk is to be copied by the platforms themselves. Well it’s true but for the vast majority of niches it makes no sense for a platform operator to copy you, simply because the revenue generated is not needle moving for them.
I believe that we’ll see more and more bootstrapped and profitable vertical software companies because:
A great illustration of these points is the story of Distrokid a software that helps musician “get their music into iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, Google Play, and more”.

Today, there is 1 $100B+ SaaS Company, Salesforce. Just one. We could add older companies like Adobe, Microsoft, etc. but they aren’t pure SaaS plays. Salesforce is the “only” $100b+ pure-play SaaS company.
But it won’t be the last. There are 15 more at $10B+ or close to it:
That’s enough that as crazy as it sounds, not only can you plan on becoming a Unicorn after say $10m ARR. You can now actually dream of building a $100b+ SaaS company. After all, while there is just 1 today, there are another 15+ working on it.
So let’s dig into some really interesting metrics and facts that Salesforce and other $10b+ companies have … that you can emulate and plan on:
Probably we can’t all build $100B+ SaaS companies. But it’s no longer crazy to dream of it:

Top highlight
Having a ‘solid’ user onboarding experience on a SaaS product is particularly important. First because most SaaS users try a new software in the hope of finding a useful tool that’ll make them more productive (usefulness vs fun). Second because they generally try it during “work” time, meaning that they will spend as little time as possible to understand it. Third because the SaaS landscape starts to be really crowded and chances are high that your user has many other options available if he doesn’t understand the value you deliver in less than 5 minutes.
Onboardings are useful for:
This is the most obvious goal of a product onboarding: explain to a new user what your product is and teach him how to get started with it.
The challenges
As “obvious” as it may sounds, it’s not that easy to craft a good “getting started” process. Explaining clearly the value that your product delivers and how it does can be quite complicated.
Here are some common traps in which we fall:
A good way to avoid these problems is to group your features into different categories (“core features”, “power user features”…) and to limit yourself to the ones which have the potential to “hook” your user. Your product is like a drug, once your user is hooked he’ll come back to you and as any good drug dealer you’ll be able to make him discover more features later.
Concerning the “format” you’ll find many examples of great user onboarding teardowns on useronboard. The options are endless: video tutorial, interactive step-by-step onboarding, passive tutorial (only content), active ones (the user has to perform actions in order to go to the next step) etc. You’ll also find many tools that will help you create these “step by step” tutorials like mytips.co, walkme or directly on GitHub.
When designing Aircall’s onboarding, we struggled a lot with all possible features we could show: customize your voicemail and waiting music, play with the cascading order of your call forwarding, import and share Google contacts, collaborative features, etc.
The best onboardings we’ve seen were when the product itself showed the user how to use it. Slack has done an awesome job here.
So when a new user arrives on Aircall we first emphasize the simplicity and speed with which you can set up an Aircall number. With 5 super-simple popins like “What’s your company name?”, “Who will take the call on this number?”.
Then for the rest of the features we decided to show to the user real “life” examples directly within the product. For example we create right at the end of the onboarding a 1st voicemail on the user’s number. We also create a “virtual” contact (Lisa, our Support Diva) that we place directly into the user’s contact list, so he gets to see how contacts work (sharing, commenting…).
This is an aspect which is strongly bound to SaaS products: having the user to install / set up a component before he can use the product.
Examples :
There are two cases: the setup is compulsory (Google analytics snippet) or it’s not but the user experience might not be perfect (ex: DKIM / SPF setup which you don’t need to send emails but which are important to avoid being considered as spam).
In either case, as these setups are crucial, the onboarding stage is a very good time to ask your user to complete them.
The challenges
The end user and the person who can complete the setup are not the same. Typically the case for analytics tools: marketers are the end users and they cannot install the javascript snippet themselves.
This is a VERY hard problem on which a lot of SaaS struggle. How can I onboard a user if he cannot use my product “out” of the box?
If the setup is not “compulsory” then you can still let the user enter and try your interface but you should keep reminding him that the user experience will be optimal once he’ll complete the steps required (reminders via emails, in-app notifications etc…)
If it’s compulsory then you should really think about a strategy to lower the friction as much as possible.
Intercom has a quite interesting (and radical) approach as they ask you upfront if you can do the setup yourself or not. If not, you need to provide the email of the right person to contact.
Ultimately the question is “can you provide this minimal value that will hook the user without having this setup completed?” if yes, then allow him to enter. If not, then you should think about it.
The setup requires time. This is, for example, the case for a tool like Monitor Backlink. Once you’ve connected your Google analytics account, the seo tool takes 24 hours to analyse all the links and crawl them back. During this time you can use the dashboard but the experience is not optimal. Same thing for Mailjet. A DKIM / SPF change is generally not taken into account immediately and the user has to wait a couple of hours before he can send its emails.
You can still offer a “normal” onboarding here. The key is to make your user come back when its interface is ready.
Concerning Aircall we basically pre-configure many many things ‘under the hood’ during the onboarding process. And we inform the user only at the end of it that he can customize these components. That leads to a 5-step process (not that short :-)…which only takes on average 60 secs to complete and at the end of which the user gets an active phone number, cascading across various people and devices etc.
The “ghost town effect” concerns a wide range of SaaS: collaborative products, which are really useful only when your colleagues are also using it (ex: Yammer, Front, Slack), products collecting data (analytics, predictive sales tools…) which get better with more data, products relying on “contacts” (CRM etc.), and is simply the fact that some SaaS need data or other team members in order to be really useful from the start.
Since the user experience can be deceiving without it, the onboarding stage is generally a right moment to ask the user to act on it.
Challenges
There are three main challenges here:
Populating a product with data “automatically” has only gotten better with the years. Now SaaS makers can leverage many APIs in order to retrieve data and fight the “ghost town” effect. From the user’s social profiles (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook…) to data stream between apps (Google analytics API, Gmail API, SalesForce API, your phone contact book…) with a few clicks you can really enable your user to import a huge number of different data sets.
No, the real difficulty is to convince a first time user to click on that “invite my colleagues” button which will give you access to his gmail contacts. Unfortunately there is no magic bullet. It’s a mix of “brand” building (the more a user knows / trusts your brand the better) and of constantly reassuring the user about why you ask for this data and how it will be beneficial for him later on. The benefits you promise should exceed his fear.
Concerning invitation emails for other teammates the secret is to test as many email subjects and text as possible in order to discover what works for you.
Intercom has several great articles about these topics.
Another interesting challenge worth mentioning is the “admin” problem.
Very often SaaS products have two types of users: admins and regular users. These two types of users generally have the same set of core “features” but they also potentially see different interfaces, have different needs and perform different actions.
You can end up creating two different onboardings and these two onboardings can be both crucial for the success of your product.
For example on Aircall only admins have the right to create phone numbers. Regular users don’t. It’s a really important aspect of the product for this category of people (you want to choose the type of phone number, its location etc… and understand it from the start) and hence is really taken into account in our admin onboarding. A normal user won’t even see it.
These are all challenges we face and that we are trying to solve ourselves. We put a lot of effort iterating on this part of the product and we’ve already modified it quite a bit (we could see some real improvements on our metrics, so it’s definitely worth working on this aspect).
We’ve gone from a simple “static” onboarding for our MVP to an active step-by-step one shortly after and for our latest iteration we are trying a “voice” onboarding: users can choose to be guided through voice explanations.
We really don’t pretend that we’ve nailed it and that our onboarding is perfect (far from it). We just thought that having been through all this process it would be worth sharing our thoughts and learnings with the community.
Also as we are experiencing with a new kind of “voice” onboarding we would love to have your feedback and see how we can improve it, so don’t hesitate to try it and tell us what you think.

Top highlight
Nowadays, self-funded startups are still outnumbered by glamorous VC-backed startups. But over the past few years, a new trend is building outside of Silicon Valley: the rise of bootstrapped SaaS startups and “lifestyle businesses.”
We are proud to be part of this trend at Agorapulse. We’ve been building and designing a lean and agile off-road buggy, optimized for the long run and bumpy roads since 2010. Here is our story.
This is the second article of a two-part series. If you missed the previous article, it was all about nitro/VC powered dragsters, a brutal and epic race for growth and escape velocity.
MailChimp is probably the most emblematic bootstrapped business that has demonstrated the Un-Silicon Valley Way to Make It as a Start-Up.
Basecamp (aka 37Signals) has been one of the most vocal leaders in this startup (r)evolution with their REWORK manifesto published in 2010 by Jason Fried and DHH. They’ve proven that you can break all the established rules and win:
Micro-SaaS (or “lifestyle businesses”), operated by 1 or 2 people, usually do not require any initial cash to get started. They even have their own dedicated conference: http://www.microconf.com.
Bootstrapped startups (or “indie startups”), operated by real teams, might require some minimal initial cash from personal assets, business angel or seed funds to build and validate their Minimum Viable Product, but unlike their glamorous VC-funded counterparts, they don’t target VC funds after that.
Instead of focusing on chasing money and growing big enough to provide a return to investors, bootstrapped businesses focus on profitability, customer happiness and quality of life for their team.
A bootstrapper cannot start out with ideas of world domination and ambitions to “shoot for the moon.” Bootstrappers need to hit a feature set that resonates with their audience quickly by focusing like a laser on building only the features that directly address customer pain points.
Unless someone pays for the product, a bootstrapped startup is dead. That’s one of the main reasons why most of self-funded businesses start at the bottom of the market, selling subscriptions targeted at SMBs instead of enterprises which require a longer sales cycle and a heavy sales process.
Another founders’ top concern is talent acquisition. This is why most self-funded businesses can’t be bootstrapped in the Valley — it’s impossible to compete with local VC-backed companies to grow their team.
Bootstrapped SaaS startups usually have a strong company culture of trust and transparency (https://baremetrics.com/open) and operate with distributed remote teams. Each team member is relatively autonomous and free to choose the way they want to work.
Funded companies can acquire new customers quickly by burning cash to experiment with paid channels. Bootstrapped startups don’t have this luxury. They prefer to rely on the most capital efficient channels: virality and organic inbound marketing. This is great for sustainable growth engine, but there is a down side: it will require a good amount of time and patience to get initial results.
Agorapulse is a Social Media Management SaaS startup, bootstrapped in Paris in 2010. Since our initial launch, we’ve been lightly pressing on the gas pedal with steady sustained growth into profitability (currently at $3M in Annual Recurring Revenue).
We are the typical bootstrapped SaaS startup targeting SMBs, with 2200+ customers handled by a distributed remote team of 25, working out of six countries (France, USA, Ireland, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil).
We’re nimble, we’re lean, and we’re humble — but we think and dream BIG, competing against huge VC-backed companies:
Our main milestones up to today look like this:
Goal: Launch v1.0 MVP (Mininum Viable Product), get real feedback and revenue from first customers, $10K MRR (or 100+ customers)
AgoraPulse v1.0 was launched in september 2011, focused solely on Facebook, with apps/contests support and some initial social media management features.
By the end of 2012, we had validated our MVP and raised $250K seed round to continue to develop our platform and target initial traction.
It took us 18 months to reach $10K MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue). That’s a pretty slow start, but we were entering a crowded market, and a huge feature set was required: an all-in-one solution (not just contests, publishing or monitoring, but all of them under one roof). We built it all with a small tech team of three top-notch engineers.
This is the hardest part of the journey. Based on a ChargeBee study, it takes an average of nine months for SaaS startups to hit $10K MRR, but crossing the desert can take much longer…
From $1 to $10k MRR, you have the illusion of product/market fit.
“In early customer development, you’re not selling. You’re learning” — Alex Turnbull, Groove
Goal: Tune growth engine and reach $100K MRR (or around $1M ARR)
Handling technical debt while growing is another complicated topic. In 2013, we decided to rewrite our entire platform on a modern tech stack (based on Angular and Grails). We also developped an iOS and Android mobile app (based on Ionic) in 2014.
At that time, a high churn rate linked to our initial target audience (time-framed FB contests/campaigns) was killing our growth. So we worked hard to reduce our churn and ARPU metrics, continuously improving our product and integrating additional social networks: Twitter and then Instagram — must haves for any viable social media management platform.
But we were still a small team with limited resources. It took us 30 months to go from $10K to $100K (a total of four years since launch). Recent examples of some of the best time frames are Front, Groove or Buffer who managed to get from $10K to $100K in about 15 months.
This part of the journey can be really rewarding as all the initial efforts start to pay off.
“You’ll fail in SaaS if you don’t commit to spending 24 months to achieve Initial Traction” — Aaron Ross
Goal: Accelerate and reach initial scale at $1M MRR (or around $10M ARR)
Now comes 2017. Things are really getting serious! Currently at $3M ARR, we find ourselved right in the middle of this: From Initial Traction to Initial Scale: The Hardest Phase. But — The Cavalry is Coming.
What’s a good MRR MoM (Month-over-Month) growth rate at this stage?Here is Jason M. Lemkin’s answer:
But that’s for funded startups, most of which aren’t profitable. Honestly, if you’re gaining between 5% to 10% MoM at this stage (more than 100% YoY), as a bootstrapped startup AND you’re profitable, you’re doing a great job.
PROS:
CONS:
Clement Vouillon wrote an interesting article comparing the Metrics of 37 SaaS Companies, with the following conclusion:
“Money doesn’t buy better core metrics but it buys growth speed” — Clement Vouillon, Point Nine Capital
Are you prepared to committing several years to hitting Initial Validation and Traction? Do you fit into the bootstrapped startup model: targeting SMBs, located outside of Silicon Valley, possibly with a strong remote culture?
Then bootstrapping is most probably the way to go. Nobody will prevent you from raising money later on, either from venture investors or from debt credit, in order to transform your buggy into a dragster!
You’ll be in control and you’ll have the choice.
Obviously, off-road racers won’t have the acceleration capability of nitro/VC powered dragsters. They’re made for agility and endurance. They can provide exhilarating freedom and an amazing driving experience. However, the “un-silicon valley way” to build a startup is a much longer ride.
It’s a question of time, patience and perseverance.
“Patience and dedication will see you through. Don’t give up. Do the time and you’ll see” — Aaron Ross
We’ve successfully managed to bootstrap Agorapulse from France and have taken our time to build a “serious” business in a crowded market, competing with heavily VC-backed US startups. Last year, we found ourselves with some sexy and healthy metrics that could be used to raise a Series A round and began to wonder if we should inject some nitro VC-backed fuel.
As I stated in the previous article, accepting VC funding is pretty much like getting married. We’ve spent months investing our time as founders to the “dating phase” processes of choosing and being chosen. We’ve met with diverse group of investors and startup founders, explored every potential avenue.
Our decision? In the end, we’re sticking with organic fuel for all the reasons I’ve stated above. Plus 2016 has been a great year with 140% YoY growth. We are more than profitable (even after doubling the team) and have enough gas in the tank to continue accelerating into 2017 and target initial scale.
It has been a long and hard journey with many bumps on the road. But what an amazing trip!
We are bootstrapped.We are remote.We are free.We are profitable.And still growing…

This is Part 3 of my epic four-part series, taking a deep-dive into SaaS metrics. I’ll be covering KPIs for Growth, Marketing, Sales and Customer Success, and offering formulae, explanations and expert opinions for 50 essential metrics.
Click to read the complete post, or download it as a PDF to save for later.
No matter how “sticky” or “viral” your app becomes, the continued growth of your SaaS business will depend on effective sales processes.
The SaaS metrics collected here will help you determine everything from the efficiency of your sales team through to the validity of your pricing model. Crucially, they’ll also give you much needed insight into your customers, in terms of their expected lifetime, profitability and value.
After all, there’s more to scaling a SaaS business than acquiring customers: you need to acquire the right types of customer.
Annual Contract Value looks at the value of a customer’s contract over a 12-month period.
For example, if a customer committed to a 24-month contract of $60,000, that contract would generate $2,500 in MRR ($60,000/24 months) and $30,000 in ACV ($60,000/2 years).
TCV stands for Total Contract Value, and looks at the value of a customer’s contract over its entire duration.
Returning to the example above, our customer’s 24-month contract of $60,000 has a TCV of $60,000. If, at the end of their contract, that same customer purchased a different product, paying $10,000 for a 6-month period, the TCV of that contract would be $10,000.
Unlike measurements of recurring revenue, both TCV and ACV measure all revenue generated during the chosen timeframe: including one-off payments and charges.
ARPA stands for Average Revenue Per Account, and is used to measure how much revenue is contributed by an “average” account or customer, per month. Changes to ARPA can be helpful for tracking growth and revenue generation on a per unit basis.
It’s helpful to track ARPA seperately for both new customers and existing customers. This makes it easy to compare the characteristics and revenue generation of your customers over time: seeing how they respond to upselling and cross-selling over their lifetime.
ASP stands for Average Selling Price (or Average Sale Price). Where ARPA looks at the average amount of revenue a customer contributes during the course of a month, ASP measures the average initial price that customers pay at the time of sales conversion:
Understanding your ASP is the key to determining the right sales model for your SaaS startup — self-service, transactional or enterprise — as your ASP places a limit on the Customer Acquisition Cost you can justify (more on that below). A high ASP makes high-touch sales strategies viable, and a low ASP forces you towards a self-service model.
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is designed to tell you how much you need to spend to acquire a single new customer.
For most B2B SaaS businesses, the costs of acquiring a new customer are determined by two factors:
Typically, the easiest way to work out the cost of securing a single new customer is to bundle together the total sales and marketing expenditure in a given time period (period t), and divide it by the total number of new customers.
For example, if you spent $5,000 apiece on sales and marketing in a given month, and closed 10 new customers over that same time period, that month’s Customer Acquisition Cost would be $1,000:
Most CAC calculations intentionally exclude the costs and revenue associated with customer success strategies.
Although customer success teams generate (often significant) revenue, through upselling, cross-selling and encouraging renewals, CAC is designed to measure your ability to generate new revenue from sales and marketing expenditure.
Adding customer success into the calculation distorts that measurement, so it’s best to track separately.
If you generate leads from both paid and unpaid channels, it’s important to calculate acquisition cost separately for each.
With 100 “free” customers (generated with a $0 CAC) and 20 customers at $500 CAC, the average CAC is roughly $83. This “blended” CAC is accurate, but in terms of understanding your sales and marketing strategies, pretty useless.
Instead of generating an abstract dollar value, Dave Kellogg recommends an alternative CAC calculation that compares your sales and marketing expenditure in the previous period (S&Mt-1) to the new revenue generated in the current period (New ARRt).
This effectively tells you how much you’re spending to generate a single dollar of new customer revenue:
For example, if you spent a combined total of $10,000 on sales and marketing last month, and generated $12,000 in new revenue this month, that means that for every $1 of new revenue, you had to spend $0.83 to attain it.
Customers will only become profitable when they’ve generated enough revenue to cover their acquisition cost, and it can be extremely helpful to work out how long this “payback period” will be.
The formula for the CAC Payback Period (also referred to as Months to Recover CAC) is straightforward: just divide the cost of acquiring a customer by the monthly revenue they generate, to work out how many months’ revenue it requires to break-even.
For example, with a customer acquisition cost of $2,000, and an average monthly revenue per customer of $150, it’ll take just over a year for each customer to become profitable:
Although your MRR is going towards paying back your acquisition cost, it’s also contributing to the extra costs associated with providing your service (COGS, #11).
By factoring the Gross Margin into our formula, we can calculate a more accurate payback period:
Using the CAC Payback Period example from earlier, and a gross margin of 70%, we now generate a CAC payback period of 19 months: 6 months longer than previously estimated, as a result of the COGS your MRR needs to cover.
LTV (sometimes referred to as CLTV or CLV) stands for Customer Lifetime Value: the total amount of revenue generated by a single customer over the life of their subscription to your SaaS product.
LTV shows you how much each customer is contributing to your revenue, and for how long, and guides how much you should be spending to acquire them (more on that in the next metric). By segmenting LTV by different customer types and buyer personas, you can also hone in on your most valuable customers.
For example, with an Average Revenue Per Account of $200, and a 10% Customer Churn Rate, we’d generate a Lifetime Value of $2,000:
Neither CAC nor LTV mean much in isolation: you can only work out how “good” your CAC is in relation to the revenue those customers generate (LTV).
For example, if your customer’s lifetime value was $2,000, and it cost $1,000 to acquire that customer, that’s an LTV:CAC ratio of 2:1.
It makes sense that your LTV should always be greater than your CAC: few businesses want to lose money on every customer they acquire.
Beyonbd this, past performance suggests that LTV needs to be about 3x CAC for a SaaS business to survive. Best-in-class performers (like Salesforce and Constant Contact) do even better, with multiples closer to 5x.
Your Win Rate is used to provide a simple look at sales efficiency, and the ability of your sales reps to close deals. It looks at the number of deals won, as a percentage of total deals (those won and lost). It can also be calculated using the dollar value of those deals:
Obviously, a high win rate is indicative of an effective sales team and a high lead quality. But in the early days of your SaaS startup, a high win rate isn’t always something to aim for. Instead, it’s likely a sign that you’re coasting along, relying on easy deals instead of pushing into new segments and markets.
When it comes to scaling your sales team, there’s a simple mathematical constraint in operation: sales people need to sell more than they cost.
Instead of monitoring the cost of your sales team in isolation, you can instead measure sales commission as a percentage of Annual Contract Value (ACV), and directly relate sales costs to the revenue they’re involved in generating.
For example, with a sales commission of $500, and an Annual Contract Value of $5,000, sales commission would be 10% of ACV (or 10:1 — roughly the median sales commission:ACV ratio in SaaS).
Sales efficiency is often referred as the “Magic Number” of SaaS, because it offers a clear, simple way to understand the return generated by your growth (in terms of sales and marketing) investments.
For example, if a SaaS company generates $1.25 million in revenue with an 80% Gross Margin, and spends a total $500,000 on sales and marketing, they’d have a sales efficiency of 2.
Sales Efficiency is the inverse of the payback period: the length of time it takes for customers to “pay back” the costs of acquiring them. For a good benchmark to aim for, a magic number of 1 means that sales and marketing expenditure will be recouped by customer revenue in the next four quarters.
Revenue Per Lead allows you work out the average amount of revenue each lead (as opposed to customer) will contribute. By calculating Revenue per Lead on a per-sales-person basis (using only their active leads as a sample), it provides a great insight into the efficiency of your entire sales team (and the types of leads they’re tasked with closing).
I’d recommend calculating Revenue per Lead using cohort analysis: looking at the ACV revenue generated by a particular “batch” of leads (say leads generated in January), as opposed to dividing ACV (a product of closed deals and thus “old” leads) by your current leads.
Many of the metrics we use to assess (and predict) our growth are actually stuck in the past.
In the same way that light from distant stars shows us a picture from millions of years ago, most sales and revenue metrics reflect deals that were created months and years past.
In other words, if you’re trying to use current sales deals to predict future sales, you’re using outdated information, and obsessing over opportunities created by your old sales and marketing strategies, not your current approach.
Lead Velocity Rate (also known as Lead Momentum or Qualified Lead Growth) is a quick and simple way of measuring the month-on-month growth of your lead generation:
For example, if we generated 100 qualified leads last month (t-1), and 110 this month (t), we’d have a lead velocity rate of 10%:

When you’re hustling hard to grow recurring revenue, it’s always discouraging to churn good customers.
And nothing is more frustrating than losing good customers to failed payments, aka involuntary churn.
A poor setup for fighting involuntary churn will cost your business today, and hamstring growth forever. The problem only gets worse, as lost customer value compounds month-over-month-over-month.
The math is pretty simple: for every dollar of MRR lost per month, multiply by 78.
That’s the annual cost in LTV, assuming 12 months of retention and without factoring for growth. Here’s a calculator to estimate the upside of improved retention.
Gaining an additional $100 MRR each month is worth $7,800 after 12 months.
Here’s the silver lining: Because of it’s involuntary nature, this is a solvable problem, and there is no reason to simply accept it as a cost of doing business. At Churn Buster we spend our days making sure no one loses another customer unnecessarily. And while it’s our job to continuously optimize the processes for doing so, there are basic guidelines that every serious business should establish right away.
This stuff is hard to get right, but incredibly valuable (💰 literally). The following guide will help you avoid some mistakes we’ve been seeing.
Here are 11 key considerations when optimizing your process for recovering customers when payments fail:
5 years ago, it was a good idea to give customers a heads up 30 days, 15 days, 3 days before their card expired. You could plug a potential leak before it became an issue.
Today, just check with your payments provider to see if they have partnerships with card issuing companies.
In the case of Stripe (and many others), they have something called “Card Updater.” It communicates with Visa, MasterCard, and others to update cards in your account automatically. It’s not fully implemented worldwide, and it’s already effective for over 70% of cards that look like they’re going to expire.
If you use Stripe, and want to see Card Updater at work…visit this link to see all the card updates happening: https://dashboard.stripe.com/events?type=customer.source.updated
Most card updates will look like this:
Let’s say you are sending pre-dunning emails to warn customers their cards will expire without their prompt attention…
For every 10 customers you email, 7 would have completed a successful payment.
Their cards will be auto-updated, and their recurring billing won’t skip a beat.
How many emails does your support team get about card updates from confused customers? How many customers are getting emails about billing issues, when they could be getting emails about how awesome your product or service is? And how many customers are cancelling because you emailed the wrong point of contact—someone who doesn’t know your software is actually in-use by the team? (This happens surprisingly often.)
The upshot of shutting down pre-dunning:
Most in-house and free/cheap dunning solutions are set up “the easy way.”
The easy way = emails get triggered every time a payment fails. For Stripe users, this would mean triggering emails based on failed payment webhooks.
The problem with this approach is that emails just go out when payments fail, and you have no control over optimizing the recovery process. Retention funnels (driving traffic to a conversion point via email or phone call) can be optimized similarly to acquisition funnels. Build a process, analyze performance, and iterate on the behavior.
For example, as a general best practice, you should wait to email a customer until their card has been retried once or twice.
Around 20% of your charges will clear within the first 5 days simply by retrying the card.
At Churn Buster, we typically hold off emailing customers until 5 days after the initial failed payment.
See the Pre-Dunning section above for why it’s a bad idea to email customers about a payment problem that doesn’t actually exist. The more your company grows, the more critical this will be.
With custom funnels, you’ll also be able to:
When you email customers, you need to link them somewhere to update their card.
This step is one of the most important you can focus on, and we see a lot of sub-optimal setups.
There are a few key features that should be built into your page to ensure awesome performance:
You may think that customers will find a way to update their card if they value your service, but that’s not always the case. Shit happens, people get busy or go on vacation, they leave their job at the company, or if you’re B2B you could be dealing with multiple points of contact who may not see the value/usage of your product.
Company credit cards, manager authorizations, and other internal operations of the customer’s company all find their way into the updating process. Make it easy for them to pay you.
Specifically with Stripe (check with your payment processor on this), when the retry process wraps up a customer can either be marked as unpaid, or canceled.
Depending on your settings, this will happen after a certain number of days (1 to 22 days in Stripe).
After a subscription is marked as unpaid…they won’t automatically reattempt payment of that invoice. So let’s say you have that set to happen on day 10. If the customer updates their card on day 11, you’re screwed. The new card will be stored on-file, but the subscription won’t have an automatic payment attempted.
And here’s the terrible part: When a subscription is marked as unpaid, all future months/years will generate an invoice, but payment won’t be attempted.
So in this scenario, you get a good card on-file, and a customer who showed intent to renew, yet they’ll never pay you again.
This scenario isn’t much better. Let’s take the same schedule, and assume a card update happens on day 11. The new card will be stored, but since there is no subscription anymore, payment won’t be attempted and future renewals won’t occur.
In either of these cases, it will likely look like you saved the customer depending on your reporting tool. But they’ll never pay you again.
You either need to manually ensure all customers who update their cards get a subscription back into an active state. Or you need to write code that handles these scenarios.
Whenever a card is updated, decide how far back you’d like to go for collecting unpaid invoices. Beyond re-activating the subscription, you can also collect for any invoices that went unpaid in that time frame.
Some companies like to collect all unpaid invoices, others only go back 30–60 days. And some prefer to just forgive the balance and move on.
It depends on your specific business model, but make sure you put thought into this, and build the proper solution.
You don’t want customers to be surprised when they get charged $100 18 times when they update their card after an extended-delinquency.
If that’s your preference, that’s fine, but set some expectations with your customers in these cases.
There are various edge cases that can result in revenue churn. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some edge cases we’ve witnessed that you may want to consider, particularly if you are high-growth or at-scale:
For several reasons:
Then, you’ll need visibility into the following:
Having answers to these questions is critical. Otherwise you’re flying blind hoping for the best.
That can work for very early stage companies, but once you’re growing, visibility is critical.
A basic system can be fun to build as a one-time project, but someone is going to need to keep the gears greased.
When you have 5+ figures of revenue at-risk monthly…simple oversights can be VERY costly and take months to discover.
Once you’ve setup your system, you should assign someone to watch for broken links, pages that aren’t responding, deliverability issues, updates in Stripe’s API, etc.
Automated monitoring systems can help here too and take a bit of load off your team…
Personally, we use Slack alerts very heavily to monitor client accounts and get notified of any issues ASAP.
One example you could monitor for that goes beyond basic maintenance is this: Customer tries to update their card on your page, card gets denied, customer doesn’t try another card.
That’s someone showing intent to reactivate, and then being failed by your system.
Reach out to them! Escalate it to customer success! Just don’t let them walk for good.
You should not only be keeping an eye on Stripe’s (or other integrations) API uptime, but also that of your own dunning system.
How fast are your card update pages? Are you notified when they go down? Can you detect who tried to access those pages during the downtime?
When your email delivery provider (we use Postmark and love them) has downtime, or their queues back up…do your emails still get sent out? Do opens and bounces still get tracked?
These are the things your team can’t ignore when you build or update your dunning system.
If you ask Steli from Close.io to give you one tip, it’d likely be, “Follow up ’til you die!!”
And he’s right, too many people give up early whether they’re sending sales emails, or retention emails.
Our brains tell us that the person we’re working with is no longer interested, that they’re mad at us, or that they’re going to tell the world we’re spamming them. But it’s simply not the case.
We see card updates come in at every stage of our process, and we’ve regularly lengthened our process to retain more customers.
Shit happens, people have long to-do lists, they get distracted. And all they often need is a nudge.
Follow. Up. Relentlessly.
Emails are the bread and butter of your recovery process, but don’t underestimate the power of getting on the phone. Particularly with high-value subscribers. You should absolutely be calling them for card updates.
When you do, keep in mind that it’s rare for people to answer the phone from an unknown number these days, so you’ll be leaving a lot of voicemails. You’ll need a process for leaving effective voicemails and following up several times before you speak with a real human. But don’t stress, it’s totally worth it.
Particularly with B2B, these calls are very helpful for people. Remember, these aren’t collections calls (“you owe us $x”), but rather a chance to show stellar customer service and help them get updated on the spot and keep your service running, while you have a minute of their attention.
In our experience these calls are almost always positive, appreciated, and a chance to stay connected with your highest value customers. As a business owner, finding opportunities to stay connected at various points in a customers lifecycle is a gift… don’t ignore it!
This isn’t an exhaustive list of considerations, but it’s a solid baseline. Start iterating on some improvements and you’ll see an uptick in customer retention. Every percent counts.
When you’re beyond $20k MRR, optimizations have a huge impact when considered in terms of LTV impact.

You probably won’t be a success from day 1. Most founders struggle and may even come close to failure (more than once). The good news: there are plenty of examples of companies that had setbacks along the way, but were still a great success. Docusign is one such success story.
Docusign went public in 2018 with $381mm of total revenue and 350,000 total customers. While Docusign is a success, it wasn’t a straight line. Below is a graphic taken from Docusign’s public filings which shows what I’m talking about.
A few things stand out.
Docusign muddled along for years. Founded in 2003, the graph shows that by 2010 the Company had what looks like less than $10mm of revenue by that 7th year. Furthermore there was almost no growth in revenue from 2010 to 2011. The real growth didn’t actually start until 2013 when pivotal events were partnerships with Google and Oracle. That’s a full 10 years after founding.
The exit took 15 years. That’s well beyond the expectation of any angel investor and probably not what the founders had in mind. A successful exit was ultimately achieved, but the timeline was probably longer than anyone expected.
They burned through $650mm. That’s an extraordinary amount of capital for a software business. For comparison, we find that the median amount of equity and debt publicly traded SaaS companies have gone through before going public is well under $200mm.
Docusign was still not profitable. Operating loss in 2016 and 2017 was $119mm and $116mm respectively. Free cash flow was -$96mm and -$48mm in those years respectively.
Docusign went through a few CEO’s. The CEO at the time of going public, Daniel Springer, became CEO in 2017. From 2011 to January 2017 the CEO was Keith Krach. It’s unclear who the CEO was prior to 2011. The founder, Thomas Gonser, serves on the board. While it’s not uncommon for the founder to be replaced when a company transitions from startup stage to hundreds of millions of revenue, there are plenty of examples of tech companies where the founder is still the CEO (Salesforce, Snapchat, Facebook, Dropbox, Box, etc) and obviously you don’t change CEO’s unless there is a problem.
The learnings from Docusign are that not all successful startups look successful right away, there may be periods when growth is flat or slow, and the time and capital required may be more than anyone expects. Persevere.

This is Part 1 of my epic four-part series, taking a deep-dive into SaaS metrics. I’ll be covering KPIs for Growth, Marketing, Sales and Customer Success, and offering formulae, explanations and expert opinions for 50 essential metrics.
Click to read the complete post, or download it as a PDF to save for later.
Growth metrics are designed to analyse the “momentum” of your business as a whole: your ability to grow, and keep growing.
Think of them like the heartbeat, blood pressure and temperature of your company: the core indicators that reveal the health of your SaaS business at its most fundamental level.
By combining together elements of sales, marketing and customer success, these metrics provide a clear indication of your overall performance, in a handful of key figures (it’s for that reason they often form a crucial part of any investor’s due diligence).
Getting to grips with these SaaS metrics will help you to:
SaaS businesses are subscription-based, and the recurring nature of this payment model makes it relatively easy to track and forecast revenue, in a way that other business models struggle to do. That’s where MRR comes in: we can work out the amount of predictable revenue generated by our customers each month, known as Monthly Recurring Revenue.
MRR is essential for understanding the growth of your business, and with a good handle on customer acquisition and churn rates (which I’ll cover below), we can even use it to extrapolate to the future, and predict future revenue.
The basic formula for MRR is pretty simple: for any given month (period t), simply sum up the recurring revenue generated by that month’s customers to arrive at your MRR figure.
In the following example, in January we have 2 customers, each paying a monthly subscription of $2,000. In February, we gain an additional customer, and MRR increases as a result:
ARR stands for Annualized Run Rate (I’ve also seen it referred to as Annual Recurring Revenue). In simple terms, it’s the recurring revenue generated by your SaaS business over the course of a year:
Most SaaS businesses generate the majority of their revenue from monthly subscriptions, making MRR the clearest indicator of revenue generation. However some businesses deal primarily in yearly contracts, making ARR an easier and clearer metric to use.
As a subscription-based business, your growth depends on new customer acquisition, and crucially, minimising the loss of your existing customers. Customer churn (often referred to as “Logo Churn”) measures the rate at which your existing customers cancel their subscription to your service.
For example, if we start January with 20 paying customers, but finish the month with only 19, the customer churn rate for January alone was 5%:
It’s important to track both monthly and annual customer churn rates, for one very simple reason: reasonable sounding monthly churn can quickly turn into crippling annual churn.
For example, I’ve seen multiple estimates for a target annual churn of 5–7% — using the formula below, that translates to roughly 0.5% monthly churn, or a loss of 1 customer in every 200.
In contrast, a relatively harmless sounding 5% monthly churn rate translates into a massive 54% churn rate over the course of the year:
This is useful for extrapolating annual churn from a single monthly churn figure, but if you have 12-months of data, you can use that to calculate the year’s exact customer churn figure:
Each month, there’s likely to be a portion of your customer base that is currently unable to churn: typically because they’re still bound by their contract (let’s say you offer a monthly rolling contract with a 3-month minimum committment).
Factoring these people into your churn statistic will actually under-report your real churn rate, so it’s a good idea to exclude these people from your calculations:
Similarly, measuring churn isn’t a goal in its own right: we want to understand the why behind churn, and fix it. By grouping together customers with similar attributes (such as month joined, or the length of time they’ve been a customer), we can create churn cohorts to try and identify the triggers that cause high churn.
Revenue churn (also referred to as “MRR churn rate”) is used to look at the rate at which monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is lost, as a result of lost customers and downgraded subscriptions.
For example, if we generate $5,000 MRR during January, but as a result of our earlier lost customer, only $4,750 during February, that month’s revenue churn is $250, or 5%:
The examples above are pretty simple: 5% customer churn resulted in 5% revenue churn. In reality though, different pricing packages, and additional seats, users and storage, can make churn calculations much more complicated.
For example, imagine we were able to upsell 4 of our current customers to a higher priced package, for an additional $250/month.
Though our customer churn rate stays the same, the month’s revenue churn is actually negative: in spite of losing a customer, our upselling has lead to higher revenue than the previous month:
Bookings records the total value of all new deals obtained over a time period. Crucially (and unlike MRR), Bookings figures make no distinction between up-front and recurring payments.
For example, if a customer purchased a year’s subscription for $24,000, that month’s bookings figure would be $24,000, but the month’s MRR would be $2,000 ($24,000 / 12).
As a general rule, tracking Bookings is a useful way of measuring cashflow, but MRR is more helpful for measuring revenue growth over time.
The MRR Growth Rate is extremely useful for measuring the improvement of your revenue generation over time.
For example, if we generated $1,500 MRR last month, and increased that to $2,000 this month, we’d have an MRR Growth Rate of approximately 33%:
A steady month-on-month MRR Growth Rate is indicative of rapid, exponential growth, as it requires more revenue each and every month to sustain the same growth rate.
MRR Growth Rate is useful, but it can be misleading. True exponential growth is extremely rare, and in the early days of a SaaS startup (when your revenue generation is low in absolute terms), reporting on this figure can conflate true exponential growth with step improvements to your revenue: after all, it’s easy to double your MRR for several months when your starting point is $100.
For most SaaS businesses, it’s more useful to report on the amount of new revenue generated each month, as opposed to the percentage growth rate that revenue represents. This is done by breaking down your MRR figures, and grouping together MRR from different sources:
Using this information, we can then calculate Net New MRR: the additional MRR generated, after we’ve taken into account MRR lost to churn.
For example, if we generated $10,000 in new MRR, and an additional $1,000 in upselling revenue, but lost $2,000 as a result of churn, we’d have a Net New MRR figure of $9,000:
The SaaS Quick Ratio is designed to compare your revenue growth over a particular time period (as shown by New MRR + Expansion MRR) with your revenue shrinkage over the same timeframe (as shown by Churned MRR + Contraction MRR).
Devised by Social Capital founder Mamoon Hamid, it creates a simple ratio of growth to churn, and provides a clear indicator of the health of your revenue growth, and not just its speed.
For example, imagine your revenue is growing by $1,000 per month. We might assume that growth would break down as follows:
But there are all-manner of other ways that growth could be happening:
Though the overall growth rate is the same, the underlying health of these businesses is very, very different. The last company is having to generate $4,000 of new revenue, each and every month, just to keep its head above water.
If you’re looking for something to aim for, analysis of real-world SaaS Quick Ratios showed that successful, fast growing SaaS companies sustain an average Quick Ratio of 3.9.
Burn Rate refers to the rate at which companies use their cash supply over time.
There are two types of Burn Rate metrics commonly used in SaaS:
Burn Rate is particularly important to investors because it provides an indication of when a startup should look to raise its next round of funding. For example, with a Net Burn Rate of $200,000, and $2 million in the bank, the company has 10-months of cash remaining (often referred to as the company’s “cash runway”). If that burn rate increased to $400,000, the runway would be reduced to 5-months.
Some SaaS founders also choose to make the distinction between Base Burn Rate and Growth Burn Rate:
Zero Cash Date (ZCD) is the predicted date your startup runs out of cash, as a result of your current burn rate, and assuming no new revenue generation.
Your ZCD provides an indication of when new funding should be sought, and as your startup becomes cashflow positive and builds up its cash reserves, your ZCD should move further and further into the future.
COGS refers to the Cost of Goods Sold: all of the expenditure associated with serving customers and delivering your solution. For a software-as-a-service business, the most common COGS include:
Working out your COGS is an important part of calculating your Gross Margin: the percentage of your revenue left over after the cost of servicing that revenue (i.e. the costs of delivering the service that generated the revenue) is taken into account.
For example, if a company generated $50,000 of revenue over a particular period, and had to spend $7,000 on hosting and $3,000 on customer support over that same period, their Gross Margin on that revenue would be 80%, or $40,000.
High gross margins are a hallmark of software-as-a-service businesses, and the higher your gross margin, the more revenue you have available to invest back into growth.

It’s true that there has never been a better time to build a niche software product. With virtually no startup capital you can launch a SaaS product and start selling subscriptions — gross profit from Day 1 is completely possible.
I run a SaaS business by myself. The only way to run a software business on your own, unless you are a truly brilliant and prolific developer, is to stitch together various services and avoid wheel reinvention at all costs.
Below is a list of most of the services that I weave together to make Storemapper run. A few of links are affiliate. I chose the services without regard to whether they had an affiliate program but if it really bothers you, no problem, just google them directly.
Also, I’m writing an ebook about this stuff, read to the end to learn more about it.
I have sequenced this roughly in the order that I added them to my app over the course of the first year of operating. Some of them are overkill right out of the gate and only make sense when users or revenue reach certain milestones.
If you’re new to coding there’s a good chance you are building in Ruby on Rails. If you’re on Rails you should use Heroku.
Yes, it’s more expensive than other solutions like Rackspace or Digital Ocean, but for a Rails app the ease of deployment is more than worth it. Storemapper is on track to reach $100k in recurring revenue by the end of the year and my Heroku bill is around $150/month. The beauty of Heroku is that as you scale you will run into performance issues in your code. Heroku gives you an insanely easy solution to this, just scale up your server dynos. Yes, your bill may spike, at one point my hosting tab was over $900 for a month. But, you can always tune your app later and recover those costs. one month of high costs. isn’t going to kill you, but losing a ton of subscribing customers because your app is painfully slow can be a disaster. Use Heroku.
You need somewhere to register your domain and point your DNS. Use DNSimple. It costs a little bit more the default DNS manager you in things like Godaddy or Hover, but it’s worth it, one click solutions to most of the integrations like Heroku, Google Apps and so on.
You need to accept recurring payments. Use Stripe. Seriously don’t even bother looking at anything else. The setup is super easy and developer-friendly. The fees are low and it has a growing ecosystem of services that plug in directly to Stripe to help you manage subscriptions.
To accept credit payments your site needs to be secured with SSL encryption. I was incredibly stupid and accepted my first 10 or so credit cards on unencrypted pages. This is both unsafe for you customers and, I think, illegal. There are a myriad of ways to setup SSL on your site that range from expensive to a pain to expensive and a giant pain.
Then there’s Cloudflare. For $20/month you get SSL. Setup Cloudflare, make a change in DNSimple, turn on SSL. Boom your done. On top of that you get Cloudflare’s amazing CDN which can help take some of the strain of your Heroku servers. Storemapper processes over half a million queries a month and the vast majority don’t even touch our servers.
Your app almost definitely needs to send some emails. A welcome email, password reset, notification when a background job has completed. Use Sendgrid. It takes 5 minutes to setup the Heroku add-on and is free or less than $10/mo to start. When you launch the first version of your app you should just send ugly plain text emails via Sendgrid. Storemapper has quite a few background jobs (CSV processing, geocoding, de-duplication) and all the notification emails from those processes still run via Sendgrid.
At this point you have all the components you need to launch a minimum viable product (MVP). Resist the temptation to build every feature you will only need at scale and get shipping.
Zapier is an amazing solution for automating various tasks. After you have a minimum viable product you should look to Zapier first to solve most of your solutions. Want to start sending a mailing list? Have Zapier automatically add new Stripe customers’ emails to a Mailchimp list. Send a fancier welcome email? Same thing, new Stripe Customers -> email. My process for a lot of basic SaaS infrastructure was 1) don’t build it at first 2) hack it together with Zapier 3) finally build it properly.
If you want to start regularly emailing your users with announcements you should use Mailchimp (Mail… Kimp?). Use Zapier to add customers to a list and then email them.
At this point I don’t use Mailchimp for Storemapper as almost all the mass communication goes through Intercom. Intercom is a bit pricier than other options but it’s super powerful. You can use Intercom to send email or in-app messages that appear while users are actually using your app. You can also trigger all kinds of automated lifecycle emails, drip campaigns and follow-up emails. Super powerful but not worth the setup until your app really gets off the ground.
A lot of people use these. I’ve tried Zendesk, Helpscout and Desk.com and ended up dropping them all. I run support through Intercom and it works fine for now. I’m still just one person. I imagine this would change once you have a real support team. Maybe I’m missing something.
If all or most of your payments are running through Stripe at some point you’ll want to dig into the metrics on what’s happening with those payments. What is your monthly recurring revenue, churn rate, lifetime value. What pricing plan contribute the most to your revenue. Barometric is a one-click install, slurps up all your Stripe data and gives you all those metrics with an impressive voilá.
An astonishing amount of your credit card transactions each month will fail. Out of the box Stripe doesn’t have a great solution for this. Stripe can send “failed payment” web hooks back to your app and you can build a little system to bug your customers to update their payment info. This is what I did at first but it still turns out to be a huge hassle to keep track of what customers have and haven’t updated their info and how many payments have failed. Stunning plugs into your Stripe account and let’s you set up automated notifications to customers to hassle them with increasing intensity. As a bonus you can also send pretty payment receipt emails with it.
It’s probably going to be free and at the very least half-decent. If that sounds interesting to you sign up to hear first when it goes live.
Thanks!

Scaling a software company from founding to IPO is no easy feat, and if the business raises equity capital, it’s quite dilutive for founders and employees. I benchmarked a group of ~60 SaaS/cloud/software IPOs and looked at a few things — if at IPO the founder or co-founder was still the CEO, equity ownership pre-and post-IPO, age of CEO, and compensation.
Note that in many cases founders/CEOs sell part of their ownership stake prior to going public in secondary offerings during the fundraising lifecycle, or during the IPO, so the post-IPO equity stakes represented below are on average lower than if they had just been diluted down by more new equity. Many have sold into the IPO too among this group. Moreover, founders and employees experience additional dilution from option pool expansion.
Firstly, of this group of companies, in 36 out of the 61 companies (59%) the original founder or co-founder was still the CEO at IPO. The other 25 (41%) had a non-founder CEO at the time of IPO. This comparable set includes the following companies:
Alteryx, Adaptive Insights, AppDynamics, AppFolio, Appian, Apptio, Atlassian, Avalara, BlackLine, Box, Carbon Black, Cloudera, Cornerstone OnDemand, Coupa, Cvent, Demandware, DocuSign, Domo, Dropbox, Five9, Eloqua, ExactTarget, Fleetmatics, HubSpot, Instructure, LogMeIn, Marketo, MINDBODY, MongoDB, MuleSoft, NetSuite, New Relic, Okta, OPOWER, Paycom, Paylocity, Pivotal, Pluralsight, Q2, SuccessFactors, Rally, Responsys, RingCentral, Salesforce, SendGrid, ServiceNow, Shopify, Smartsheet, Splunk, Tableau, Talend, Tenable, Twilio, Veeva, Wix, Workday, Workiva, Yext, Zendesk, Zscaler, and Zuora.
Founder vs Non-Founder CEO at IPO (Total of 61 Companies)
Now take a look at post-IPO equity ownership for the CEOs of this group. After the IPO, the median ownership for a CEO is 6%. The blue bars indicate founders that were still the CEO at IPO, and the red bars indicate CEOs that were *not* founders at IPO. Not surprisingly, on average founders that are still CEOs at IPO have almost 3.5x more equity (after the IPO) than CEOs that were not founders. The output below has each company’s CEO equity ownership stake post-IPO.
CEO Percentage Ownership Post-IPO
Taking a closer look, below is an output of only founder CEOs (from blue bars above). The median ownership is ~12% after the IPO.
Founder CEO Percentage Ownership Post-IPO
Now below is an output that just shows non-founder CEO ownership (the red bars from first chart), and as expected, their respective post-IPO equity ownership is much lower than founder CEOs. The median here is ~5%.
Non-Founder CEO Percentage Ownership Post-IPO
Given IPOs are another form of fundraising, CEOs take additional dilution during the IPO and in some cases, sell into the IPO. Below is an output of both pre and post-offering ownership medians and averages, as well as the implied IPO dilution. This includes all 61 companies.
Pre and Post-IPO CEO Equity Ownership Averages / Medians
How old are CEOs when their companies IPO? The median age for a CEO is 46 years old at the IPO quarter. Founders CEOs are also younger than non-founder CEOs when their company goes public; founder CEOs were 44 and non-founder CEOs were 51, both on a median basis. Additionally, for non-founder CEOs, they’re on average the CEO for 5 years before the IPO.
CEO Age at IPO
With regard to compensation, the numbers vary significantly but below is an output with both annual salary, equity, non-equity and other comp, and total compensation in the IPO year. It’s worth calling out that 3 CEOs did not have a salary or it was at $1/year; Joshua Coates at Instructure, Marc Benioff at Salesforce, and Jay Choudary at Zscaler. Two out of the 61 companies had co-CEOs (Atlassian and Workday). Dan Springer also shows up twice on the list as the CEO of DocuSign and Responsys. The output below shows medians and averages.
Annual CEO Compensation in IPO Year
No two software companies follow the same path from founding → IPO, and there is significant variation within this group of 61 companies. It’s also a moving target as 10+ were added to the comparable set this year alone. With that said, this should shed some light on what a CEO could expect to own by the time his or her company goes public, which is ~12% for founder CEOs and ~5% for non-founder CEOs. Raising equity capital is expensive and most companies need to sell a large portion of their businesses to reach IPO scale but can create significant value by doing so — Salesforce — the largest company in the comparable set, has a market cap of almost $115 billion at the time of this post. It had a market cap of $1.1B at IPO almost 15 years ago.

Building the modern analytics engineering workflow. Founder & CEO @ dbt Labs, builders of dbt.
More posts by Tristan Handy.
Business intelligence tech has changed really dramatically over the past 3–4 years since the advent of cloud-based analytic databases like Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, and Google BigQuery. These databases are so powerful that they fundamentally shifted the way that the surrounding components of the analytics tech stack needed to be built. As a result, a completely new BI tech stack has emerged. Like the cloud databases that this it is built on top of, this stack is far more powerful, more usable, and less expensive than what it’s replacing.
The new BI stack typically involves the following components:
Below I’ll walk through the decisions you need to make and steps you need to take to get up and running with your tech stack.
I’m using the term “database” here, but you could alternately use the term “data warehouse”. If you want to get geeky, you’d say “MPP analytic database” but that’s a bit of a mouthful. Exactly what an MPP analytic database is and how it’s different from a traditional RDBMS is a fascinating topic but one that I’ll have to leave for another post. For now, suffice it to say that analytic databases are a class of databases that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional relational databases at executing analytic queries over very large datasets.
Realistically, as of this writing, you’re talking about one of a small number of products: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake. All three are great products, and in many cases each will serve you equally well. There are times when one will treat you better than others. If you have massive data volumes of things that look like events (typically user activity or machine-generated data), BigQuery will often be your best bet. If you have a more relational structure and a large number of users, Snowflake really shines. If you’re just getting started and feel like your use case is pretty typical, it’s hard to go wrong with Redshift.
If you are not an engineer, you should pull one in to help you make this decision. The tradeoffs are purely technical at this point, and require an understanding of the underlying technologies in question.
Next, you need to figure out how to get your data into your data warehouse. There are a couple things you need to know here:
There are a large number of good tools available today to ETL your raw data into your data warehouse that are lightweight, do minimal transformations, and don’t require you to write any code at all. We use either Stitch or Fivetran (or both) with our clients and are huge fans of both products. Which one you use ends up being more about which one supports the specific integrations you need and which will end up costing you less. Each one has a free trial: spin up both and see which one suits your needs better.
You obviously need a BI tool. It should be a web-based product that connects to your warehouse, runs queries, builds charts, and lets you share them. There more options here than would be interesting to read as a part of this, but I’ll highlight ourfavorite two. If your primary users will be analysts, use Mode Analytics. If you will have both analysts and business users building reports, use Looker. To read more about our thoughts on this space and how we choose what to use with our clients, read this.
If you’ve never worked with any of the cloud-based BI tools on the market, don’t sweat it too much. Try a bunch. Choose what you like. As long as the raw data is in a data warehouse that you own, you can always throw out your BI tool and buy a new one.
This is the critical step that most people miss when constructing their BI stack. Remember when I said earlier that it wasn’t a good idea to transform data prior to loading it into your data warehouse? Well, that doesn’t mean it isn’t a good idea to transform your data, it’s just that your data warehouse is now so fast that it’s better to load your data in first, and then use your warehouse to transform it. This is sometimes known as the “ELT” approach.
There are a large number of reasons why you might want to transform your data, but they all boil down to this: it’s a good idea to apply a certain amount of business logic to your data before users get their hands on it. Remove erroneous records. Fix data anomalies. Translate old business rules into new ones. Generally apply business logic that will make it easier and more consistent to analyze data once an analyst actually sits down to their keyboard.
Here’s an example: if you do a meaningful amount of advertising, you’ll likely have data piping into your warehouse from Adwords, Facebook Ads, Bing, and more. Many companies run ad campaigns with 10 or more different ad channels. That data will originally be piped into your warehouse in a bunch of different schemas. In the modeling stage, you’ll want to create a single table where you can union together ad performance from all of your different channels so that you can report on it together.
Modeling your data has several big advantages:
My company, Fishtown Analytics, uses and maintains an open source tool called dbt (data build tool) that helps analysts and engineers model data inside their warehouses. dbt today has over 100 active companies using it, including teams from Casper, Seatgeek, and Wistia. We’d love to have you in our ever-growing Slack community!
Here’s what the modern BI stack looks like when you put it all together:
Pros who have done BI work in the past expect it to take months to configure this type of tech stack, but with modern SaaS-based tools you can configure the entire stack in a day or less. Which means you can get to work doing real work that much sooner.
Of course, there are plenty of nuances involved in this process, and that’s one of the main reasons why companies frequently pull us in to help us work through it. If you’re interested in learning more about how this tech works and in helping get you off the ground, get in touch. I’d love to chat.

We spoke to an investment banker yesterday about his view of the SaaS market. Some of the learnings he shared where surprising, and a departure from what most bankers and investors will tell you. Because the conversation was so candid and not a glowing view of SaaS, he’ll remain anonymous for purposes of this article, but we believe his views should definitely be taken seriously.

The software industry has come a long way since 1999 when Marc Benioff decided to build a contact management app called Salesforce.com and offer it as a web application. This simple idea changed the software landscape and created a wave of innovation unlike anything we have seen before in enterprise software. By moving applications to the cloud we democratized enterprise software and made it broadly available to organizations of all sizes. Today, even the smallest companies have access to the same powerful tools that 10 years ago were only available to the largest of enterprises.
But the SaaS software market has become very crowded. Just take a look at some of the various landscapes published here and here and your head will start spinning. There are numerous excellent venture-backed companies in every software category. Many are great companies that are here to stay.
The general consensus is that at some point the SaaS ecosystem will begin to consolidate. And yet, we have seen very little evidence that this is happening. Software M&A has been very tame over the past few years. Part of the reason may be the high valuations in the private markets. Part of the reason may be that the acquirers have become rather concentrated themselves. And part of it may be that something fundamental has changed, which is my belief and the premise of this post.
Over the past decade prior to joining August Capital, I held leadership roles at many exciting SaaS (and traditional) companies, including Salesforce, Box, Lifelock, and HP. In my role, I was primarily responsible for driving strategy and finding new opportunities for growth, which naturally leads to inorganic initiatives (acquisitions and investments). I was responsible for more than 25 acquisitions, which allowed me to experience first hand the unique challenges of making SaaS deals successful.
The Golden Days of Software M&A
In the early/mid 2000s, the large software vendors and private equity firms undertook a massive consolidation of the software industry. The driver behind this for the strategic buyers was the ability to achieve large revenue synergies through their distribution reach. Whether you are selling an appliance or a software application, the extensive distribution capabilities of the large software vendors allowed them to create a lot of value by acquiring applications and pushing them through their channel (direct sales, partners, distributors, integrators, VARs, etc.). The on-premise, perpetual license business model also afforded buyers the opportunity to materially cut costs. For example, I doubt Oracle invested a dime of R&D into PeopleSoft after the acquisition.
Another reason this strategy worked in the on-premise world is that customer success was the responsibility of the customer, not the vendor. If you wanted to buy an ERP system, you would purchase a license from the vendor and then work with a systems integrator (companies like CSC or Accenture) to customize the application to your needs, integrate it, deploy it, and help you manage it. And if you failed…well, that would not be the vendor’s fault!
The Challenge with SaaS
The challenge with SaaS is that it is a lot more complex and difficult to create value with acquisitions. The on-premise playbook does not work in the SaaS world and scaling a SaaS application has proven difficult. The key challenges every acquirer grapples with include:
What is Next?
It is my view that the tepid M&A environment will continue for the foreseeable future. I do not believe large software vendors will embark on ambitious consolidation strategies. The IPO markets will continue to be the path to liquidity for the select few companies that are able to build escape velocity to reach $100 million in revenue, focusing on large addressable markets, and are still growing >40%. SaaS vendors with $20–100 million in revenue, growing +/- 30% will never reach the IPO milestone. Nor are those companies getting acquired. They will have to become profitable and create value for their investors in the absence of a liquidity event.
We will continue to see tactical small acquisitions intended to fill product gaps, bring key technology capabilities and talent to larger organizations. On the other extreme, I believe we will see some of the larger SaaS vendors be acquired in the coming years. This strategy makes sense because if you have to do the hard work described above, you should at least make it worthwhile and impactful. SAP has adopted this strategy and has concentrated their efforts on few large acquisitions (SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur). Is Marketo next?
The lack of liquidity in venture SaaS portfolios is probably just starting to raise concerns. It will be interesting to watch how the venture community responds to this new reality. I doubt early stage venture investors will change how they evaluate investment opportunities, but the calculus for growth investors may have to change.

https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-to-manage-saas-subscription-billing-using-servicebot-open-source-4901301dfbe8?source=search_post---------350,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
In this article I will explain how to use Servicebot, a platform for automating SaaS billing. Servicebot is designed to be the billing engine enabling businesses to sell software as a service.
Being able to manage the subscription lifecycle is paramount to selling a SaaS. This means having automated processes which react to specific billing events, such as subscribing or cancelling a service. Typically, subscription billing is made up of the following events:
The ability to set an application to react to these events (for example, restricting access if a free trial expires without a payment source), is the core to billing management for SaaS.
Servicebot is designed with this in mind and gives a company the ability to add business logic around these events.
Servicebot powers SaaS billing with two main constructs. The Service Template, containing the details of what customers are subscribing to, and the Service Instance, which represents the service a customer has subscribed to.
The Service Template is the blueprint needed to deliver an application to a customer. The template contains details such as the pricing and field definitions the end customer needs to fill out. For example, a business may want to collect a phone number or other information when on-boarding new customers. Their service template would contain a required input field that needs to be filled out in order to create a new service instance.
Once a customer subscribes, a service instance is created based on the service template and the information they filled out. For SaaS billing, hooking into the lifecycle of the service instance is key. Instances can be upgraded, cancelled, or trialing — meaning all a company needs to do to implement billing is integrate their application with the different events that occur within Servicebot.
Here are some of the important features that make service instances a great fit for SaaS:
Servicebot makes it easy for you to embed forms to your website. Just copy and paste the code into your site and immediately start selling your product. All you need to do is specify what happens after a customer presses “subscribe.”
The other embeddable which Servicebot provides is an account management form. When you embed this in your SaaS, your customers can add their credit card, change their plan to a higher tier, cancel their subscription, or resubscribe. You just have to paste pre-generated code into your application and Servicebot takes care of the rest.
One of the best ways to alert your app to billing changes, such as a trial expiring, is with webhooks. Webhooks allow apps to communicate real-time information to other apps. In this case, Servicebot would be providing your SaaS with billing information.
Using Servicebot, webhook endpoints can be defined so whenever a billing event occurs, the endpoint will be notified and action can be taken. For example: if a trial expires, a webhook will be sent to the SaaS and the customer can be locked out of the software until they pay.
We at Servicebot believe that the process of getting paid for your software should not be a difficult task. Many tools focus on the payment aspect of billing; Servicebot is different by focusing on the service being provided, making it much easier to tap into the subscription lifecycle.

https://saasholic.com/t2d3-the-climb-a-escalada-de-uma-startup-saas-ba75fdf98b3a?source=search_post---------371,"Na última semana publiquei um post que despertou um interesse bacana de outros empreendedores do mercado SaaS, onde compartilhei alguns do materiais que nos ajudaram muito nos primeiros anos da Rock Content. Por isso, hoje, resolvi trazer outros 2 “ouros” para quem está nesta indústria. Here we go:
Como construir uma Startup avaliada em $1 bilhão de dólares, no mercado SaaS?
Essa é a pergunta que o investidor Neeraj Agrawal, da Battery Ventures, tentou responder analisando a performance de grandes empresas SaaS de capital aberto dos EUA. Ele compartilhou seus aprendizados em um artigo fantástico no Techcrunch no início de 2015. A resposta, para ele, era um benchmark chamado de Triple, Triple, Double, Double, Double… Ou carinhosamente, o T2D3.
Se você ainda está começando uma startup SaaS, ou já tem alguma tração e nunca ouviu essa expressão, é bom ler este post até o final. Esse modelo impactou todo o mercado de forma dramática e se tornou leitura obrigatória para quem quer construir uma grande empresa. Pense o seguinte: Se você não ler este artigo, seus investidores, potenciais investidores e concorrentes estarão lendo. GO GO GO!
Antes de explicar o que é o T2D3, veja o gráfico abaixo:
Sim, essa é a velocidade, em anos que 7 empresas SaaS de capital aberto demoraram para chegar aos U$100 milhões de receitas anuais recorrentes (ARR). Insano, não? Esse gráfico nos mostra que hoje, as melhores empresas SaaS levam cerca de 5 anos para sair de apenas alguns milhões de dólares em faturamento para atingir os U$100m de ARR.
O plano para chegar a mais de U$100 milhões de dólares em receitas anuais recorrentes passa por 7 fases (Não se assuste, ok?):
Esta etapa não tem uma duração definida, mas o objetivo é simples. Criar um produto que resolva grandes dores do cliente potencial. Conhecer as necessidades do cliente e chegar a uma solução escalável e provada é o primeiro objetivo no T2D3. O passo 1 é chegar ao Product/Market Fit.
Nesta fase a empresa ainda não tem um time escalável de vendas e muitas vezes os próprios fundadores atuam vendendo. A maioria das empresas leva entre 1 e 2 anos para atingir este patamar. Nesse momento, a empresa começa a entender eu funil de vendas, mas a velocidade ainda é tímida.
Sair de U$2m em ARR para U$6m em ARR não é nada fácil. Existem 2 caminhos principais. No primeiro o fundador continua envolvido nas vendas e fecha a maior parte das novas receitas. Já no segundo, a empresa começa a montar uma máquina de vendas, contratando os primeiros vendedores (5 a 10) e busca escalar a aquisição com profissionais ainda não tão experientes.
É aqui que a empresa começa a passar a sensação de que o foguete vai decolar. A marca da empresa já é um pouco mais conhecida, clientes recomendam os produtos e serviços e as renovações de contrato também aumentam o faturamento do negócio. Nesse momento o time de vendas cresce aceleradamente e a todos os meses novos vendedores estão entrando. Ao final desta etapa já começam a surgir os primeiros gestores time de vendas e os fundadores já não estão mais envolvidos tão de perto nas vendas.
Triplicar se tornou praticamente impossível, mas crescer se tornou inevitável. Os times de vendas já passam de 20 pessoas e tem múltiplos gerentes. Expansões internacionais começam a ser discutidas dentro da empresa e os playbooks de vendas estão amadurecendo rápido. Grandes clientes já conhecem a empresa e confiam em seus produtos e serviços.
O time de vendas se tornou grande e especializado. Nesse momento a empresa começa a considerar uma estrutura de canais e revendas para acelerar o crescimento. A atuação internacional da empresa já é uma realidade.
Nesse patamar de faturamento o IPO da empresa se aproxima e os investidores já começam a considerá-la um unicórnio. Os funcionários que entraram no início e receberam opções de ações estão se preparando para comprar suas mansões e suas Ferraris. Ainda existe muito valor para ser criado após o IPO, mas a empresa está consolidada no seleto clube dos U$100m de ARR.
O fato é que a Salesforce, a maior empresa SaaS do mundo (veja um resumo da história dela aqui), já está faturando U$7bi em ARR. É isso mesmo, meu amigo, os U$100m e o T2D3 acabaram de ficar pequenos.
Tien Tzuo é fundador e CEO da Zuora, além de ter sido o primeiro CMO da Salesforce. O cara manja um pouquinho de SaaS, não é? Pois é. Ele resolveu aprofundar-se ainda mais nesse o assunto, pois ele é obcecado por seguir os passos da sua Alma Mater rumo aos bilhões de ARR. No blog da sua empresa, ele descreveu a chamada “The Climb”. A The Climb é descreve a subida para não só passar dos U$100m de ARR, mas também para alcançar o patamar de U$1bi em ARR (#SalesForceFeelings).
O modelo tem várias similaridades com o T2D3, por isso, hoje vou descrever brevemente os primeiros passos e entrar um pouco maisa fundo nos últimos apenas, ok?
As fases do The Climb são:
As primeiras etapas, especialmente até os primeiros U$30m em ARR são bem parecidas com o modelo T2D3, por isso não vou esticar demais por aqui. Quem quiser se aprofundar, leia o artigo todo aqui.
Vamos então detalhar um pouco mais as duas últimas fases :
Se você está indo no modelo T2D3, você já sabe que agora só tem que dobrar mais 2 vezes… (Fácil, não?).
Depois dos U$30m de ARR, você já provou sua ideia, seu produto, sabe que seu mercado é grande e que seu modelo de negócios funciona. Porém algo interessante ocorre: A medida que a sua startup SaaS chega perto dos U$100 milhões de ARR, um ecossistema começa a se formar ao seu redor. Fornecedores, investidores e banqueiros querem que você faça um IPO e siga crescendo. Todo mundo quer estar perto de você…
100m de ARR? Você já é um unicórnio. Talvez já tenha até aberto o capital num IPO bem sucedido. Nesse momento o foco da sua empresa SaaS se volta para se tornar uma verdadeira plataforma de negócios. Empresas como a Salesforce, Microsoft e a Oracle se tornaram grandes plataformas de negócios e esse precisa ser seu próximo passo. Com U$100m, você já tem a tração necessária e todas as empresas menores que gravitam ao seu redor querem vender para seus clientes e fechar parcerias com você. Chegou a hora de criar um ecossistema, uma nova indústria, onde você é o líder indiscutível. Quando sua empresa atinge os U$300m de ARR, você chegou lá. Nesse momento, fica claro para o mercado que você será capaz de chegar a U$1bi de ARR e que isso é inevitável. Tien conta que quando a Salesforce fez seu IPO, as pessoas acreditavam que o mercado de CRM era um mercado cujo tamanho total era de U$1bi. Porém, quando a SF lançou suas plataformas de aplicativos (Force.com & AppExchange) ficou claro para o mundo que a empresa estaria em breve a U$1bi de ARR. E o resto é história…
T2D3. The Climb. É óbvio que estes são modelos desafiadores e que eles não são para qualquer um. Se você olhar para o mercado de empresas SaaS de capital aberto do mundo, você vai ver que os benchmarks são possíveis, mas obviamente improváveis.
A ideia destes modelos é que usando-os, você consiga quebrar seu crescimento em pequenas fases bem mapeadas e assim executar melhor, com clareza, mas mantendo o objetivo de longo prazo dentro do seu campo de visão. Na Rock, estes modelos nos ajudam muito a nos comparar com o mercado, planejar nosso crescimento e até mesmo nossas necessidades de capital. Nem sempre dá para triplicar, mas crescer 2,5X em um ano é quase tão legal quanto, não é mesmo? Sonhar grande custa o mesmo que sonhar pequeno.

A lot of entrepreneurs/founders don’t start out as a ‘finance guy/gal’. Nevertheless as founders, the company’s financial future is in our hands. To do the job right we need to build and maintain an operating model that explains how the company will grow (and spend). Until we have the budget and capacity to make that finance hire who is a finance expert, this responsibility is on our shoulders. But at any stage it remains imperative that you as the CEO understand and remain deeply connected to the company’s financial profile.
My first operating model took a long time to create, it was functional but not particularly well informed. It didn’t go far enough to tell the story of why growth would happen in a particular way. Over the years the model improved as I gained experience and help from investors and my finance team. This year, when we set out to create our 5th iteration of the financial model, we decided to do so in a way that would enable other founders of early stage companies to create a robust model with considerably less effort. With this post I share a template operating model and some of the experiences that inform its logic. The model is most applicable to VC-backed SaaS companies. Adapt it as needed.
As first-time founder and CEO my relationship with an operating model has gone through many iterations. Early advice I got after spending time building out my first model was, “All you need is an idea to raise money. You’re wasting time on the model because it’s going to be wrong anyway.” Part of that statement is true, but it was terrible advice.
My first operating model was indeed wrong, but it’s a critical first step to really owning the financial future of the company. I found building a financial model from scratch helped me understand the mechanics of growth that were particular to my business. For example, we had to go through a year-long audit process with an industry regulator that cost us time and money before we could start selling to our target audience. Showing these costs in the model helped my early investors see that I had a point of view and was planning for this stuff. But there were some fundamentals that were missing, such as the relationship between investing in sales and marketing and revenue growth.
You might be using Quickbooks or Xero or other accounting software. The model is not intended to replace these. Both the accounting software and the operating model play an important role in managing your business. You’ll want to keep BOTH up-to-date as part of your monthly financial close process.
A model will help you answer questions, model different financing scenarios and generally understand your business more clearly.
How much money should I raise? The amount of capital raised matters. Raise too much too soon and dilute yourself unnecessarily. Raise too little and you run the risk of running out of money. So you must take time to consider how long it will take your team to reach the milestones you want to reach before going out for the next funding round. Let’s say you’re considering a seed round and want you want to get to $2m run rate before you raise your Series A. You must figure out how much you’re going to spend before you reach that milestone and raise enough to get you there with some cushion. It nearly always will take longer and be more expensive than you’re able to anticipate.
Should I be conservative or aggressive? You’re going to need to show up to different conversations with different points of view and a flexible model will help you understand what levers you can pull to grow faster or slow down your burn rate. Investors will likely trim your revenue projections by 20%–40% when considering an investment. As a result, when selling the idea many founders like to be more aggressive when showing how the company could grow. But once you’re working with a board and using your model to set company goals and quotas for your sales team, you’ve got to think carefully about what you’re committing to. The model alone won’t determine how many activities each sales person can do in a day and how many sales are actually achievable each month. One of my favorite sales leaders Loren Padelford of Shopify has a great talk on this part of building sales models with Bowery Capital.
How fast will we be able to grow? If you’re raising a Seed round your primary mission is to quickly find product-market-fit for and then scale. If you’re raising a Series A you’ve already found product-market-fit and you’re focusing more on building the organization in preparation for the growth ahead. After product-market-fit is established, how fast you are able to grow depends a lot on how much capital you have available. A model like the one we’ve shared here will help you understand some of the key relationships between growth and costs.
Who do I need to hire and when? One of the most important parts of the operating model is the hiring plan. Personnel will likely be the largest part of your operating expense. Being thoughtful about the WHEN and WHY of hiring is critical for controlling your burn rate and planning your company’s growth. A good model will help you understand if your ideas about who to hire and when make sense and will help you explain your thinking to your prospective investors and/or your board.
I decided to create an open source template so that other founders can benefit from the work that we’ve done. In this project, I have tried to thread the needle between robust and not too complicated or specific. It has been tested by several investors and MBA interns and has proven to work well. But it is up to you to adapt it for your own needs.
To get started, click here and make a copy of the model.

Have fun and happy modeling!

Graphing:
I don’t use the built in google graphs for my charting needs. I use the web app created by Mike Preuss at Visible.vc. The model shared here makes graphing on Visible (or any other graphing platform that integrates with Google Sheets) easy enough and you can get a much better result.

Part of my job when I invest in a start-up is to get folks excited about the company. It’s not that hard. Because I am genuinely excited. Or I wouldn’t make the investment. And part of the picture I try to paint for the The Next Investor is where they’ll be in 12–18 months.
E.g., “Well, RainforestQA is at $5m ARR and has grown 14.20309% a month for the past 5 months and is completely changing the way a $50 billion market does …” [numbers not actual, just for the sample anecdote].
If the growth is there, the company is solid, the market good, and the CEO credible and strong, then usually, there’s just one point of pushback I get.
“It will never last. There’s no chance they can keep it up.”
OK, I say. Agreed. But what’s going to stop company X from continuing to grow at outlier rates?
“You’ll see,” they say. “I have so many companies in my portfolio that totally stalled out at $20m ARR”.
After hearing it about 15–20 times from many of the most successful SaaS VCs, I decided to do a bit of an analysis here. I don’t have all the data. But I’ve now looked into almost a dozen SaaS companies that stalled out somewhere in the $20m-$40m ARR range. And I’ve found an obvious pattern.
It’s not market size. The best founders always find a way to grow their deal size, their market, their segment. Almost always.
It’s not competition. Yes, they can slow you down. But if you are the #1 or #2 by market share, competition can slow you, but it doesn’t stall you out. More on that here.
It’s not leads and sales and marketing. Sometimes it is, yes. But once you have a brand, one way or another, the leads come. Not enough. But they do come. And the sales team, even if they are imperfect, gets pretty good at selling a product after they’ve been doing it for a while.
Turns out it’s always the same root cause.
The ones that stall out at $20m ARR, or thereafter? They all aren’t beloved products. They all have low NPS. They all have brands, yes. But the customers are really only behaviorally loyal — see more on this critical point here. The customers use the product because they have to. Not because they love to. It’s what we use for sales automation of a certain process. Or marketing automation of a certain process, they say. We use it. But. It goes down all the time. But. It’s really dated. But. No one ever gets back to our calls. But. It doesn’t have core competitive features. But. No one ever comes and visits us and truly solves our problems.
Because what happens is, just as you finally go from Mini-Brand to Real Brand, you start to get into every deal. That’s when it actually gets easier on many levels, usually around $10m ARR or so, whenever you have a true brand (more that here). Then every prospect has heard of you. They all at least want to kick the tires.
And if your customers love you — magic happens. This is when Second Order Revenue reallykicks in. They actively recommend you to their colleagues, and their peers at other companies. Importantly, they buy more stuff from you, too. More seats. More editions. More of everything. Look at Alex Wilhelm’s tweet on Box’s financials above. I don’t know what Box’s NPS and CSAT scores are. But I do know they are high. Otherwise, there’s no way they could generate 40% of their growth from their existing base. And if Box (and its CEO) weren’t loved, they’d be growing 15–21% a year. Not 37%. That’s a huge, huge difference my friends. More on second order revenuehere.
OK, so what’s actionable here?
A few things:
The reality is, there is too much to do in every start-up. One of the corners some of us cut is customer satisfaction. It’s not that we don’t care. But, we de-prioritize customer success. We don’t measure NPS. And often, we sort of live with the complaints, as part of reality. There’s only so much we can do, and we have to pick our battles.
Well, if your NPS is 0 or 10 or 20. Then. You’ll stall out. And you’ll stall out once you have a real brand, and it’s just getting good. Because churn will be higher than average. And upsell will be lower. Best case, you’ll grow 30–40% slower than you otherwise would. And that’s with a great sales & marketing team. Worst case, you’ll never really truly benefit from net negative churn.
You’re gonna tell me no one in your industry has high NPS and CSAT.
Well — Poppycock. I have investments in both legal and HR spaces (notorious for low NPS) both with NPS scores across all customers in excess of 60.
More importantly, whatever your NPS and Customer Satisfaction is — you can drive it up. You can. I guarantee it. Make it Job 1 and amazing things will happen. And importantly, this is the one thing everyone in the company can help with. Support, engineering, product, sales, success, marketing, everyone. Everyone knows how to make customers happier. Everyone.
Yes, you can shove stuff through the channel. Yes, great sales teams can close crazy well, and mask issues for a while. Yes, venture capital can help smooth out the bumps here.
But, once you have something, don’t let your customers say they are only using you because it’s the best solution they could find. Or the one they are used to.
You have to be the one they love.

Some late night rambling…
SaaS companies are service ecosystems. By “service” I am not talking about professional services (though SaaS companies can certainly offer these). I’m talking about service as:
the production of an essentially intangible benefit … which through some form of exchange, satisfies an identified need (source)
Imagine a restaurant with robot chefs and waiters. Your code is basically scripted service design and delivery. You can pay an accountant for tax “services”. Or you can pay Intuit for tax “services”. Intuit uses code (as well as humans) to orchestrate the service delivery.
When we “ship a feature” we are adding some sort of service delivery capability. It is only valuable when it “satisfies an identified need”. The code itself is like a recipe for robot chefs. If the food sucks, or people don’t eat the food, the recipe is not valuable. There needs to be an exchange. Yes people buy on the items on the menu, but they renew on the quality of the exchange.
Robots? Sure. Consider the increasing use of AI and machine learning in B2B SaaS products. Often we refer to SaaS products as “tools”. Consider that we perceive of these products as tools because we (the user) USE the tool. It feels like a hammer, darkroom, nail gun, or calculator. Fair enough. But we use these tools to achieve an outcome. What if the outcome was delivered by our code-drive-robot virtual assistant? The photo is retouched, or math problem calculated. Hmm … that feels like a service.
The context for our SaaS service delivery machine is constantly evolving. The actors in the system — prospects, customers, employees, technology touch points, partners, the broader competitive landscape — are not motionless. They are all “the product”. Our engineers are the product. HR is the product. The distinctions between engineering and the product team are imaginary.
As SaaS product managers we don’t ship product like a shoe company ships shoes. Rather, we oversee the emergence of a service delivery ecosystem. You can view Apple as a product and/or design company (and they certainly do both very well). Or you can view them as master service designers providing a lifetime of touch-point enabled experiences. Apple Care! Apple Store! Geniuses!
I frequently hear UX designers complain about agile software development. It causes us to cut corners! When can never “get it right”. I think that these things are vestiges of shipping wrapped/fixed/tangible products. And if you view it like that, an agile approach to software development will always feel shitty. It’s like design-by-a-thousand-cuts or building a grand sand castle one grain at a time … it feels incomplete and clumsy
But step back and think of your product as a swarm of service-delivering robots (and your human staff as a team of smart, warm, breathing service delivery agents), and suddenly the ability to change course, evolve, and adapt — like a restaurant evolving its menu and service — makes sense.
Consider all customer interactions with your company. Serve the customer, and not the product.

前回は、アーリー期のマーケットプレイス(MP)に関する5つの学びについて書かせて頂いた。その中で、MP同士の競争が激しくなる中で、SaaSとMPを両方提供する、SaaS-Enabled-Marketplace(SEM)の出現について簡単に触れた。今回は、SEMの現状をまとめつつ、特にB2BマーケットプレイスにおけるSEMの可能性等について、記載させて頂く。
SEMが浸透している業界
SaaS-Enabled Marketplace(SEM)型プレーヤー例と業界を以下の図に示す。
一般に、SEMが見つかりやすい業界とそうでない業界がある。この違いは何から来るのか？結論から言うと、売り手/買い手がソフトウェア/オンライン取引に慣れている成熟した業界では、SEMは一般的な傾向が強い。
例として、トラベル業界をイメージしてほしい。既にマーケットプレイスでは、売り手であるエアラインやホテル、買い手である消費者はオンライン予約が一般化している。そして、売り手であるエアラインやホテルでは、booking管理やCRMは当然ながら、ダイナミックプライシング等の価格最適化のSaaSも業界では長年一般化している。買い手である消費者向けにも、そこで価格比較のようなSaaS機能も意識せずに使っている。なので、RezdyやSwitchflyのようなSEM型のプレイヤーも多く存在する。
B2C vs B2B
次に、B2C vs B2Bの観点ではどうだろうか？
結論から言うと、AmazonのようなB2C、Zenefits、AtlassianのようなB2B、共に増えている。ただ、B2Cの方がB2BよりSaaS機能が作りやすい傾向があると考えられる。B2Cの場合、取引の管理のニーズはほぼ無く、”安く、早く買える”ための情報だけあれば良いので、SaaSがシンプルで済む。B2Bは、顧客(特に売り手)の業務課題を深く刺しにいく必要があるので、SaaSの構築が手間がかかりやすい。
但し、C2Cの場合は上記には当てはまらない。B2B同様、売り手側に取引管理のような、しっかりとしたSaaSが必要になる。例としては、オンラインレッスンのC2C MPであるLivementorでは、売り手であるチュータがレッスンの数を増やす、管理できるように、SaaSが提供されている。
SaaSで提供される主な機能
SEMで提供されるSaaSはどのようなものが多いのだろうか？
基本は、MPの成長は売り手側にドライブされるので、売り手向けのSaaSが多いので、その例を紹介する。(但し、SalesforceやZenefitsのように買い手側にSaaSを多く提供するSEMもある。)
・ 予約管理SaaS：リアルタイムの空き状況やキャンセル待ち、解析ツー ル等、CRMと連携して使われることが多い
・eコマース管理SaaS：受発注、シッピング管理のような取引に必要な機能の他、マーケティングの4Pに関わるような、オンラインプロモーション管理、ダイナミックプライシングツール等も開発されている
・販売/調達管理SaaS：主にB2BのMPで多いが、売り手の販売や調達を管理できる機能を提供する場合もある
・プロジェクト管理SaaS：クラウドソーシング系のMP（JIRAを提供するAtlassianやプロのマーケターMPであるDOZ）では、一般的になっている
B2C マーケットプレイスでは、超大手Amazonや、C2CのEtsyやUberなどC向け巨大プレイヤーが多く出てきている。一方、B2Bマーケットプレイスは期待されつつも、経営破たんしたCommerce One社の例など、成功例は多くはない。B2Bの売り手はMPだけだと、出品までのOnboard工程が手間だったり、十分なB2Bの買い手を集められず、期待したほどの取引ができなかったり、といった事が多い。そのため、MPを提供する前に、SaaSツールで顧客を引き付けられるSEMアプローチが効果的だ。
一番有名なB2B SEMの成功例は、既に評価額4,500億円超のHR Tech のユニコーン企業 Zenefitsだ。Zenefitsは買い手である企業のHR担当者向けに、給与計算/勤怠管理/従業員情報管理のSaaSを無料で提供して、売り手である保険会社の保険商品を、Zenefits上で企業/従業員が購入した際に、手数料を得ることで成長している。その他のB2B SEMの例として、国際物流のFreightosも１つだ。同社は運賃自動計算のSaaSを売り手である物流会社に提供し、買い手である輸出入業者との間でのMP機能も果たしている。
それでは、B2BのMPにとってSEMアプローチはメリットばかりなのか？私の意見として、メリットは多いが、デメリットもしっかり理解した上でSEMを扱うべきだと考える。以下にSEMのメリット・デメリットを示す。
SEMのメリット
・顧客獲得のスピード向上：特に無料でSaaSを提供する場合、普通にMPの顧客獲得をするより、スピーディーに顧客獲得をすることができる
・顧客のデータ獲得/信用情報獲得：B2B取引において、企業情報（規模、取引履歴等）は取引の信頼性を増すのみならず、MPでのマーケ施策を打つ上で非常に強い武器になる
・顧客リテンション/スティッキーさ向上：SaaSは一度業務に組み込まれると離脱しにくく、データ保管まですると、顧客の継続率は非常に高まる
・流通量の拡大：SaaSで取引管理をすると、顧客の流通への移行がしやすい。Winner takes allの傾向の強いMPでは非常に強い武器になる。また、特定の買い手に向けたキャンペーンを打つ等、リアルでは当然やられている施策も打ちやすくなる
・収益基盤の安定化：SaaSで月額課金する場合、季節要因などでぶれやすいMPの弱点を補うことができる。
SEMのデメリット
・複数のプロダクト開発/管理の煩雑さ：当然ながらスタートアップではリーンにプロダクト開発/改善を繰り返すが、その工数が倍増する。これはリソースの少ないスタートアップには大きなチャレンジになる。
・キャッシュアウトの早さ：当然ながら、複数のプロダクト開発が並行して走ると開発コストが上がり、資金のバーンレートが上がる。
・SaaS⇔MPのシナジーが産まれないリスク：特にSaaSから先に入る場合、必ずしもMPの取引につながるとは限らない。
個人的な意見としては、SEMのデメリットはありつつも、SEMアプローチはB2Bで拡大する上では非常に強い武器になると信じている。デメリットについても、狙う市場の競争環境にもよるが、MPから入り、PMFをやる中でSaaSのプロダクトコンセプトを練って、開発タイミングをずらすことで回避できる可能性は高いと考える。
最後に、B2B SEMアプローチを考える上で、SaaS機能を無料、もしくはフリミアムで提供すべきか — Free SaaS Enabled Marketplace(FSEM)―は重要な論点になる。ここでは、Redpoint Venturesの記事より、以下の7つ条件の場合、無料/フリミアムにするFSEMにする意味合いがあると考える。
ターゲット市場の特性からの条件
#1 顧客業界が古くウェブ取引を好まず、顧客獲得コストが高い
建設業や農業等、IT化になじみが薄い業界では起こるが、まずSaaSで顧客の業務課題を無料で解決し、信頼を勝ち取ることが必要となる。
#2 顧客数(特に売り手)が数万~数百万社以上と多い
SaaSの有料課金のCVRは一般に、5％未満と少ないため、あまりにも顧客数が少ないとSaaSで儲けることが難しい。逆に顧客数が少ない業界では、全て有料課金にしよう。これは、SaaS開発コストを回収する意味合いもあるが、売り手/買い手の数が少ないと、互いにMP外でつながってしまうため、収益の最大化の観点から、SaaSでしっかり課金が必要である。
#3 非常に競争環境が激しく、スピード優先の市場である
マーケットが巨大で、競合プレーヤーが多く、市場シェアを早く獲得することが重要な市場では、FSEMの選択肢が重要になってくる。この手の市場では、”winner takes all”になりやすいので、将来の回収可能性が高い
#4 GMV/手数料率の観点から、十分な売上が確保できる市場である
GMVは一般に、取引回数と単価にドライブされるが、逆相関の関係にある。つまり、単価が高いと取引回数は少ない傾向にある。その特徴を捉えた上で、手数料率を考える。一般にMPの手数料率は5–15％間が相場であるが、手数料率が10％以上と高く、取引回数と単価のバランスを踏まえて、MPで十分な収益が上がるならば、FSEMのアプローチが妥当である。
プロダクト特性や自社の状況からの条件
#5 SaaSが顧客の教育/MPへのリード創出ツールになっている
SaaS自体が顧客に適切な売買の教育機会を提供し、リード創出のツールになる場合は、FSEMがなじむ。なぜなら、SaaSによりSEM全体のユニットエコノミクスを改善するツールになるからだ(CACを下げ、LTVを上げる)。
#6 マーケットプレイスの特性が「市場創出型」である
MPの特性には、大きく2つタイプがある。
・「市場創出型」：既存の購入のハードルを下げたり、メディア的に働き、新規の需要を喚起したりするMP
・「デコンストラクション型」：既存市場で中間業者が多く、オンライン化により需要は増えないが、中間業者を取り除くMP
「市場創出型」は市場を広げ、SaaSを無料提供しても回収余地があるのでFSEMでもよいが、「デコンストラクション型」では市場自体が広がらないので、SaaS販売収入が重要になる。
＃7自社の保有する 資金が潤沢である
保有する資金がSaaSとMPの開発を十分でき、かつ上記の条件のどれかを満たすのであれば、戦略的にFSEMのオプションを取ることはありえる。
SaaSを有料にするか、無料にするかは重要な経営判断になるので、しっかり考えた上で実行するべきだ。ただ殊、日本のB2Bマーケットプレイスにおいては、初期ではFSEMを主軸にして、シェア獲得ができてからSaaSを有料課金に移行するのが良いかな、と個人的には思う。国内のB2B市場はフラグメントで縮小傾向、過去の商社モデルのおかげで「デコンストラクション型」MPが多い。また、SaaS自体の浸透もただでさえ時間がかかる(SIerのオンプレのおかげ)ので、SaaSを無料化して顧客獲得を一気に行う方が、エコノミクス的には成り立つと考える。

Having seen dozens of B2B SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) ventures growing, I have also seen lots of different organizational structures. Some failed, many were adjusted after a while, and very few have been a success from the beginning. Despite of its importance, there is little literature with a specialized focus on B2B software start-ups. Therefore, I want to give venture- as well as…

Valuations for SaaS are higher than they’ve ever been since we started keeping track of the data in Q4 2014: of the 77 SaaS companies we follow, the average public SaaS business is trading at 10.07x revenue while the median is 9.32x. The data is below.
Negative EBITDA, positive cash flow. The median SaaS business had trailing twelve month revenue of $302mm, EBITDA of -$16mm, but positive cash flow of $20mm thanks to deferred revenue and up-front collections on annual contracts. Indeed so long as you’re growing (the median annual growth rate is 14%), investors will overlook negative EBITDA especially if the business is cash flow positive after working capital changes.
Growth doesn’t explain high valuations. As for growth, at 14% YOY, we’ve never seen it this low. It’s not terrible, but the sector historically has grown at 25% to 30%+. It’s also concerning to see growth at a low but the revenue multiple at a high. The profitability profile hasn’t changed (the majority of our list is unprofitable as it has always been), so it’s unclear to us why investors are willing to pay 9.32x revenue. The only reason we can think of is that markets in general are overvalued and SaaS is benefitting from investors generally overpaying for companies.
SaaS businesses are healthy. There is almost no debt on these businesses — banks don’t like ‘asset-lite’ businesses like software. Additionally, these companies have $166mm of cash on the balance sheet on median, equivalent to 1 years of burn (recall EBITDA is -$16mm). The number of years of cash on the balance sheet is less important given that these businesses are generally cash flow positive (median of $20mm), and indeed only 14 out of the 77 have negative cash flow. Note that 46 out of the 77 have negative EBITDA, but again that’s acceptable so long as the growth is there and cash flow overall is positive.
Recent IPO’s are killing it. The 4 latest SaaS IPO’s (Docusign, Smartsheet, Z-Scaler, Zuora) are trading at an average valuation of 19.75x revenue. That’s unreal and frankly non-sensical. It shows that now is a great time to come to market whether you’re raising money or selling the business.
So what’s this data mean for a fast growing private SaaS business? Public multiples and trends tend to guide what’s happening in the private markets: i) as compensation for illiquidity, size, and lack of profitability, prudent investors will look to invest in your private SaaS business somewhere below the 10x average unless your growth rate is demonstrably higher than 14% YOY; ii) financing will continue to come from equity, less so from debt, although we’ve seen banks like Bridge Bank get more aggressive and lenders like Lighter Capital get more creative; iii) and burning cash is still acceptable on an EBITDA basis, so long as free cash flow is positive or moving in the right direction. Finally, given the high revenue multiples, now is an excellent time to sell your business or raise money.

Famously, “Software is eating the world”, and I would add: at a fast pace!
In my opinion, there are two key reasons for that:
a) Software development reached an unprecedented speed.
b) Online marketing enables fast and scalable distribution of software.
The increase in development speed is driven by the innovation of re-using existing blocks. Basically, developers don’t need to reinvent the wheel every day.
Chris Dixon just pointed that every era of computing creates platforms for innovation. In the PC era, a developer didn’t design and build the parts of a computer to develop a game. Today, you won’t build a datacenter to bring an app to the market, AWS is the default choice.
But that, not only happens with computing eras. That also happens with the software stack.
Nobody designs a new language for a new piece of software, we leverage what’s available.
The same happens with most critical parts of software development.
Unless you’re a database provider, you won’t consider developing a new database technology.
These platforms allow the modularization and continuous innovation in software development.
Everybody enjoys faster development processes building on top of somebody else’s efforts.
One of the most elegant ways of creating an open platform is open source. NOTE — I love open source, I’m writing this in atom.io from my ubuntu laptop.
Generalizing a bit, open source projects tend to be a collaborative effort of independent developers. Its result is a free “community edition” product, which has unique competitive advantages:
Because of that, plenty of open source projects become winner-takes-most in their markets. No surprise, open source is key in the infrastructure of almost every tech company — operating systems, databases, languages, etc.
But one thing is getting adoption and a different one is making money.
The two prevalent open source business models have proven hard to crack. Until today, only a couple of companies did it.
Traditionally, in open source, you can make money by either:a) Charging professional services, which usually have lower margins and don’t scale so well. b) Charging enterprise licenses, which is challenging when most ‘community editions’ provide the core value and there’s so much info available on how to modify, implement and scale them.
As a result of that, when compared with other business models, few large businesses have been built on top of open source.
At first, comparing SaaS with open source might sound bizarre because in plenty of cases they are mutually exclusive.
But I think it’s relevant, since most of the infrastructure stack is getting SaaS-ified.
One example from our portfolio is pretty illustrative of that competition:
Today, the CTO of a company can spend engineering resources to build their search solution with Elasticsearch or buy speed with Algolia’s SaaS. The same could be said about contentful, keen.io, and many other API-first/-only companies.
Obviously, the SaaS product might be less customizable, but the benefits for its customers are also clear: shorter development time and more transparent costs. No more hidden costs in the form of maintenance.
If SaaS can be great for the customer, it’s even more attractive for the startup vendor and its early stage investors:
But in SaaS nirvana there are challenges too. The reliability and privacy of the cloud bring friction to move customers’ data and critical infrastructure into SaaS. That’s one of the obvious cases where open source wins. That said, in my opinion, we are in a transition phase until most of those concerns disappear — unless “somebody” breaks customer’s trust.
Apart from that, we would agree that SaaS goes into the opposite direction of a building block for open innovation. SaaS has quite strong lock-in effects: it “owns” the customer data — and its code is closed. That means it’s hard to build something on top of a SaaS provider.
And that was true, until APIs came to the market…
Again, comparing APIs with SaaS might sound counter-intuitive. In practice, most APIs are delivered in the form of a SaaS. But I think there are enough differences between both models to make a distinction.
Some of those differences, in my opinion, allow APIs to solve the key challenges of SaaS:
APIs are building blocks of software by definition
Compared with SaaS, by nature, they are platforms that allow development on top of them.
It brings back the nature of “building block” that open source has and SaaS lost.
API’s businesses focus on solving “smaller” problems but hard to crack
For that reason, there are higher chances that customers will trust an API provider for their core infrastructure.
“If this is the only thing those guys do, there’s high chances they will do it better than myself”.
Obviously, it’s still very early to tell if APIs will end up eating SaaS or just be a natural extension of it. I’m very bullish that the next building blocks of the software will be in the form of APIs, but that’s a topic for another post …
There are plenty of opinions in that post, I would love to hear yours.Do you agree? Or disagree?

It sounds simple — but it’s not easy: talking with your customers through every stage of the customer lifecycle. There’s been a lot said about the value of talking to your customers before you build the product to ensure market fit, but very little said about continuing the conversation past marketing and past the sale.
Why do I know talking with your customer is *the* very best predictor of, and contributor to, SaaS business growth? Because creating a constant flow of customer feedback, input, and conversation makes Customer Experience (CX) better.
Multiple studies show that CX leads to revenue growth.
CX also drives brand advocacy (aka. word of mouth), creating a virtual sales army, which leads to:
Decreased cost-to-acquire.
“Customers with the best past experiences spend 140% more than those with the poorest past experiences.” — Harvard Business Review
Increased customer lifetime value.
“Customers with the best past experiences have a 74% chance of remaining a member for at least another year.” — Harvard Business Review
Plus, qualitative customer research leads to making data-informed decisions that streamline product management, ensure customer success, and make marketing and sales far more efficient.
In short, as Laura Klein, author, VP of product, and co-founder of Users Know says,
“User research saves time. Period. When you actually understand what your user needs before you build things, you have a much lower chance of having to go back and rebuild everything after shipping something that nobody uses.”
It’s not like you’re inviting them over for tea and cookies every week for a casual catch-up (though that would be awesome, and you should do that and invite me).
When we say “talk to your customers,” or “listen to your customers,” I usually mean getting on the phone with them (or better, meeting up with them in person). But, it can also mean sending surveys that include long-form response fields, or building quicker in-app surveys into your roadmap to uncover moments of friction.
And, of course, if you’re earlier in your business, there’s the Lean approach of interviewing dozens of target customers in person and over the phone — groundwork that helps founders (and product developers and marketers) form better hypotheses around what will deliver the best product-market fit.
There’s also user testing.
These are all valid ways of listening to your customers. But I’d like to advocate for doing all of these things and going several steps further. I’m talking about combining all of the above and adding genuine conversations to the mix.
It’s just not input. It’s just not feedback. It’s getting to know your customers as human beings and building relationships with them that drive positive CX far more powerfully than any of these elements could do alone.
So much has been written about interviewing customers prior to developing products that I’d like to focus on how to keep communication lines open after the launch, after customer acquisition, starting with onboarding.
The first key to ensuring communication stays clear and open is to observe your customers. We communicate far more by our actions than we do verbally, and tracking the actions of your customers, especially (but not limited to) during onboarding can tell you the truths you need to hear.
Tracking customer behavior during onboarding and throughout product use allows you to see:
Yes, you want to track how well your customers accomplish the required tasks outlined in your User Flow, but usually, tracking stops there. If they press the right buttons at the right times, if they input the requested information, if they log in relatively regularly, it’s easy to assume customers are happily using your product.
But that’s not always the case. There may be ‘success gaps’ you can’t see that are causing churn. FYI: A ‘success gap’ is “the gap between what you think represents the customers’ successful use of your product and what they think equates to success,” according to Lincoln Murphy.
This is where aptly timed in-app surveys come in handy, which I’ll get to in the next section.
Tools that can help:
While you’re tracking user behaviors, successes and failures, you’ll also want to check in with your users in an unobtrusive way to get their feedback at specific points in their user journeys.
For example, if you identify a page or prompt during onboarding that tends to ‘lose’ people, have a trigger-based in-app AI chatbot pop up and offer to clarify, or transfer them to an agent. (This, incidentally, would have saved my relationship with more than one app! If you hit a ‘wall’ during onboarding, the odds of completing the process and becoming a successful customer are terrible — unless you get timely help).
You can set up event trigger-based surveys to deploy when users spend too much time on a page, ‘click away’ before completing the action, or when they’ve been ‘dormant’ (not logging in) for a while.
By giving customers opportunities to tell you they’re confused, are experiencing failure, aren’t getting the results they’d hoped for, or are suffering from a lack of time/motivation/technical skills etc., you will know who is really at risk of churning in time to save them, and really impress them with your customer service skills.
Another place where checking in with your customer can really pay off is after the onboarding sequence is complete. It’s a perfect time to ask “How difficult was this?” (aka. A Customer Effort Score survey). The easier a process is, the less friction people experience, and the more likely they will be to complete your desired actions and reach their desired outcomes.
Then, after your new user has had a chance to put your product to work, you should send out a Net Promoter Score survey (NPS) to find out how they *really* feel about your product. Do they like it enough to recommend it to a friend or colleague? That’s an excellent indicator of how well they’re succeeding. And be sure to send an NPS follow-up question to understand the why behind the score.
Tools that can help:
Wootric: For these types of in-app surveys, I recommend Wootric. Their dashboard makes it very easy to understand what you’re seeing, and they do great work with extrapolating insights from qualitative data questions too.
Tracking what customers do and asking them what they think at strategic points is a very good start; the trouble is, that’s where most SaaS companies begin and end. But SaaS businesses are subscription-based. They’re in this for the long-haul. They depend on customers sticking around (customer lifetime value! retention!).
And that means you also have to build relationships with your customers.
This is why I so strongly advocate that SaaS companies build social communities around their products. It’s an opportunity to relate to your customers as people.
The bonuses are many. SaaS product communities give you:
The most important thing to remember about building a community is that it’s not a one-sided arrangement. This isn’t a place for you to ‘shout into the void’, post blog posts nobody reads, try to ‘sell’ or advertise. It’s a place where you and your customers can come together around your common interests. Human to human.
Tools that can help:
When you are tracking user behavior in your product, identifying predictive patterns of behaviors/successes/failures, locating trouble-spots and offering timely help, checking in with surveys to ask your customers what they think — in their own words and with numerical ratings, AND forging human-to-human relationships in the casual setting of social media groups, you’ll see a few things happen…

Build your business for the long-term with these proven strategies
Let’s face it, bringing in new customers as a SaaS startup can be a complex and costly endeavour — no two ways about it. Many times you’ll find yourself throwing in as much time, money, and energy as needed in order to get someone onboard only to feel drained in more ways than one in the end.
It’s important to understand that getting a handle on your customer acquisition costs (CAC) can make or break the future of your business.
High acquisition costs are unsustainable for the longevity of a business, and having unreasonably low expectations of what your costs should be can cause well-intentioned and well-directed efforts to fall flat on their arse.
Source
So how do you know if your customer acquisition costs are too high? Well, first things first — you have to know what they are. This is a foundational aspect — a cornerstone if you will — of your business.
Customer acquisition costs are calculated using a straightforward formula:
Total Cost of Marketing / Total Number of Customers
So, if you spent $1000 on marketing your software for a certain length of time and during that time you acquired 50 new customers, your acquisition cost would be $20.
So what does that number mean? Well, in order to interpret this number, you’ll need to know your customer’s lifetime value. Your customer’s lifetime value is calculated as follows:
Source
So, let’s say your software service is licensed out at a rate of $50/mo and your average customer usually signs up for a 12-month subscription.
The calculation would be 50 x 1 x 12.
In this case, your average customer lifetime value would be $600.
Now, according to your previous estimates on customer acquisition cost, this would get you in the clear. If the average cost of acquiring a customer is $20, but their overall lifetime customer value is $600, then you are in tip-top shape.
However, many times we find ourselves reluctantly dealing with high acquisition costs and low customer lifetime values.

When it comes to conversion rate optimization, you’ll need to have a well-defined strategy as well as a set of tactics and procedures to implement. You’ll also need a robust analytics platform in order to measure your designated key performance indicators (KPIs) for optimal goal achievement.
Conversion rate optimization is a process involving tweaking your various search ads, landing pages, and website design to optimize them for conversions.
When you get into the nitty-gritty details of the process, it can prove to be highly effective in getting individuals to take the desired actions of your choice.
Source
Some techniques for increasing conversion rate optimization include writing compelling PPC ads that are optimized for SEO. Doing this will enhance the quality of the audience that sees your ads.
CTAs should be above the fold, and lead capture forms should be straightforward and simple. Additionally, making sure that your opt-in offers are enticing is critical, so using incentives such as free trials, demos, and upgraded content can prove very helpful.
Making use of split-testing and clarifying your unique value proposition (UVP) while keeping it above the fold for maximum exposure are other techniques that can be extremely beneficial.
In fact, every single block of text, image, or message should have a specific purpose to further your end goal.
If уоu hаvеn’t done thіѕ аlrеаdу, you’re mіѕѕіng out оn a mаjоr opportunity tо сut hоurѕ, resources, as well as energy spent capturing аnd оrgаnіzіng іnfоrmаtіоn, ѕеgmеntіng your соntасtѕ, сrеаtіng CTAs, and just about everything else you could think of.

Thе rіght аutоmаtіоn рlаtfоrm wіll bе a full-funnеl ѕоlutіоn whеrе уоu саn easily vіеw соntасt rесоrdѕ/асtіvіtу аnd the data thаt represents thе ѕuссеѕѕ оf уоur саmраіgnѕ.
On average, about 45% of companies are already implementing some form of marketing automation for their business. Even more interesting is the fact that 91% of those companies concur that automation is “very important” to the overall success of their agenda.
Let’s be real: When it соmеѕ tо dаtа, уоu’rе рrоbаblу gоіng tо need mоrе than juѕt a mаrkеtіng аutоmаtіоn рlаtfоrm to hеlр уоu undеrѕtаnd уоur ріреlіnе аnd manage it wеll.

Sometimes an entire overhaul may be necessary in order to maximize the efficiency of the process and communication between various platforms.

It wіll be tough to reduce your cuѕtоmеr acquisition costs in the lоng term unlеѕѕ уоu’rе dоіng some form of tеѕtіng. A/B testing to help gauge which design and formatting options prove to be most effective is also necessary.
Split-testing is going to be a key factor in the success of your endeavors because it takes a scientific approach to customer acquisition, and the numbers simply don’t lie.

Aѕ a buѕіnеѕѕ owner оr marketer, your daily lіfе is filled wіth buѕу work, and certain tactics, strategies, and processes tend to yield much better results than others.
Keeping the Pareto Principle at the forefront of your mind is going to be necessary for you to focus your efforts to achieve maximum effectiveness.
The Pareto Principle states that for many events, 80% of the effects come from approximately 20% of the causes. This is often true for businesses and their customers as well as business and marketing processes.

The lоngеr іt tаkеѕ tо соnvеrt уоur leads into сuѕtоmеrѕ, the hіghеr уоur сuѕtоmеr acquisition соѕt wіll bе. So stop attracting a low-quality audience that won’t convert to your buѕіnеѕѕ website.
Optimize your content and web pages with the right keywords so that you can attract a high-quality audience that has a higher probability of converting. This is one way to help target your efforts more precisely.
Make sure your company is performing in-depth keyword research, making use of long-tail keywords, and optimizing content, allowing you to generate high-quality leads with higher probabilities for conversion.
The key to any successful marketing strategy begins with knowing your viewers and creating an in-depth and accurate buyer persona so that you can adequately visualize your ideal customer.
Source
A raving fanbase is the key to driving virality and lowering the cost of your marketing efforts. These types of customers are truly passionate about a product, and they like to interact with other lovers.
One of the best assets a company can have is a loyal, passionate customer base to help spread the word about your services and products. Generating enthused customers takes time, energy, and consistent efforts at relationship building.
But the results are insane — 100 % free marketing, 100 % free advertising, and serious long-term customers and referrers.
Never ignore the power of customer appreciation. It may sound basic, but it’s when customers find a company that really shows they care for them, they respond exceptionally positively in return.
The reason this is often neglected is that many companies focus so much on converting a lead into a sale that they fail to nurture a sale into a loyal customer.
How do you show client appreciation in your business? Don’t forget about an individual once a sale is made. Nurture them into a loyal customer with a high lifetime value.
Source
One of the biggest downfalls of SaaS startups is the CAC. For a SaaS company to be successful, it has to discover a way out to reduce the customer acquisition cost and generate income from the customers during their lifetime relationship.
Calculate and document your customer acquisition costs to get a solid baseline to work from. Make use of conversion rate optimization and marketing automation to help focus your resources more efficiently.
Sometimes it may be necessary to do an entire overhaul in order to optimize your processes; other times, a simple automation platform with proper integration will suffice.
You can’t carry out an effective strategy without measuring, analyzing performance, and testing various scenarios and processes. This is the key to optimal efficiency, and it’s also a way for you to decide which of your efforts are the most effective (80/20 rule).
Through precise targeting and proper nurturing, you’re able to cultivate leads into a loyal consumer fan base.
Remember that the overall goal of any SaaS business is to drive down the cost of customer acquisition while driving up the customer lifetime value. So get ahead of the game and implement some of these proven strategies for long-term sustainability today.
If you have any tools, strategies and ideas for lowering CAC or even driving up LTV then please let me know and let’s discuss.

This post originally appeared on the Plainflow Blog
A few weeks ago Hiten Shah explained in a new interesting post why the most successful SaaS companies of the future will focus on usage, just like Facebook. In the write-up, he goes very deep into his explanation bringing examples of world-class SaaS companies like Trello, Slack, and Dropbox that are all building their strategies around this consumer-oriented product approach.
He predicts that this is how the next generation of SaaS will look like.
While I was reading Hiten’s post, I immediately recalled a frugal email conversation I had last month with Patrick Campbell, CEO at Price Intelligently.
Patrick briefly introduced me to the definition of what he calls “anti-active usage” products.
While at first, this might sound very counterintuitive, it’s actually the natural evolution of most of the SaaS products that we know today.
Harnessing the world of software in a single statement is very hard. Tom Tunguz explained in a post on the blog his vision about software in a simple way.
Software world divides into systems of record and workflow applications.
Systems of record unify data from different sources under a single view. Common applications of Systems of record are CRM and ERP.
Here’s how the value chain for systems of record looks like:
Workflow applications enable workers to do work. These products represent a huge portion of the products that we use in our daily work life.
Here’s the value chain for workflow applications:
Systems of records and workflow applications have one thing in common, at their core level they need some human interactions.
The paradigm under which you have to actively use something to do a given task or to reach a certain goal is the bedrock of most of the SaaS products out there.
Anti-active usage products flip this model — you don’t necessarily need to use the product to get something done because the product (1) understands the problem, (2) works out a solution and (3) outputs a result. Anti-active usage products don’t need human interactions at any level of their value-chain.
We can expect in 10 years from now, a good part of today’s SaaS product flocking to this new category:
There are many reasons I see why anti-active SaaS products might come in the next 10 years:
Let’s clarify a few areas where products can be more suitable for this transition.
We can expect anti-active usage products mainly falling into these three categories:
On the other side, products that require a deep level of human interactions, or empathy are probably still not ready for this transition. Same for all those workflow applications that require some tactical or strategic thinking when using them.
Let’s dig in a bit and take the real example of Social Media Scheduler SaaS product:
Traditional workflow for an active user:
In your ideal world, this what happens. Each Monday your user logs in, she performs some actions in the product, she periodically makes some tweaks and she keeps her eyes on some of the metrics your product pulled out. The more users you have like this, the better.
On contrary, when your sales and your revenue outrun usage and adoption something bad is happening. Because you know that when customers realize that they are paying for something they are not using, it creates a perfect storm for churn.
With Anti-Active Usage products, this model doesn’t work. They don’t require your users to be engaged at any level with the product. This is how a possible workflow would look like:
The end-user doesn’t need to do anything in the product. The SaaS doesn’t need the intervention of the user during all its value chain. The product is able to work in complete autonomy and yet, it’s able to deliver outcomes.
At its core level every product wants to be able to find an answer to the following question:
Am I relevant for my users?
Pretty much every week I see new articles that try to give their interpretation on the topic. One of the good read I saw has been written last week by Josh Elman from Greylock Partners: The Only Metric That Matters.
Long story short, we answered the question “Do my users care about my product?” with another answer “Are people using your product?“.
The vast majority of SaaS products relied for years on the idea that if your users keep coming back to your product to perform a certain action, then they are finding something valuable in what you offer.
This simple equation has been considered for years the bedrock of every successful software product.
Engagement is one of the best predictors of success.
On the other side, if your users are not coming back to your product, they land .. and leave, then you have some growth problem. You user don’t stick, and if your users aren’t sticky, churn will be high, and you won’t have engagement.
In reality, when we try to find to answer the question “Do my users care about my product?” we are trying to measure something that we can’t know with certainty.
So we pick up a metric to approximate the actual underlying user behavior. This is what Sriram Krishnan defines in this interesting essay a proxy metric.
The process we ran into when we defined product-usage as the best proxy metric is called reification and it’s one of the principles of the well-known Gestalt effect.
Reification is the constructive or generative aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based.
For instance, you perceived a triangle in picture A, though no triangle is there. In pictures B and D the eye recognizes disparate shapes as “belonging” to a single shape, in C a complete three-dimensional sphere is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.
Reification allows you to infer the abstract (unknown) by treating the illusionary contours (known) of a visual system as “real” contours.
We do this natural approximation all the time when we pick up a metric — no exception when we are trying to infer if our users find our product valuable by looking at their usage.
Anti-active usage products break this rule and revert the paradigm by pushing us to think way beyond the idea of retention in terms of product engagement.
When your product works in full autonomy and yet, it’s able to deliver outcomes, user engagement is not what you want to optimize for. So while usage and engagement are all good proxy metrics for most of the consumer-facing products, for anti-active usage SaaS products, these are fallacious metrics. In these cases finding the right proxy-metrics is harder, often very counterintuitive and it requires you to think in a holistic way.
In the next 10 years, a lot of SaaS products will flock from traditional systems of records and workflow applications to the anti-active usage products category. A relevant portion of today’s SaaS companies might not even have the log-in button and for those products, usage and engagement might not be the only metrics that matter.

Since I wrote “The Rise of Non “VC compatible” SaaS Companies” I’ve been in touch with many bootstrapped founders, brokers or SaaS acquirers and I’ve followed the development of the space by reading articles and listening to podcasts.
The following post is a summary of what I saw evolving the past 12 to 18 months and some implications for the near future. I’ve structured my observations around the four stages of a startup lifecycle:
Why do you, as a VC, even care about this topic?
Because we are witnessing some significant changes in our industry (increasing number of saturated software categories, the rise of non-VC compatible SaaS, saturation of several traditional distribution channels) which impact the overall market and how we assess early-stage companies. It’s our job to understand these changes and to share our thoughts with the community.
The main aspects which have changed the past 12 to 18 months are definitely the maturation of the community and the explosion of resources and events around that topic. Whether it’s blog posts, Slack/email groups, forums, newsletters, events or podcasts, more and more people talk about how to start and run a bootstrap SaaS. The community is now quite structured and stronger.
The “VC backed” approach was more documented than its “doppelganger”, a.k.a the bootstrapped approach, and even if some people, like the folks at Basecamp, have been promoting it for years, it was still somehow perceived as a less prestigious path. But it’s changing as the SaaS industry is maturing and as an increasing number of “role models” are emerging.
I also meet an increasing number of ambitious early-stage SaaS founders who explain that they don’t want to raise money with VCs (not too early at least) and have a clear plan to go to profitability asap. It was not the case a couple of years ago.
A positive implication is that this “inferiority complex” is fading away. Starting a business and going the bootstrapped way is not perceived as a lack of ambition anymore (it’s sometimes quite the opposite) and founders don’t hesitate to be vocal about it. Not only this explosion of resources makes it easier to start such an adventure, but it also becomes “sexier” to do so.
That said, a potential danger of this situation is that it’s attracting an increasing number of people who have “no clue” about SaaS and who think it’ll be a smooth ride. The majority of bootstrapped SaaS founders I was speaking to a year ago were either developers or former employees of SaaS companies. The majority knew that starting a SaaS business was not easy and they knew on what to focus (PM-Fit and relevant metrics).
Now that the community is growing I meet more people who want to start a SaaS because they read a blog post or heard a podcast about a founder who left his job, built a SaaS and is now traveling the world and drinking Pina Coladas while its product generates $10k per month.
The truth is, SaaS is hard. I expect an increasing number of people joining the trend, but as they underestimate the difficulty to succeed, we’ll see more disappointment and frustration.
I’ve seen more awesome bootstrapped SaaS businesses emerging, and an increasing number of them share their story publicly, which will lead to the rise of copycats.
Sharing founders’ knowledge and successes publicly is a good thing, overall, for the ecosystem. However, the downside risk is that it’ll also attract people who like to take shortcuts.
Hence the rise of the bootstrapped SaaS copycats. Getting to product market fit is still extremely hard, this is why some people prefer not to take this risk and simply copy a concept that was proven to work.
And discovering successful bootstrapped startups is easier since there are plenty forums, online groups, and podcast covering them. The problem is that many of these businesses are run by small teams and have only a nascent brand in their niche, they are not as defensible as bigger companies and are potentially more vulnerable to copycats.
My prediction is that we’ll see more and more of these copycats and it will make running a bootstrapped SaaS business much riskier. We’ve already seen it happening for “VC backed” companies and the bootstrapped SaaS community will need to figure out how to deal with that.
As the SaaS market is maturing, the number of saturated software categories, like Martech, is increasing. However, in such environments smaller and leaner bootstrapped companies can still strive.
These companies very often need some cash upfront to finance their cash flow or their growth. Hence the rise of alternatives “debt based“ financing players that we’ve witnessed the past years( ex: SaaS Capital).
To be honest, I saw a couple more players appearing in the space the past year, but I cannot say it was an explosion. What’s evolving is their model and their approach of the market.
I think these alternatives debt financing players will gain in importance in the bootstrapped SaaS space:
To which levels and at which pace? It’s hard to say, but I expect more a “linear growth” type of trend rather than something as crazy as the ICO explosion / madness.
Another interesting aspect is that we’ll probably see more companies skipping the early stage financing round with VCs, bootstrap to a couple hundreds of thousands or millions dollars of MRR and then decide to either raise big time with VCs or to keep bootstrapping.
Out of the four elements I’ve listed in this post, the “exit” aspect is probably the one that I’ve seen evolving the most the past 12 to 18 months. After I wrote my post on non-VC compatible SaaS, quite a few people who are in the business of acquiring SaaS contacted me.
But who wants to acquire bootstrapped SaaS and for which reasons?
Over the past months I’ve discussed with an increasing number of these “specialised” funds and what’s interesting is that each has its particular approach and model. Many are still in an exploring mode and are figuring out how to manage a portfolio of profitable SaaS companies.
I think we’ll see an increasing number of exits in the bootstrapped SaaS space.
First because in many cases it makes sense for founders to sell their bootstrapped business. Tyler Tringas explains it well in “Selling My Bootstrapped SaaS Business”: from financial incentives to the desire of starting something new, many of these founders don’t want to spend ten years working on the same project.
Second because if a wave of copycats is coming it’ll make sense for many founders to sell before they struggle with too much competition (opportunistic sales).
Third because more and more bootstrapped SaaS manage to reach the $5M — $10M ARR threshold and it makes them good acquisition targets for Private Equity firms or bigger SaaS companies. This is especially true for saturated software categories where incumbents buy other companies to diversify their offer and expand to new markets. See for example BuzzSumo which got acquired by Brandwatch.
Fourth because the “profitable SaaS portfolio” approach seems to be hot at the moment, so I expect more “specialized funds” to emerge or existing startup studios trying this approach.

日本のスタートアップ業界では、「SaaSの春」と言わんばかりに、年々盛り上がりを見せ、ここ最近では資金調達も含め、SaaS関連のニュースを見ない日はないくらいだ。（SaaS好き投資家としては、ホント嬉しい。）
目を転じて、SaaSの家元であるアメリカの動向も見ると、日本に負けず劣らず、再び盛り上がってきている。昨日のSalesforce.comの18/2Qでの好業績のニュースはもちろんのこと、SaaS系スタートアップの資金調達も直近の18年前半は過去最高レベルにまで、再びSaaS熱が上がってきている。その全体像をざっと理解するために、直近の米SaaS業界のトレンドを、上場企業(Part I)、M&A(Part II)、スタートアップ(Part III)の3回に分けて、数字を中心にみてみたい。PartIの今回は、米Software Equity Groupのレポートをベースに、74社の米SaaS上場企業の数字をざっとまとめてみる。
まず米上場SaaS企業の売上と売上成長率は、どう変わっているのか？（数字については、基本TTM(直近12ヵ月の実績)ベース、中央値(メジアン)で評価。以降も同様。）
左図で分かる通り、米SaaS上場企業の売上の中央値は、ここ一年で約250億円から約300億円、年成長率 +30％をキープし、順調に成長している。売上成長率別にSaaS上場企業の割合を見てみる(右図)と、+20％超の高い成長率の企業割合は、1年で約+3ポイントで約70%まで増えている。
米SaaS上場企業が、順調な成長を続ける中、売上マルチプル(PSR)はどう変わっているのか？左図の通り、これまで6.5x近辺で推移していたのに対し、2Qでは7.6xと一気に上昇している。前述の成長率が約+30％で変化していないことを踏まえると、全体感としてはSaaSへの投資が少し過熱していると考えられる。では、売上成長率と売上マルチプルの関係はどうか？右図を見れば一目瞭然だが、売上成長率が高いと比例して、売上マルチプルも上がっている。この事象は、SaaSの未上場スタートアップ企業の売上マルチプル(Bessemer VPによると、15.9x!）が上場企業よりも高い要因の1つになっている（賛否両論あるが）。
目を転じて、一般的なPERベースの企業価値評価に使われるEBITDAのトレンドはどうか？中央値ベースだと、米SaaS上場企業はまだ赤字の会社がほとんど。右図のEBITDA%(マージン)で半数以上の55％が赤字であることからも判る。一方、注目に値するのが、EBITDA％がプラスに転じた企業においては、EBITDAの成長率が30％→50％と改善(左図)が見られ、連動するようにEBITDA%がプラスの企業割合も5ポイント改善して、全体の半数に近づいている。これも、SaaSへの投資が過熱してる一因の可能性はある。
ただ、EBITDAマルチプル(PER)の変化で見てみるとどうか？驚くべきことに、EBITDAマルチプル自体は下落傾向にある。また、EBITDA%別のマルチプルを見てみても、確かにEBITDA%が20％を超える高利益率のSaaS企業の売上マルチプルは高い傾向はあるものの、売上成長率ほどは相関が無い。つまり、投資家もEBITDA%は言うほど評価していない。より売上成長率を重視して投資をしていることが判る。
では、売上成長率+EBITDA%の和でSaaS企業健全性を測る、いわゆる”40%ルール”で見るとどうだろうか？EBITDA％単体よりは、相関は見られるものの、売上成長率ほど連続性のある相関は見られない。故に、SaaS企業の経営者が、利益率を改善するより、売上成長率を上げるために投資を続けた方が企業価値の向上につながると考えるのは当然だ。ただ、規模が大きくなると、高い売上成長率を追求し続けることは難しくなる。従って、SaaS企業の経営者もEBITDA%をゼロに近づけて、可能な限り営業とマーケに投資することで、市場の評価を安定させようとしていると考えられる。そのため、40％ルールも、実際は売上成長率+EBITDA%>20％になると、売上マルチプルが8x超と高くつくあたりからも、”20%”あたりがある意味、1つの目安とも言える。
ではSaaSの経営者は、本当に売上成長率を維持するために、営業＆マーケ費用につぎ込んでいるのか？下図の通り、結論から言うと、Yesだ。粗利率は改善させる一方で、営業＆マーケ費用の売上比は少しずつ上昇していることからも判る。（ちなみに別の観点で見ると、SaaSのコスト構造の目安として、粗利70％、営業＆マーケ費用は売上の40％と言える。)
最後に、ホリゾンタルSaaS vs. バーティカルSaaS、CRMやHRなど、タイプ別で売上マルチプルに差があるのか、見てみる。結論から言うと、前年同Qの変化率を見てみても、本質的にSaaSのタイプが企業価値評価に相関しているようには見えない。（長期トレンドで見る必要があるが）
以上、米SaaS上場企業の最近のトレンドを見た。ざっくりまとめると、
・米SaaS上場企業は安定成長から、投資が少し過熱気味
・上場後も投資家は、利益率<<売上成長率
・ただ、規模が大きくなると、40％ルールを意識して、利益率と売上成長率のバランスを取る必要
・なので、SaaS企業の経営者もコストコントロールはしつつ、売上成長のメインドライバーである売上/マーケコストを増加
・SaaSタイプは関係なく、結局は売上成長率（多分）
次回のPart IIでは、米SaaS企業の最近のM&Aトレンドを数字で見てみる。

I was recently at an event with a SaaS-ish CEO who was, clearly, miserable. His business was doing $30m+ and growing nicely. He was about to introduce a new product that he thought could be game-changing. And, he had a strong team (according to him) that he truly enjoyed working with.
What was so bad? I don’t know exactly. But what I do know is that he was experiencing what almost all SaaS founders experience once on the 7–10 year SaaS journey — The Year of Hell.
This is never the first year. As tough as that first year is, that’s still an exploration. You are learning, just trying to get something off the ground. It will be incredibly stressful, full of drama, and have some near-death moments. But that struggle is … what it is. You make it, or you don’t, and you’re still in your hyper-creative period, figuring something new out, which is always stimulating.
No, the Year of Hell comes later. It comes post-Traction, usually. Sometimes post-Scale, like with the CEO above, sometimes before. But it comes when you see the other edge of the expanse, the way back to the Alpha quadrant … you see it … but it’s that one year when it’s just too darn hard on every level to keep slugging it out. You’re just under assault on too many fronts.
Now, this isn’t a particularly profound insight, other that to say, Trust Me. Other than to say, I’ve talked with a lot of SaaS CEOs and founders — and almost all of them who’ve done it long enough have had One Year of Hell. So if you’re in your Year of Hell, you’ll get through it. We’ve all been there. Accept it and keep pointing to True North, to the Alpha Quadrant.
My personal Year of Hell was 2008. The leads were there, the customer base was there … but we started to spend a lot of money, and it just wasn’t clicking. It was a tough year. You can basically see it here in our Google Trends:
The strange thing to me isn’t that almost everyone has a Year of Hell. The strange thing to me is that when people come through it, if they do come through it — then many and even most times it seems, the business does more than just improve. It Reignites.
I don’t exactly know why. I’ve asked myself that question, why it happened to us. You can see our chart above. And I’ve asked a lot of other SaaS founders. You hear a lot of different reasons — a great VP Sales (helped a lot with us), a big advance of the product (with us too), some self-wounds by a competitor. Or maybe it’s just market pull. The reality is, I don’t think people always exactly know.
So what I really think happens is that somehow, in the Year of Hell, you pick yourself up and start trying lots of things. And some combination of them click, not immediately, but they start working at some level. And during that year, you still grow. And as we know in SaaS, success builds on itself. It compounds.
And you will, quite likely, if you keep at it in your Year of Hell — see Reignition. A true re-acceleration of growth. It may be a full year after the Year of Hell (what we saw). I don’t know when. But Reignition does happen quite often. It’s a glorious thing. And just know, I think if you get to Scale, and you have good customers and a decent product, and you keep at it with 100% dedication — I think unless the entire market collapses (rare in true SaaS) — you’ll see Reignition too.
Patience + dedication here will work.
Trust me.

Recent times have seen a surge of SaaS IPOs. In 2014 there were several high-profile floatations: Zendesk, Hubspot, New Relic, and Hortonworks. At the start of 2015, Box completed its initial public offering and raised $175 million in the process; its stock jumped 66% on the first day of trading.
All of these companies owe their very existence to Salesforce.com, which paved the way for all Software-as-a-Service companies. I had the good fortune of joining Salesforce before its IPO in 2004; the company has since grown into a global powerhouse. The success of Salesforce ushered in an era of enterprise software based on a new business model — software delivered via the Internet and licensed on a subscription basis.
The software industry has changed forever because of the vision of Marc Benioff and the other co-founders of Salesforce.com: Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez. Working alongside them will forever be a highlight in my career.
Entrepreneurs today should study the tactics Salesforce used to transform from scrappy upstart into an industry bellwether. Salesforce became a great company — and was able to IPO — by applying the following 7 principles:
You’ll observe many of these same traits in today’s successful SaaS companies.
Although there’s no guarantee that your SaaS company will IPO, if you adhere to these 7 principles you’ll tilt the odds in your favor!
To have a viable business, all of the following should hold true (and if they do, your startup has the potential to take-off like a rocket ship!):
If you can succinctly state the value of your product, many things will follow. The market will easily understand what you have to offer. Your message will resonate with potential customers because they can easily comprehend and remember it. Providing a simple statement of your solution belies its technical complexity and puts customers at ease (while putting competitors on their back foot). You’ll also be able to market and sell your offering to your customers and to potential employees.
The Salesforce product at the outset was strictly for Salesforce Automation (SFA), with aspirations to become a full-lifecycle Customer Relationship Management (CRM) suite. That’s a lot to comprehend for potential customers and employees alike.
Simply stated, Benioff’s vision was to make Enterprise Software as simple to use as Amazon.com. As you can see, Salesforce closely resembled its inspiration (and incorporated a pithy phrase to describe its value to customers).
Building a startup and scaling it into a lasting company is no small feat. To accomplish this, entrepreneurs need a team as passionate about the company as they are.
In an interview from 2000, venture capitalist John Doerr made the following statements about startup hiring which highlighted the differences between “mercenaries” and “missionaries”:
Mercenaries think opportunistically; missionaries think strategically. Mercenaries go for the sprint; missionaries go for the marathon. Mercenaries focus on their competitors and financial statements; missionaries focus on their customers and value statements. Mercenaries are bosses of wolf packs; missionaries are mentors or coaches of teams. Mercenaries worry about entitlements; missionaries are obsessed with making a contribution. Mercenaries are motivated by the lust for making money; missionaries, while recognizing the importance of money, are fundamentally driven by the desire to make meaning.
A startup with the vision to change the world will attract missionaries who strive for a goal loftier than a large pay packet. Not all startups can provide this type of motivation to their employees; companies that do will assemble a team motivated by purpose rather than profits.
Salesforce had a truly aspirational goal: to change the way enterprise software is delivered. Benioff was a visionary who recognized in 1999 that the Internet could be used to deliver Software-as-a-Service. This notion was preposterous at the time. Companies were reluctant to store their data on 3rd party servers. CIOs had an array of concerns about SaaS; they doubted a web-based application could compete with packaged software with respect to security, performance, functionality and control.
In the face of this, Benioff extolled the virtues of “No Software.” He stated that companies should be able to rent software over the Internet, a proposition that was much cheaper than the hefty expense of an “on-premise” Enterprise Software purchase.
Every entrepreneur wants a team fervent about the company mission. Truly great companies are those that instill passion and devotion among their employees.
In the case of Salesforce, the cause was “The End Of Software” (as we knew it).
A lasting relationship with customers is important for any business, but it’s absolutely critical for building a successful SaaS company. What might work in the offline world — focusing on a point-in-time transaction and not caring about usefulness and value to the customer — will not create a sustainable SaaS business. Think about the differences between traditional Enterprise Software and the SaaS business model.
Traditional Enterprise Software is…
Contrast this with the SaaS model…
In the SaaS realm, a “sale” is just the beginning of a long-term relationship with the customer. SaaS providers should be attuned to the needs of their customers; if their service doesn’t provide value, the customer won’t renew (much less expand) the lease.
SaaS providers are landlords, leasing access to functionality and data storage on their servers. Being a successful “landlord” (SaaS company) means having happy “tenants” (customers). Salesforce shared this apartment analogy on its website, in marketing campaigns, and at user conferences until the term “muti-tenant” became associated with SaaS. (We also filed many patents on our multi-tenant database architecture.)
Benioff understood that SaaS required more than a traditional customer support team and defined a new role in the company: Customer Success Manager (CSM). Access to a CSM would be available to customers willing to invest in a higher-priced plan; in exchange, the CSM would analyze customers’ use of Salesforce and proactively suggest best practices. CSMs would frequently chat with customers and provide “quarterly scorecards” to highlight features or add-ons for the service.
Salesforce also made a point of marketing the success of its customers. Posters emblazoned with images of actual users were placed in the Salesforce corridors; each person was labeled a “Hero” for their adoption of our SaaS. Salesforce even ran print and online ads touting these “Heroes.” Our customers became advocates for the product within their companies and at our user conferences.
Promoting customers as heroes had a side-effect — it created a personal connection among our team. We all felt a duty to the people on those posters.
We wanted them to keep smiling as a result of our software.
You’re an entrepreneur building a SaaS business, and can succinctly state the value of your offering. Your team is motivated by the audacity of your vision and is dedicated to make it a reality. You understand that your startup needs to entice and retain customers (long-term “tenants”) of your service. Given all of this, the following advice will seem counterintuitive:
Don’t build what your customers are asking for.
Your customers may ask for something specific, but you should decide if it’s the right thing to build for their success (and yours).
This example from the early days of Salesforce will illustrate. In the early-2000s, companies were not accustomed to having their corporate data outside of their possession. The idea of an application owned and operated by a 3rd party was anathema. Many potential customers (and investors!) of Salesforce insisted that Benioff provide an “on-premise” version in addition to a SaaS offering.
It took the resolve of Marc, Parker, Dave, and Frank to stay true to their mission — to upend the software industry. They heard what their customers were asking for, but delivered something better. They refused to build an “on-premise” version of their product. And if they had, it would have prevented them from building a platform for SaaS applications.
From 2004 thru 2008, Salesforce laid the groundwork of becoming an application platform. It should be noted that customers didn’t ask for any of these things:
Salesforce assembled the pieces of a platform, and convinced 3rd party developers to build features for the service. If you can replicate this model, you’ll (virtually) scale your product development team by several orders of magnitude!
Build a platform that you know will provide value for the majority of your customers. Listen to their requests and use them to guide, but not dictate, your product roadmap.
You want to ensure customer success and not build what your customer is asking for? I don’t disagree.
The death knell for a SaaS company rings when there’s a problem with customer retention. For a thriving SaaS business, you want to maintain “customers for life.” Your user base should accrue over time, ideally using more features of your service at higher price points as they become more sophisticated.
Your customers won’t stick around if they don’t trust you.
Within 18 months of the Salesforce IPO, we had a trust problem. Our team, our software, and our databases grew in size and complexity. It became difficult for us to deliver features in a timely manner, with the quality that was required for enterprise software.
The performance and uptime of our servers suffered. From December 2005 to February 2006, Salesforce experienced a series of serious outages. Critics argued that the limits of the SaaS delivery model had been reached. The viability of the company was in doubt. Our customers lost trust in us, and we lost trust in ourselves.
In times of crisis, you prove your mettle.
Salesforce co-founder Parker Harris responded to the outages by halting all new feature development. Our team focused on improving the performance and reliability of the service, a process that took months. In the midst of this, Salesforce launched a site called trust.salesforce.com, which displayed the real-time status of its servers. This type of status page is commonplace today; in 2006, this amount of transparency was a novel idea.
To this day you’ll see the following statement on the Salesforce trust site:
Success is built on trust. And trust starts with transparency.
With a SaaS offering, you need to earn your customers’ trust through service reliability and full disclosure when systems are having issues. Like any other utility, your customers expect your service to be nearly always available.
How do you get recognition and respect for your SaaS startup? The odds are stacked against you:
To build a sustainable business, you must answer all these questions. You need to convince customers that SaaS is the best approach. You need to convince industry analysts and press that your startup is a disruptive force. You need to convince customers that your solution is as reliable as established offerings. And you need to convince everyone that your company is introducing a sea change right now, and they don’t want to miss the boat.
Why Saas? Software-as-a-Service allows customers to rent as many or as few licenses as they need. For SaaS customers, there’s no software (or hardware) to buy because the product lives in the cloud. For SaaS providers, there’s a single version of the application to maintain and update; it is far more efficient to support a SaaS application than traditional software. This is an easy story to tell because everybody wins!
To answer the remaining questions of who, what, and why (now), take a page from the Salesforce playbook.
From its earliest days, Benioff spoke of Salesforce as a viable alternative to Microsoft, Siebel Systems, Oracle and SAP. By associating his fledgling startup as a rival to these successful companies, Benioff controlled the conversation. It didn’t matter that all of those companies were far more established than Salesforce. By repeatedly comparing Salesforce to the industry giants, Benioff added a level of credibility to the company.
Analysts and press began covering the scrappy SF startup that had the audacity to challenge the old guard. Salesforce was clearly the underdog, and Benioff took every opportunity to upstage his larger competitors.
One early Salesforce ad campaign declared “The End of Software” and depicted a sleek fighter jet shooting down a red biplane; by implication the jet was Salesforce—and the biplane was Oracle.
Salesforce also employed guerrilla-marketing tactics at a Siebel Systems user conference, staging a mock rally to protest “The End of Software.” The stunt was so convincing that it was covered on the evening news!
Salesforce always provided a continuous stream of strategic press releases. These well-timed announcements kept Salesforce top-of-mind, and could be about a new client win, an industry partnership, or the steady growth rate of its customer base. Emphasizing growth is particularly savvy, because a startup will naturally have a higher growth rate than an established incumbent — by virtue of starting from a much smaller base!
As a startup, you are an underdog in the industry. Embrace it as Salesforce did. It’s an effective way to make a name for your company; you have nothing to lose. And if large competitors react to your tactics, they will have done you a favor — by validating your message!
A startup has several advantages over its competitors: it is nimbler, more creative, and can leverage newer technologies than its staid counterparts. Startups exist to solve existing problems in novel ways.
Entrepreneurs are visionaries; they see a better future and are convinced they can make it come to fruition. This is certainly true at the founding of a startup.
The challenge for entrepreneurs is this: to continually think about their next move. What is the next disruption that can be introduced and how will it shape the company? Entrepreneurship is about risk taking, and making bold statements about “what’s next.”
Benioff is a serial visionary. His ambition didn’t stop at the initial idea for the Salesforce product. Benioff was always thinking about the evolution of Salesforce: from a single-application, to a suite of applications, to a rapid application development platform, to an enterprise collaboration tool, to an application container and database provider.
Each phase of the evolution of Salesforce was shaped by observing the developments of its direct competitors as well as companies in adjacent fields. Product strategy was informed by trends in mobile computing, social networking, and big data. Salesforce learned to acquire companies for core technologies that would advance its ambitions.
Benioff regularly makes bold statements about the future of software, and challenges his team to turn these statements into reality. He’s also fond of the following saying:
Everyone overestimates what can be accomplished in a year, but underestimates what can be accomplished in a decade.
Think of what tomorrow could bring. Make a bold statement about what your company can achieve in 10 years.
Then hop up on your surfboard. Ride the wave. And don’t forget your Hawaiian shirt. Aloha!

If that was the challenge, could you do it? Would you even know where to start? And could you keep your momentum up the whole way, positive that you’re making the best possible choices?
Well, if you can — then you should be teaching this Mastermind instead of me! (Seriously, hit me up on Twitter, I’d love for you to be a workshop teacher for future masterminds).
But for everyone else, getting your product from that hazy, aspirational, trying-to-do-everything-at-once pre-launch place all the way through the nitty-gritty groundwork that leads to growth…
The kind of growth companies like Drift, Hotjar, AutoPilot and InVision have had…
(And yes, I’m name-dropping those companies for a reason — I’ve worked with all of them.)
It’s hard! Hard to do on your own, hard to prioritize, hard to know what will work (and what to do when it doesn’t work).
And when you actually do start to grow, it gets harder.
And more confusing. And more expensive, and time-consuming, and soon your entire world is your startup and its crumbling under the pressure…
Breathe.
Successful SaaS startup founders either have experienced a lot of failure already, or they had help. And help is what I’m offering with the Customer Obsession Mastermind, which I’m co-hosting with Marketer / Brander / Copywriter / Story-teller extraordinaire, Alaura Weaver.
In six months, starting January 2019, we’re taking a select group of SaaS founders through everything — EVERYTHING- they need to:
Sure, there are books that tell you how to do all of these things (I’ve read them, they’ve got great ideas). But no book will say “normally this is what people do, but in your situation, you should try this…”
And that’s where a Mastermind group led by consultants top SaaS companies hire to help them grow comes in handy.
If you’re wondering “Okay, Nichole — what qualifies you to lead a Mastermind?”
Here are my bona fides:
I am a SaaS Growth Consultant and Customer Success Evangelist. I’ve been working with communities and top startups for more than 10 years (like Segment, Hotjar, Copy Hackers, Autopilot, Vervoe, Wootric, Appcues, InVision, HubSpot, Drift, ChartMogul, Notion, Product Plan, Growth Hackers, Product Hunt… you get the idea), and — outside of these startups — I’ve seen too many early-stage SaaS startups fail for entirely avoidable reasons. Mostly regarding language-market fit and customer success. Which is why this Mastermind is “customer-obsessed,” because your success begins and ends with their success.
Alaura Weaver and I are hand-selecting each member of the group right now — and if you want in, apply NOW! These slots are filling up fast, not everyone who applies will be accepted, because we only want serious SaaS founders who can commit to quite a lot of work.
Yeah, this isn’t one of those Mastermind groups where you just talk at each other once a month, and maybe do a little homework in your spare time. Make a vision board or something.
No.
We push you to succeed. We give you real tasks and deadlines (and a LOT of support!) that you have to do because your business depends on it.
Going from scattered to growth in sixmonths is a big promise, and we aim to keep it.
Intrigued?

https://m.oursky.com/saas-paas-and-iaas-explained-in-one-graphic-d56c3e6f4606?source=search_post---------123,"The Pizza-as-a-Service metaphor was firstly introduced by Albert Barron in 2014 as a visualization of the differences between Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-service (SaaS). At first sight it looks brilliant — but if you look in depth, it falls apart. This diagram wants to illustrate that you need to do less and less, but the items that are listed and increasingly “outsourced” don’t fit the comparison. I’ll look at the services in the original diagram and suggest a better comparison for people who want to choose which services to use.
The basic concept is in each case you get a pizza, though in some cases, you do all of the work; in other cases you have other people do the work for you.
In the diagram, the amount of work you do is in the following order:
Made at home > Take and bake > Pizza delivery > Dining out
Let’s focus on two stages first: if “Traditional On-Premises Deployment = Made at home”, why does “Infrastructure-as-a-Service = Take and bake”? At first glance, it means that the service provider gives you a pre-made pizza, so you can bake it in your own kitchen without making a mess. However, this is not how Infrastructure-as-a-Service differs from Traditional On-Premises Deployment.
Rather than thinking of the consumer doing less and less, let’s think about a product that is increasingly customizable because less is pre-made by the service provider.
By adopting an X-aaS, you don’t need to worry about a certain “X” — be it infrastructure, platform, software or pizza. Instead of forcing the X-aaS model into existing pizza services, I will be dissecting the steps to making an increasingly customized pizza.
Pizza-as-a-Service means you can enjoy a pizza (a fully finished product) upon order. You call the pizza delivery so the pizza is already designed, prepared and baked by somebody else and arrives hot and ready to eat.
In the world of SaaS, we only need to sign up to use the service. We can customize some features, layouts, or users (pizza toppings), but we never need to worry about the deployment and framework the project is used (just like how the service providers put our orders together for us). It also means we can’t choose this brand of cheese over that, or how long they choose to bake it for. If you don’t like their crust, you’ll have to choose another company. So what should be the service layer right below Pizza-as-a-Sevice?
The idea of “take-and-bake” in the original diagram was close, but it misses a few key ideas. The take-and-bake doesn’t allow customization, which is what IaaS and PaaS offer. IaaS and PaaS take care of some backend things you don’t want to deal with, and probably come with API’s, but you choose what you can add.
Instead of a “take-and-bake”, the next level down is more like walking into a kitchen with a ready-to-cook package of ingredients. IaaS and PaaS are when you want to make your own pizza, but you don’t need to worry about buying ingredients, prep work, or having the right tools. You can focus on rolling out the dough, assembling the pre-washed ingredients to your taste and factors like size and thickness before sticking it into someone’s provided oven.
If you use IaaS or PaaS, you can focus on your own business logic and implement your user interface on a reliable platform. The service provider manages the hosting and hardware technologies for you.
This option might not be suitable for every end-user. At least you need some pizza-making skills to turn the dough into a pizza.
Kitchen equipment is infrastructural investment. For engineers, this is where your code runs. It also includes all the infrastructure you need (such as runtime, storage, networking). Without it, your product doesn’t go anywhere, but on the other hand, it doesn’t affect the nature of the product itself.
For a pizza, the next layer below is buying your own ingredients to prepare exactly the pizza you want, with the specific brands you like. But you don’t have to worry about the oven, rolling pin, whether you counter is big enough, or the pizza cutter. Now, you have absolute control on what pizza you are going to make, but maybe the rental kitchen doesn’t have every type of tool you want.
For hard core pizza makers — not only will you want to choose all your pizza ingredients and make it from scratch, you will also want complete control of all the tools in your kitchen: the oven that has the exact settings and capabilities you want, the pizza stone many places don’t have, or let your dough sit overnight at the most optimal corner of your fridge. And finally, you can drizzle that homemade chilli oil on top and savor it fresh out of the oven.
You may think that’s overkill — but in real world, sometimes the effort is necessary if you can’t find a service that will let you customize for that one essential deployment setting, such as a firewall configuration or that specific network setting requirements.
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
On-Premises Deployment
IaaS and PaaS save us a huge amount of preparation work, so we can customize our “pizza“ and bake it fast. The best type of service is whatever suits your product best.
Hope these examples clear up these concepts.

https://medium.com/point-nine-news/invisible-asymptotes-saas-edition-46cdecd5d45c?source=search_post---------386,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
I recently read this fantastic article, Invisible Asymptotes, in which the author explains that one of the key things he was doing at Amazon (in the strategic planning team at the time) was to try to find ahead of time the different factors that could cap their growth. He calls these factors invisible asymptotes: “ceilings that our growth curve would bump its head against if we continued down our current path”. For example, they concluded that an invisible asymptote for them was shipping costs. It was the main friction that would prevent customers from buying more and more. They worked on solving this issue before it arose, and it’s how Amazon Prime was born. Anyway, I highly recommend you to read the whole post as it’s truly fantastic food for thoughts.
Probably like many readers, I tried to think of the invisible asymptotes that applied to my field a.k.a SaaS. To my surprise (and disappointment) I couldn’t come up with so many of them. I’m sharing below three invisible asymptotes that I encountered in SaaS companies. But I would love to read your comments on that topic as I probably missed many of them (that I will include in the post).
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
When they start, most founders initially focus on building a “limited scope” product (in terms of features and what it can do) because they have limited resources. And it sometimes happens that with this “laser focus” product they find a first strong product/market fit and grow fast. The product does one thing, but very well and users love it. In a way, it’s more a “feature” than a “product” (please don’t take it as an insult, I’m not inferring that products with limited scope are inferior).
The “growth ceiling” can appear later, once they have reached the market limit of the particular use case they tackle. Depending on the pain point addressed, it can happen at a few tens of thousands of dollars of revenue or several millions of dollars of revenue.
In general, founders try to solve this problem by either adding more features/building a bigger product or by finding new use cases where they can apply their existing technology.
Adding more feature/building a bigger product. This strategy sounds obvious, but It’s a very tricky and difficult transition to achieve. Evolving from “feature” to “product” is something that can kill a company. Why? Because it’s very hard to integrate new features without breaking an existing product (the “swiss army knife” syndrome), it’s hard to market a different product, it’s hard to keep your existing customer base, and it very often makes you suddenly compete with bigger players (you were the king of your niche, and now you have to face 800 pounds gorillas). If you want to analyze a company that conducted this transition very well, you should look at Intercom’s playbook and how they evolved into a suite of stand-alone products.
Existing technology applied to new use cases. An excellent example of this strategy is Mention (a former #p9family company). The product started as a “Google alert on steroid” monitoring keywords on the web. They used their existing technology to monitor more and more channels such as Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. Again, it sounds easy, but it’s not. Even though they didn’t need to build a new “engine” from scratch, it took a lot of work to adjust properly the product and the marketing to address the needs of different types of users.
This is a very common theme amongst SaaS startups hunting mice and rabbits: they have a great product, grow fast, but finally reach a scale where it becomes too hard to increase user acquisition. When a new customer brings you 20$/month and that you are at several millions of dollars of ARR it’s tough to maintain your growth.
It’s the reason why many SaaS companies initially chasing mice and rabbits, start to hunt deer and elephants, a.k.a go up market. I cover this topic in more details in this post, but adding a new sales model can also kill a company as it impacts not only product, marketing, and sales, but also the company’s internal culture.
And there’s no secret, the companies which successfully achieve this transition are the ones who have founders who manage to set up the right sales organization themselves (you cannot outsource it) and are able to hire an exceptional sales team to make it grow.
What is it?
The last situation I want to cover concerns distribution channel dependency. I already saw early stage-SaaS companies grow nicely to their first couple hundreds of thousands of dollars of ARR mainly because one of the founders was very skilled with a specific acquisition channel (SEO, SEM, content marketing or else). The ceiling appears once they reached the limit of this channel (in terms of acquisition) and have no organic growth in parallel.
How to prevent it
I cover this topic in this post, but a common denominator of many fast-growing SaaS is a robust organic growth complemented by one or two paid distribution channels. What is organic growth? It’s all the new users who are coming, but you don’t know from where :-). It can be because people write about you on the web and it creates a lot of inbound links (“organic” SEO), because your product is shared in many newsletters and you see a lot of users coming from the “email source”, because people recommend your product to their friends and arrive directly on your website (direct source), because when people see you product used by other people they are curious and want to try it (“powered by”) etc…
Unfortunately, there’s no silver bullet to create organic growth. It comes back to your product and to having a strong product/market fit (your product answers a real pain point in an efficient way). If it’s not the case, it can be challenging to maintain your growth once you’ve reached your main “paid” distribution channel limit.

Quick SaaS product lesson …
Offering new “stuff” is relatively easy.
The challenge is continuing to improve on those value streams.
When customers enter into a relationship with a SaaS startup, they do so knowing that things will be rough around the edges at first. The expectation is continuous improvement and innovation. You could consider it as more of a service relationship. Customers — especially those open to adopting new, and relatively untested products — expect you to keep making things better on their behalf (“your team is always innovating!”)
Customer needs and expectations evolve, competitors arrive on the scene, and new technologies become available for building and consuming services. To make matters even tougher, you need “plumbing” that coordinates across these offerings, and that becomes an ongoing concern unto itself as dependencies and complexity multiply. So you’re being hit by multiple angles and it is not easy. This is exactly why startups thrive in dynamic contexts, and why hyper-optimized-for-one-domain enterprises have trouble shifting gears. The fitness landscape is constantly changing, providing opportunities for new players who can sense and exploit the gaps that big players cannot fill.
The temptation early on is to shotgun blast features at different personas, and value streams. This 1) helps close more deals (“hey, we do that!”), 2) gives the outward impression of a dynamic, responsive company, and 3) let’s the startup explore potential pivots. Everything is greenfield, and there is so much to build! This results in a minimally viable product skeleton, but in no way guarantees that you’ll be able to iterate on the distinct value streams from an economic standpoint.
Speed has a cost. A “10x” team is capable of delivering far more initial functionality and complexity than it can reasonably service on an ongoing basis. To adequately move the needle across multiple value streams, you’ll eventually need to hire a multiple of your current headcount (hint: it’s not linear). And this is the basis of the scaling challenging. The important question is: what will your business really need to be when/if it grows up?
When thinking about value streams I focus on the Who, Why, What, and How (see Impact Mapping). For example, at a prior gig we targeted Product Managers, Marketers, Customer Success, and Content Managers/Writers (so four Whos). We addressed multiple “Whys” for some of these personas. Once you got down into the How, things really exploded … with multiple touch-points, “features”, and technologies. What this told me was that down the road we’d need a big team (split into multiple teams) to actual move the needle across the value streams in question.
There’s no right or wrong here, except that the temptation to go broad is strong (especially if you have strong developers and vocal customers). Once you go broad, you start rationalizing a platform or all-in-one solution (because its tough to go narrow once you’ve gone broad). Once you go all-in-one, you have to start thinking big … more capital, bigger team, more value streams, and a more complex sales environment.
So here’s the tip. Even if you are in a project factory / feature factory model at the moment, it is important to think about what your startup might look like in a mission-based model. You’ll need to map out the various value streams (each combination of Who, Why, What, and How), and then gut check what your business would look like if you were adequately moving the needle on those value streams. This is easier than you think. I use my Tweet exercise …
Imagine 3–5 people walking into work each day. They are motivated around a mission. What is their mission in a Tweet? I’m not talking about a high minded, pie in the sky mission statement. I’m talking about something a bit more pedestrian and more actionable. Something like:
You can size these up/down as you see fit, but the general idea is to answer the question “if someone told me N number of people were supporting that business goal, would I be surprised?” This will take some tweaking — sometimes the missions feels a little big, or a little small — but keep iterating until it feels right.
What you find when you do this exercise is that many startups are trying to solve WAY TOO MANY value streams. There’s no way they’ll move that many needles without very considerable scaling up. This is the curse of the MVP idea (when not viewed as a minimally viable experiment). It is way too easy to build a product skeleton of something that will be way bigger than you expected.
So … starting thinking less about features, and more about value streams. It may seem trivial to add another who — oh sure, it seems to work for them TOO! — but with every Who/Why, you’ll open up a new can of worms. Open that can!

プライシングは、多くのSaaSスタートアップが常に頭を抱えるお題の1つだ。その理由は、大きく2つあると思う。1つ目は、スタートアップが狙うような、新しい市場の場合、得られる情報が限られている中、価格という具体的な数字に落とす必要があるため。2つ目は、特に初期プライシングは確立された方法論がないためだ。（いわゆるコモディティ領域で行われているような需要-供給曲線で決められるモノがない）
そのため、私も起業家の方とプライシングについてよく議論させてもらうのだが、その時に一番よく聞かれるのが、「このサービスは、いくらにするのが適切なのか？」という質問だ。確かに聞きたい気持ちもわかるし、私も起業家だったら人に意見を求めたくなる。ただ、プライシングをする前に、集めるべき情報や会社の戦略が固まっていないと、あまり有益な意見は誰からも出てこないし、求める答えには近づけられないのではないか、と思う。
そこで今回は、SaaSのプライシングを考える上で、私が思う覚えておくべき前提の考えと思考プロセスについて紹介させて頂く。（この考え方は、尊敬するRed PointのTomasz Tunguz氏の考え方をベースに、型にしているものなので、原文も読んで頂きたい。）
まずは本題に入る前に、私が考えるプライシングをする上で覚えてほしい前提の考えを列挙する 。
プライシングは戦略とおなじで100％正しいものは存在しない。戦略目標と連動させて仮説→検証を繰り返すことで、企業を成長させていく上での重要な武器と言える。
以降で、特にSaaSにおいて、プライシングを武器に磨きこむ上での4つの思考プロセスについて、紹介する。
私がSaaSのプライシングを考える上での思考プロセスは、以下の通りだ。
ちなみに、この4つのプロセスは常に行ったり来たりさせ、仮説を作った後も、このサイクルを回していく。続いて、各プロセスで集めた方が良い情報や経営チームで固めるべき自社の方針について紹介する。
まず最初は「何を目的に、誰に売るのか？」をしっかり見極めるために、狙っている顧客セグメントと、そもそも追求したい経営指標が合っているのか、きちんと確認して、アラインさせることが重要だ。ここでいう顧客セグメントは、企業規模(エンタープライズ vs. SMB)、業界など、見えている範囲で始めるのが良い。すでに課金をしているならば、簡単に統計でやられているクラスター分析をおこなってみるのも一つの手法だ。
プライシングに向けての経営指標については、プライシングの権威Madhavan氏の本によると、大きく3タイプある。
A. 売上成長率：短期での売上成長の最大化
B2B SaaSの初期ステージでよく用いられる。顧客ターゲットはいわゆるSMB(中小規模）をターゲットにするケースが多く、顧客のWillingness to pay(支払い意欲)に大きな差が作れていない時に重視される
B. 市場シェア：市場浸透の加速化
主に小規模をターゲットに、市場シェアを広げる際に指標にされる。特に半コモディティ領域のSaaSでよく見られるが、結果として低価格戦略になるケースが多い。この場合、顧客の導入ハードルが下げて一気に拡大し、市場シェアを獲得したのち、大企業側に舵を切る戦略方針になる。大手SaaS企業では、Slack、New Relic、Expensifyなどが有名な例である。
C. 利益：利益の最大化
アーリー以降で、主に大企業を中心にターゲットにした場合にたまに使われる指標で、SaaS企業ではあまり一般的ではない。ただ有名企業での例外として、Oracle(データベース)やHRTechのWorkdayがこれにあたる。
マーケティングの4Pで中で一番忘れ去られる要素だが、プライシングにおいては重要だ。なぜなら、価格はブランドのシグナリングの意味合いもあるからだ。そのため、顧客から”どう見られたいのか？”をあらかじめ決めておくのが良い。（前述の1が”自社視点”だとすると、2のポジショニングは”顧客視点”で引いて見てみることを意味する。）
ポジショニングを考える上では、解決しようとしている顧客の課題がどれだけ深く、導入後にどういう状態(=成功)を期待しているのか、をヒアリングを中心に行う必要がある。その上で、自社と競合のプロダクトがどれだけその顧客の成功に近づけているのか、をしっかり理解していく必要がある。またブランド認知についても同様だ。
SaaSのポジショニングで良くみられる3つのタイプについて紹介する。
A. より機能が充実している（お得ではないが）例. Dropbox、Box
B. お得感がある（機能性は大きな優位性がないが） 例. Zendesk、AirWatch
C. プレミアム感がある（業界をリードするパイオニア）例.Palantir、Workday
プライシングの話なのに、なぜセールス？と思われる方もいるかもしれないが、両者は密接に関係している。理由は3つ。
価格が安いほどサイクルが短く、高いほど長くなる
価格が高いほど、高いセールススキルを持つ直営業、価格が安いほどInside salesのようによりシステマティックに売る仕組みが求められる
言わずもがなSaaSにとってユニットエコノミクスは重要である。その上で、価格はLTVに直接ヒットする上、CACにも上記の通り影響する。
セールスモデルを設定する上では、テスト導入をする際の情報を活用するとよい。ターゲットとする顧客セグメントを獲得するまでにかかった期間やそのセールスプロセスから、セールスにかかる体制/リソース/全体の獲得コストを予想する必要がある。
加えて、代替サービスの有無もセールスサイクルに影響しやすいので知っておきたい。既にオンプレが入っているケースないしは代替サービスが全くないケースは、セールスサイクルは長くなる。（場合によっては、顧客の予算策定のタイミングで1年近く待たされるケースも）一方、一番簡単なのは、代替が人力でのエクセルや代替はあるが、高すぎて導入できていないケース。課題が顕在化しており、セールスサイクルは短くなる。
最後に目的のプライシングだが、一番試行錯誤が必要かつシステマティックにやりにくい部分だ。
まずはプライシングモデルの基礎だが、大きく3つのモデルがある。
AdTechや業務効率化系のSaaSでよく見られるプライシングモデルだが、プロダクトによって生み出された売上効果や削減されたコストインパクトの一部を価格とする手法だ。例えば、SalesforceやExpendifyが代表的な採用例だ。
いわゆるモノづくりの世界で一般的に取り入れられているプライシングモデルで、1製品にかかるトータルコスト+マージンで価格設定する手法だ。SaaSやIaaSでは一般的ではないが、超コモディティ領域では使われることがある。例えば、AWSやTwilio、Herokuが代表例だ。
競合プロダクトがある場合、顧客は価格の妥当性を判断するために必ず比較するため、提供価値やブランドから競合価格をベースに価格を設定する手法だ。一番簡単なこともあり、SaaSでは最も一般的に採用されている。
この3つのモデルがある前提で、まず最初にやるべきは、顧客や競合に関する情報の収集だ。顧客については、業界の利益構造やITに振り分けている予算をあらかじめ知っておくべきだ。これは大体ざっくり価格の上限イメージを持つために必要だ（ただ必ずしも上限ではないが）。利益構造（収益性）を理解するのは、収益性の高い業界(製薬など)ほど、高くプロダクトを売る機会が大きいからだ。また、競合がどの位の価格で提供しているかも、ベンチマーク情報として非常に重要である。
次に、これまでの情報を合わせて、A-Cのの3つのモデルで価格設定、ないしは戦略とマッチしたモデルで価格設定をしてみる。この際に、価格を選ぶ際に、どのくらいのユニットエコノミクスになるのかをモデルで仮説検証する。Value-based pricingの場合、顧客事業へのキャッシュインパクトの概算が必要になってくる。
最後に、最初に戻って1.戦略目標の観点で本当に良いのか、ターゲットとする顧客セグメントにプライシング案を見せてフィードバックを聞きながら、最後は経営チームで最後は腹決めすることが必要となる。
おまけとして、セグメント別プライシングをした後にラフにセグメントの妥当性を確認するTomasz Tunguz氏の統計的手法を紹介する。大学やビジネススクールで統計学を学んだ方はおなじみかもしれないが、t検定(エクセルコマンド TTEST())で簡単にできるので、気軽に試して頂くとよいかと思う。

I’m six months into my SaaS marketing journey. My key thought so far? It’s tough. Tough like diamonds. But also shiny like them. Read on for a tale of challenges, team-work and striving for success.
Take your software product (which is inevitably an ever-evolving beast) and generate leads that ultimately forge a path to creating new, valid customers. That’s pretty much the remit of any SaaS (Software as a Service) marketer. In fact, it’s the remit of any marketer. It’s simple in essence, however, far more complex in practice.
In any software business that produces a product of any complexity, you’ll tend to see a structure/process similar to this:
There’s of course a further process from there, however, it’s not pertinent to this post.
The ‘tip of the spear’ here is the marketing team — if we don’t generate the level of MQLs required, the remainder of the chain starts to creek, and could eventually snap. Ouch. Talk about responsibility.
Marketing needs to add leads to the top of the marketing/sales funnel (info) and then effect them at each stage to push them down through that grinder towards the holy-land of customer conversion.
The number of leads required to drive the sales process will of course vary from business to business and is effected by a huge number of factors, from capacity to qualify them, right through to how many new customers are required to match growth targets and everything else in-between. The key factor in the lead volume question is that age-old question of quantity vs quality.
You can buy them from a number of sources. Throw money at said sources and you’ll get a plentiful level of leads to chuck in the top of that funnel. Yes, I’m totally winning at life. I’m making it rain with leads. Oh, wait.
Sorry. Poor quality leads aren’t leads at all. They’re not MQLs (Marketing Qualified Leads), they’re just leads. Leads that will fail.
These weak leads cause numerous problems including:
I can’t possibly go into every part of this process here, but let me at least provide a basis of how to do that:
When we put that process into place, we should be generating qualified, warm leads that when the BDRs make contact with the human behind that lead, said human is aware of and engaged with the business/product in question. Quality? Check.
It is possible to have quality and quantity and that’s what the team and I are striving for, and making nice headway (even if I do say so myself). There’s one key metric among many others that we’re tracking and that’s Qualified LVR (Lead Velocity Rate). Basically, it looks at the percentage increase of quality leads month-on-month (we track weekly too, however that can be a misnomer). In Q2 we’ve been pushing to increase LVR by 20% month-on-month — May was 66% up on April. Boom.
SaaS God, Jason M. Lemkin frames LVR nicely:
“The Key Metric, you should track and score yourself to, and hold your VP Marketing and marketing team to — Qualified Lead Velocity Rate (LVR), your growth in qualified leads, measure month-over-month, every month. It’s real time, not lagging, and it clearly predicts your future revenues and growth. And it’s more important strategically than your revenue growth this month or this quarter”
Taken from Jason’s post Why Lead Velocity Rate (LVR) Is The Most Important Metric in SaaS.
It goes back to the process I outlined earlier in this post. If you can start from scratch with that process, it’s easier. Startups can do this, however, it’s rare they do for multiple reasons (see section ‘the application of marketing’ here for more on that). Outside of startup-land, you’ll see that process in progress with varying levels of success.
So far in my time at Administrate, I’ve managed to partially work through that process, however, upon starting it was clear that we had to rapidly improve lead-gen and that the time it would take for the team and I to make our mark on the full process couldn’t be afforded, in the meantime at least. We’ve had to reverse and cut up the process somewhat.
It was time to get quick and dirty, with a view to increasing the leads coming in while maintaining a strong level of quality. What did we do?
These steps led to an increase in lead-fl0w, with an acceptable level of quality. Quarter one targets were met and it was time to push things further forward. Caveat — it wasn’t as easy as I’ve made it sound and there are of course still challenges on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
The past six months have been about constant reflection and assessment, both on a personal level (am I doing this well enough? Can I continue to improve things?) and of the whole marketing function and the activity within it. That continual analysis (and taking action on it) is key to marketing and business success. Marc Benioff puts it nicely…
“You must always examine what’s working, evolve your ideas, and change the way you do things”
This assessment has led to a clear vision of what we need to push forward over the rest of this year. That ‘we’ word is key.
I’ve been building out the marketing team and we’ve now got a really great blend of experience, youthful curiosity and the key skills required to build the polished marketing machine we’re striving for.
The marketing team is only one part of a wider team that has to work together and support each other to drive the business forward. The relationship between the marketing and the sales team is vital, and at Administrate I feel it’s a strong one. That’s fair to say for all the components of the company. Maintaining that during a rapid period of growth is no mean-feat.
A big focus on personas and the creation of rafts of content based on those. This is key to improving all areas of the funnel, particularly the middle and bottom stages. Effectively, we’re going through the process I’ve mentioned far too many times already in this rather word-heavy post!
We’re putting measures in place that will far improve our conversion attribution, while improving the chances of conversion via a new trial sign-up and pricing process (not yet launched). I’m also looking to introduce an agile/scrum model to the marketing team, which I will of course, write about here! Alongside all of this, we’re organising our annual conference, LITE. It’s nice to be busy!
Marketing as a profession is always challenging and in the SaaS game, it’s perhaps at a level above other industries. So far, I’ve found it tough, but, I’m feeling more reward than I’ve ever felt before in my near 10 years in marketing and that’s a great thing to be able to say. Here’s to the next six months…

Be the first to respond.
When I joined Lightspeed, a founder of a Series B SaaS startup asked me: “Natalie — since you meet growth stage SaaS companies every day, how many sales reps should I hire to hit my ARR targets?”
I started to get this question fairly often from SaaS founders beginning to hit their stride with a repeatable sales motion. When there is no CFO in place, planning out a sales-driven ARR forecast that takes into account a mix of new and ramped sales reps with various quotas can get difficult.
For founders who want to plan their budget properly as it relates to projections, we suggest modeling ARR based on sales rep productivity because it closely follows how a SaaS business operates. When we dig into SaaS businesses with a repeatable go-to-market, we often create an operating model based on hiring plan forecasts and expected sales rep quota attainment. As investors in numerous scaling SaaS companies (Carta, Seismic, BetterUp, TripActions, Rubrik, to name a few), we found ourselves building this model enough times over that I created a template.
To help founders think through hiring and setting quotas, I built a basic template for which I have shared the link below. It includes three sections: the Bottoms Up Model, SaaS Metrics, and Summary P&L. The most important tab to focus on is the Bottoms Up Model which is driven by inputs such as sales reps, quotas, expected attainment, account growth, and other sales metrics. Below I describe each section of the model and how they interrelate, followed by an Appendix with a step-by-step guide. I’ve shared the link to the spreadsheet for you to download here:
www.dropbox.com
Going from the top row down, start with entering historical and projected headcount of Account Executives (AEs). AEs are direct outbound sales reps with variable ramping schedules and quotas depending on their segment. A segment refers to the target customer base of each type of rep, usually ranging from SMB to Mid Market to Enterprise.
There is also a section to help plan for Inside Sales Reps who answer inbound requests from potential customers. This portion only reflects the ending number of inside sales reps and does not include separate sections for new and churned reps.
In this case, the startup would offer potential customers a trial before committing to a contract and the Inside Sales Rep would manage the customer relationship. We understand this may not be needed for every SaaS startup, but created this section in case it is helpful.
In our model, we use inputs to drive trends of average Annual Contract Value (ACV) per Account over time. As a quick sanity check while working on this section: if a SaaS business is trying to sell more into the large enterprise segment, for example, it should see average ACV increase over time. Conversely, if a SaaS business selling more to the SMB or focusing on self-service (which tend to be smaller accounts), then it should expect ACV to decrease over time.
Our model includes sections for New Accounts and Ending (Total) Accounts which are both calculated, and Cancelled Accounts which are inputs. You may prefer to calculate Cancelled Logos based on an assumption of Logo Churn Rate, but we used inputs for the purposes of this template.
For a SaaS startup that sells to different segments, we include the split of ARR across segments to understand the effectiveness of the go-to-market (GTM) strategy among account types. This section shows New, Expansion, Churn, and Total ARR by Segment and from Trials.
For the inputs in the leftmost column (Column A), the yellow shaded cells are assumptions for annualized Upsell and Churn rates. We recommend using the last year’s historical annualized gross churn and upsell rates as a conservative estimate.
Based on the hiring plan in Section 1A (AE Rep Productivity by Segment), our model also estimates expenses to hire sales reps using average salaries. Note that we did not include commissions in our template as it may vary, but we encourage you to add an additional section to include sales commissions if it applies to your startup.
We include a dashboard of SaaS metrics to show a summary of how all the assumptions in the Bottoms Up Model affect your SaaS metrics. As a founder, you might want to know what SaaS metrics are realistically achievable based on a proposed hiring plan and productivity goals. A tab like this SaaS metrics dashboard will help you benchmark against companies in your industry.
Below the dashboard, you’ll see a section that calculates Sales & Marketing Expense based New Bookings from the Bottoms Up Model divided by Sales Efficiency ratio assumptions. For the purposes of this template, we assume the Sales Efficiency ratio calculated from the Sales & Marketing Expense in the same quarter. The inputs for future projections of sales efficiency should follow the trend of the historical Sales Efficiency ratio.
Since we recognize that companies with longer sales cycles may use Sales & Marketing from the prior quarter to calculate Sales Efficiency ratio, we recommend choosing the best method that fits your startup.
In our model, Revenue is approximated as a % of Ending ARR. If a SaaS company is 1) completing implementation to go live in a consistent window of time across customers and 2) has contract terms for all their customers, Revenue should be approximately proportional to ARR. We recommend that you make assumptions that are based on the trends of historical data and conditions (1) & (2) above.
For R&D, G&A and Other operating expenses, our model assumes a % of Revenue to calculate these line items. A more detailed model might calculate these operating expenses based on ratios of managers and directors, and we encourage readers to extend the template in this regard.
We’ve also included a section for Estimated Cash Flow / (Burn), which references the row for Operating Income (Row 26) in our model. Because software companies tend to have low capital expenditure, Operating Income can be a close approximation for Cash Burn. This is not exact but can be directionally helpful when considering how much money to raise for your growth round or when asked for operating cash burn if your startup is not yet profitable.
If you’re a founder of a SaaS startup in the phase of scaling your go-to-market strategy, you’ve probably thought of parts of this model before. Hopefully, this template for SaaS operating model is a swiss army knife in your toolbox of financial planning for your startup.

In my previous post, I discussed the various methods SaaS companies use to price their products. I also discussed how Value-Based Pricing is an appropriate method to price SaaS products. In this post, I’ll cover the fundamentals of Value-Based Pricing, and also how I used this pricing method at BrowserStack.
Just to quickly recap, Value-Based Pricing enables you to price your product at a fraction of the overall quantifiable value (in $) you deliver to your clients. So if the customer is able to save $100k in costs per month because of your product, you could charge the customer $10k per month for your product if you go by the Value-Based Pricing mechanism. In this case, we decided to price our product at 10% of the value delivered. In general, SaaS companies tend to use the 10X rule where you deliver at least 10X RoI on the customer’s investment in your product.
Let’s now look at the step-by-step process you can follow to create pricing plans using the Value-Based Pricing method.
As a first step, you need to segment your customers into a few logical segments. The objective here is to understand the needs of each of these segments and the value they derive from your product. You will then be able to create pricing plans that suit each of these segments. Generally, SaaS companies tend to have 3 to 5 segments that they build their pricing plans for.
You could segment your customers based on one or more of these parameters — Size of team/company, Industry, Role/Function etc. As an example, if you use Size of company as a parameter to segment your customers, you might end up creating pricing plans for the following segments: Freelancers (1 employee), Startups (2 to 100 employees), SME (100 to 500 employees) and Enterprises (500+ employees).
The value your product delivers to each of these segments will be different. If you have Freelancers and Enterprises among your list of segments, the value that a Freelancer would derive from your product will be completely different from the value that an Enterprise would derive from your product.
In order to understand the value you deliver to each of the segments, you need to invest in customer development. You should ask your customers questions such as how are they solving the problem currently, how much time does it take for them to solve the problem, what are the infrastructure investments they have made to build the solution etc. Through this exercise, you will be able to quantify the value (time saved, money saved or money earned) that each segment is able to derive from your product.
Your pricing should then reflect these differences. The pricing plans for each of the segments will be different in terms of the actual price and/or the product feature set provided for each segment.
If we go by the 10X rule, ideally your product should be priced at X so that the RoI for the customer is 10X. Therefore, if freelancers are able to save $100 per month from your product then your Freelancer plan could be priced at $10 per month. On the other hand, if enterprises are able to make $10k per month because of your product, price your Enterprise plan at $1k per month.
Please note that the 10X rule is just a guideline so that you can be sure you’re not undercharging or overcharging for your product. If the value delivered is $1k per month then it makes no sense to charge $500 per month for the product. And if the value delivered is $1 million per month, then you would be undercharging if you price your product at $500 per month.
The 10X does not necessarily have to be 10X. It could be 8X, 10X, 12X etc. depending on what you feel is right. If the value delivered is $1k per month, then you could choose to price your product anywhere in the range from $80 to $120, as an example.
BrowserStack has a product called Live that enables people to manually test their website across various desktop and mobile browsers. One of BrowserStack’s core segments comprises of manual QA analysts. There could be single or multiple such manual QA analysts in a team based on the size of the company, maturity of the business etc. Therefore, one of the basic pricing plans we wanted to create at BrowserStack was for a manual QA analyst in a product team.
Now let’s look at the value that a customer derives from BrowserStack. The two biggest benefits that BrowserStack provides this QA analyst or the team that the analyst works for are:
To convert these benefits into a quantifiable value, we need to breakdown the time and money savings above into a few line items as below:
Adding these items gives us a total quantifiable savings of $3,500 per year. This means that if the team (or the QA analyst) were to use BrowserStack, it would save them $3,500 per year at the minimum.
So how much should BrowserStack charge such a customer? Going by our 10X rule, this would mean $350 per user per year (or $30 per user per month). This cost estimate of $3,500 per year is rather generous. If we were to be conservative, the estimates could even double to be as high as $7,000 per year, as a result of which BrowserStack could charge even more.
So how much does BrowserStack actually charge? As a matter of fact, pretty close to the numbers above. For its basic plan, BrowserStack charges $348 per user per year (or $29 per user per month).
If you notice the pricing above, you’ll see a new pricing parameter being introduced called per user. In order to have more QA analysts test on BrowserStack, a customer would need to purchase higher plans for more number of users. The pricing scales based on the number of users, which brings us to our next topic on Value Metric.
Value Metric is the basis on which you charge your users. BrowserStack charges its customers on a per user basis. Zendesk charges on a per agent basis. Stripe charges on a per transaction basis. Mailchimp charges on the basis of number of subscribers. WebEngage charges on the basis of monthly active users.
For any pricing plan you create, you should be diligent in your selection of value metric. The value metric you choose should adhere to the principles below:
A Zendesk customer knows the number of agents it has and so it knows which pricing plan to subscribe to. A WebEngage customer knows its number of monthly active users. If WebEngage was to start charging on the basis of number of actions performed by users, would the customers really know the number of actions their users would perform? Probably not. If BrowserStack was to start charging based on the number of minutes used, would the customers be able to estimate at the start of the year, the total number of minutes of testing time they would need on BrowserStack? Probably not.
In all the examples we discussed previously such as Zendesk (per agent), Mailchimp (per subscriber), Stripe (per transaction), BrowserStack (per user), WebEngage (per monthly active users), we can see that the customer is able to understand the value metric easily and is also able to quickly identify a relevant pricing plan that suits their needs.
If a WebEngage customer has been on exponential growth curve with their monthly active user base doubling every few months, the cost of WebEngage for this customer should consequently increase. If a Zendesk customer were to add more agents, they should be required to upgrade their plan. If a BrowserStack customer was to get more QA analysts to test on BrowserStack, they should be required to upgrade their plan.
If your value metric does not scale with usage, then you would end up undercharging your customers massively. Please remember that it’s always easier to increase your revenues from your existing customers than by acquiring new customers.
This concludes my article on how you can create pricing for your SaaS product. I must thank the good folks at PriceIntelligently who have vastly improved my knowledge of pricing for SaaS products through their essays and eBooks.

I’ve noticed that the interfaces of the products I’m using are increasingly invaded by “SaaS enhancers”.
These tools enhance existing SaaS products. It ranges from pure platform plugins such as the Trello one — which will work on Trello only — to services like Clearbit or Grammarly which make their core service available on several existing platforms instead of forcing their users to adopt a new interface.
Here are some thoughts about that trend.
In the past months, I’ve tried less “traditional” SaaS products which ask me to adopt a new interface, but I’ve added plenty SaaS enhancers. I think the major reasons are:
The issue for many SaaS which ask you to use a new interface is that the value they promise does not overcome the frictions cited above. The UX/UI might be better, but often the convenience I’ve built with my existing stack is superior to the value a new product could bring me.
Another aspect that changed in the past couple of months is the rise of “intelligent” enhancers. Platforms plugins are not a new thing, but their approach was mainly focus on improving an existing platform through UI “hacks” or shortcuts. The approach of this new breed of intelligent enhancers is to use the platforms as Trojan horses to deliver their core service and lock the end user.
In my case the best example is Clearbit. I first adopted it as a Google Spreadsheet plugin to enrich data. Then I installed the Gmail plugin for my emails, and I would probably utilize it on other platforms if I needed to. I’m using Clearbit to enhance the tools I’m already using, but it is not platform dependent (It’s me who’s dependent now ;-)).
I call them “intelligent” because many of these tools are not UI “hacks/shortcuts” only but offer a service that brings value based on data (Clearbit) or AI. I’m a Grammarly customer for a couple of weeks and I it’s a fantastic example of the latter.
For me it really tastes like the beginning of the AI-powered workplace.
The first wave of successful SaaS increased people’s productivity by offering prettier and more efficient interfaces (UI/UX) which were also collaborative — people could collaborate on the same tool with shared data. Now that many software categories seem saturated with products based on this model it’s probably time for another wave.
Maybe this second wave will be about increasing people’s productivity thanks to enhancers and not thanks to new interfaces. Ultimately these enhancers will become “invisible.”
The drawback of many SaaS plugins is their platform dependency. If a platform decides to restrict its access to a plugin or to offer a similar feature, these products are doomed. It’s the reason why many plugins are considered as vitamins and not as painkillers.
But since intelligent enhancers build their foundations on data and AI and make their service available on a variety of platforms, it seems that they are potentially more defensible and can be painkillers. One could even see the smart enhancers not as vitamins or painkillers but as viruses, using their host to grow and grow :-)

Ever wondered if a small tweak could 10x your SaaS startup’s growth? Here’s 11 ways for you to get there.
Use round dollar numbers and slip in the number 9 if possible.
Why? Evidence has recently built a case for people preferring to spend more on rounded dollar prices, a counter-intuitive take on the “99c” store. There’s also buzz around the magic of the number 9.
Examples: Cloud9, Nitrous, Intercom.
Place your most expensive plan on the left through to your cheapest on the right.
Why? People who naturally read from left to right will see the value they’re getting relative to your largest plans. The most expensive product will function as price anchor that will influence your customers’ decisions for your other plans.
Examples: Blossom, Help Scout, Baremetrics.
Limit the number of subscriptions, and their differences, your customers can choose from.
Why? People can literally be paralyzed by having to choose. Remove the friction by taking a minimalistic approach to pricing.
Examples: Buffer, Help Scout, Groove.
Position your best plan in the middle.
Why? People tend to go for the product in the middle of a bunch of similar products. In the middle of your pricing page, place the plan you want to perform the best and you think your customers will like the most.
Examples: Kissmetrics, Baremetrics, Briefmetrics.
Provide limited time offers to help convert customers sitting on the fence.
Why? Simply put, “humans place a higher value on an object that is scarce, and a lower value on those that are abundant”. Your customers win by getting your product at a discounted price. You win by getting customers who might have chosen a competitor by a slim margin.
Examples: Cheaper plans for early adopters, one-time discount on annual plans, limited time offers.
Be involved in your community and the white knight that saves your customers from the greedy hands of other organizations.
Why? You can do this by growing communities in your industry (e.g. moderating a Medium publication, running a forum, and so on), blogging about what the current state of the industry is and where it can go, and many more.
Examples: GrowthHackers, Inbound.org, Medium Publications.
Offer a small discount from the get-go.
Why? People tend to opt for (and place higher value on) a small gain upfront over larger gains in the long term.
Examples: Upfront discount on annual plans, 50% discount on your ‘best’ plan.
Minimize the effort it takes to buy your product by pre-filling forms with information your customers have already provided.
Why? There’s a number of factors which can send a user away from your payment form:
Examples: Checkout page best practices.
Create a product that’s unique and pushes the boundaries of your domain.
Why? An item that “stands out like a sore thumb” is more likely to be remembered than other items.
Examples: Slack, Apple, Tesla.
Prominently display companies that use your product, case studies and testimonials on your landing and/or pricing page.
Why? If amazing companies are using your product, people are hardwired to think your product plays a part in that and want to gain the benefits for themselves.
Examples: Blossom Customers, Intercom Customers, Salesforce Customers.
Write your copy with simple-to-understand words that can be read out-loud without stumping the reader mid-sentence.
Why? We have an “innate desire for things we’re already familiar with”. This includes words.
Examples: Slack, Mailchimp, Snapchat.
It’s not rocket science, but it does lead to rocket-ship growth. Try these SaaS startup pricing strategies and let us know what worked and what can be improved!

It was a crisp San Francisco morning. Louis [name changed] was feeling confident, cable car track lines whirring in the background, as he stepped into his local cafe to grab his morning coffee. Strolling down the hill to his software-as-a-service company, the bright sun matches his prospects. The company, built from a three month coding binge in Louis’ tiny south bay apartment, was becoming a real business — in sight of the mythical “unkillable” stage of $10M a year in annually recurring revenue.  Later that week (February 2016), SaaS and technology stocks plunged by more than 30%. Some companies — such as data visualization platform Tableau, saw their values cut in half. This culminated in the mighty Linkedin acquiescing to Microsoft. The next Monday had a cold chill in the air — grimacing, Louis zipped his jacket up against the cold, rushing to his office, his quiet morning routine looking like an oddly distant memory. Along with a day of fog, this chill ushered in Cloud 3.0.
The early innings of cloud were a relatively friendly place for entrepreneurs — following in the wake of the Goliath Salesforce, all scrappy folks had to do was attack an old, underserved market. Or maybe even just build a product for the little companies who had previously been ignored.
The markets reacted very favorably to this new “stickier” revenue — and valuations for high-growth companies were incredibly favorable. The experience was better, faster to set up, and easier to manage than ever before. Products could quickly evolve, improve and delight their customers.  But as Gil Dibner notes — the SaaS revolution’s success may lead to it’s own downfall:
[T]he easy availability and mass adoption of cloud-based (SaaS) technology makes advanced software systems so much easier/cheaper/faster to build that “value” is rapidly bleeding out of the software stack. Yes, software is eating the world, but software’s very ubiquity is starting to threaten the ability to extract value from software. In other words, the ability to write and deploy code is no longer a core value driver.
Jerry Chen of Greylock (as well as Dibner) notes that the traditional moats enterprise technology companies have enjoyed are fading away fast:
In an era of cloud and open source, deep technology attacking hard problems is becoming a shallower moat. The use of open source is making it harder to monetize technology advances while the use of cloud to deliver technology is moving defensibility to different parts of the product. Companies that focus too much on technology without putting it in context of a customer problem will be caught between a rock and a hard place — or as I like to say, “between open source and a cloud place.”
It wasn’t apparent to Louis — or any of the aspiring new entrepreneurs — that even if you found a moat, this new way of doing business had two severe problems: Stacking and Switching costs.
Software empires of old — Oracle, SAP, and others — had a very easy path to accelerate their own growth: turn-key M&A. Buy growing software firms, cut research and development budgets and attach the acquired product to their internal sales force for significant new distribution. Nearly overnight, a $10M a year company could freeze future development, cut its most expensive costs, and become a $40, $50 — even $100M a year business. All this new value realized — just by plugging into the acquirer’s distribution paths.  But now in a SaaS world — software is continually changing and growing, shepherded by the product and engineering teams. The monthly contract value is often far less than the customer acquisition costs (mostly sales and integration). Creating and capturing real value requires up-front investment, and only pays out for happy, long-standing customers.  Thus, for a SaaS acquirer, the team either has to be small enough (and the market large enough) to warrant significant investment, or else have sufficient scale to make a real contribution to the bottom line. Everything else in between is too expensive and too hard to roll up to scale.  Stacking revenue just isn’t as simple as it was in the days of shrink-wrapped software in a box…
SaaS companies enjoy relative ease of on-boarding new customers — no on-prem data to move, easy integration hooks, etc. — but so do their competitors. To make matters worse, there’s even a whole class of SaaS companies built to make switching easier. They emerged from trying to solve their own challenge — attempting to enter a SaaS business and finding a moat: Peter was annoyed. An energetic young fellow — he faced a pretty serious problem: people weren’t even willing to try his company’s analytics product. Even though it was (in 2012) a very immature market — and the current offerings lacked a lot of what customers wanted. Why? It was simply too much time and engineering cost — to migrate from the nascent “incumbent” analytics platforms. So Peter and his team build middleware to make it easy to switch between SaaS providers (maybe then people might try his system). Then, developers around the world found it, and Segment helped usher in a new level of connectivity. (Since this was written, Peter Reinhardt told this story himself to Startup School.)
Not large enough to stack, not worthless (or weak enough) to die
SaaS’s own success is it’s own enemy — the cost and the time to build novel things has fallen significantly. Thus as a software company hits real scale, it’s left in a no man’s land — not large enough to stack, not worthless (or weak enough) to die — but too much competition — from the low end, the high end, from customers cobbling together a series of other tools — to prevent any real growth. When Google releases a full app building tool — that a clever person could use to replace nearly any different app needs their company might have — we know change is in the air.
The next chapter of Cloud software will lead to an explosion of new vendors and offerings. But they won’t quite look the same as before — expect lots of point solutions (run by small teams or even individuals) and software as a delivery for more elaborate (e.g. human-in-the-loop) service. This new way of doing business is still developing rapidly. But here’s a spotting guide to identify this new breed of company in the wild:  Cloud 3.0 Company Differentiators:
Interestingly, Salesforce — who brought us “The Cloud” — may even be the first major window to what next generation companies look like. After all, one could argue the value to a SMB choosing Salesforce (instead of the many ways to manage sales contacts) has become:
We could imagine even faster innovation if only there were a way to establish trust with many remote vendors and workers, each offering the very best point solution in the world. 10 Million “companies” powered by the very best person in the world at their solution. Sounds a little bit like Ethereum and the token-based economy… (More on this another day.)
Some of Louis’ customers started to erode. They love his service, but are wondering if he could reduce the price, since some of them may have trouble raising their next round of funding at the current pace. Besides, the costs of everything — compute, storage, etc. — are all plummeting. Maybe the ailing companies should consider rolling their own version of Louis’ software to cut the monthly bills?   This is the beginning of a post-SaaS world playing out — fewer and fewer companies will break through. Few companies can grow fast enough. The rest…a prolonged stasis, the day to day management of what boils down to a bond — a known flow of future cash with some risk attached to it — just waiting for a buyer…
What value do you uniquely — best in the world — provide?
So to CEOs — what value do you uniquely — best in the world — provide? Do you have the market fit (and the moat) to make the jump in the next stages? What stops the next generation from copying your product and selling it for 1/10th the cost? You and Louis lie awake at night thinking these same things.

Follow me on Twitter for my thoughts on startups and venture capital.
I recently published a post on revenue growth benchmarking for startups. The data is helpful to benchmark whether your company is growing fast enough to be on the path to IPO. The data on its own, however, ignores how much is being spent for that growth. It is easy to grow by spending wildly on sales & marketing (S&M), but growing quickly and efficiently is difficult to accomplish. This follow-up post is focused on helping put into context the revenue growth benchmarking so you can understand how fast your company should be growing… relative to how much you are spending on S&M.
This analysis focuses only on SaaS companies as the consumer dataset was fairly noisy. In order to normalize sales efficiency across all companies, I created a ratio that takes both forward revenue growth and sales & marketing spend into account. While some companies may have different target customers (e.g. enterprise vs SMB), sales cycles, and rep ramp times, this formula still provides a good proxy for efficiency across all companies. The metric is a bit of a spin on ‘magic number’ but uses forward revenue growth which ties to my prior post (more on that in a minute).
Let’s put this formula to the test so you understand the methodology:
I applied this formula against all SaaS companies that have gone public over the last decade. This includes sales efficiency ratios from 96 companies, representing over 275 data points. The chart below allows you to benchmark the sales efficiency of your company against all other SaaS companies that have gone public since 2010. Where does your company stack up?
How to interpret the data: if your company generated $50M in revenue in 2018, a ratio of 2.0x is considered the 90th percentile. This means that if you spent $20M in S&M in 2018 (40% of revenue), you would need to grow by at least 80% growth in 2019 to have 90th percentile efficiency. Similarly, if your company generated $50M in revenue but spent $50M in S&M in 2018 (100% of revenue), you would need to grow by at least 200% growth in 2019 to have 90th percentile efficiency. There’s a higher bar for growth when you spend more on sales and marketing.
The special group of SaaS companies that had 90th percentile efficiency during their growth phase includes, but is not limited to:
It becomes really interesting when we combine the revenue growth benchmarking from my prior post with the sales efficiency benchmarking from above. Below is a map that looks at every SaaS company that has gone public across both dimensions. Because these metrics may move around annually, this is a snapshot of how each company looked in the year prior to its IPO.
To more easily visualize the chart, I shaded the 90th (dark green), 75th (light green), and 50th percentiles (yellow) as well as the bottom 40th percentile (red). The best companies sit above the 50th percentile on both dimensions and are rewarded in the public markets, with double-digit NTM revenue multiples. See below for averages of multiples and market cap at IPO and as of May 10, 2019.
The special group of companies that exhibited both 90th percentile growth and efficiency traded on average at an 8.6x NTM revenue multiple at IPO and currently trade at a whopping ~17x NTM multiple. Each of these companies is worth at least $10B today and combined represent over $250 billion in market value. Conversely, the companies in the bottom 40th percentile on both dimensions traded on average at only 3.4x NTM revenue at IPO. Few of these companies are worth more than $3B today and many have been acquired for modest amounts.
Another way of demonstrating valuation is by plotting each company’s percentile rank before IPO against that company’s NTM revenue multiple at IPO.
For the X-axis, I’m showing the product of both percentiles. For example, a company at the 90th revenue growth percentile and the 80th sales efficiency percentile would be displayed at 72% (.90 * .80). There’s a strong positive correlation. Companies above 75% trade between 6–12x at IPO, companies between 25% and 75% trade at between 2–8x, and those below 25% trade at between 1–6x. There was a stronger correlation between growth and valuation than between sales efficiency and valuation which highlights that public market investors place a stronger emphasis on revenue growth. It’s clear though that success on both dimensions is the holy grail.
Nakul Mandan of Lightspeed wrote a great post discussing how to scale in hyper-growth. He discusses that B2B companies are often constrained by 1) market awareness, 2) sales capacity, 3) deployment and implementation capacity, and 4) capital. In his view, a company can push through these constraints to achieve non-linear growth by either 1) going self-serve or 2) having a large enterprise motion from day one. These go-to-market models create leverage on sales and marketing resources, which is the key to efficient, non-linearity. It is no surprise that the companies in the ~90th percentile on both growth and efficiency fell into one of these two categories:
It goes without saying, but reaching the 90th percentile also requires a strong product, large market, and incredible execution over many years.
Now that you are armed with revenue growth and sales efficiency benchmarking data, see where you stack up. Here are links to two calculators for more precise figures:
Take these benchmarks to your next board meeting and have a discussion on where and how you can improve. Good luck!

https://rocketshipgrowth.com/the-greatest-media-buying-strategy-for-b2b-saas-marketers-c07c8d91f0cb?source=search_post---------304,"This strategy is not ideal for all businesses.
It is designed for aggressive B2B SaaS marketers who want to scale fast and large.
By aggressive, I do not mean unethical or illegal either.
I just mean companies with proven software offers and the cajones to play big.
There are new ways to squeeze out more ROI.
Our digital media buying strategy for B2B SaaS marketers is designed to explode your number of new trials, demos and enterprise leads and leverage new cutting edge digital advertising options for unheard of ROI.
The strategy is built around solid marketing fundamentals, leveraging your highest converting marketing assets to move prospects from the top of your funnel to the bottom of your funnel faster and more cost efficiently.
It starts with something proven to work over and over again for B2B SaaS companies: Branded content [BC]. By combining a single piece of well-researched, data-backed content with conversion copywriting you can be confident that your targeted cold traffic [CT] will convert into signups.
Next is the hottest new trend in retargeting: Content retargeting [RMG]. By using Google Remarketing lists you can use Google remarketing ads to remarket your most engaged website visitors with relevant top-of-funnel [TOFU] lead assets.
We’re seeing massive drops in CPAs from organic blog traffic with remarketing ads going to TOFU lead asset landing pages (instead of a trial or demo) for complex enterprise software offers.
Use content retargeting as a way to recycle your bulk clicks into top of funnel leads if you have a proven marketing automation sequence to turn TOFU leads into new trials, demos and enterprise leads for your SaaS.
Finally, just like you would use your marketing automation sequence to push people through your sales funnel, if you have a large amount of people opt-ing in for your TOFU, you can use FB website custom audiences, FB lookalike audiences, Google remarketing audiences and Google similar audiences to push your visitors through the rest of your sales funnel (middle-of-funnel [MOFU] and bottom-of-funnel [BOFU]).
For the last two years we’ve worked with a handful of the top B2B SaaS companies. We’ve consulted on split tests, media buys, ad networks, audiences, and we’ve seen the results of those tests.
We also use competitive intelligence tools like AdBeat, iSpionage, SimilarWeb, BuzzSumo (etc) to analyze trends of leading B2B SaaS companies and their competitors.
This gives us a lot of data and a lot of experience to draw from.
Based on all of our experience and the data that we’ve seen, we believe this media buying strategy is the strongest digital advertising roll out strategy for aggressive B2B SaaS marketers.
If you’ve ever thought to yourself “Man I just wish I knew what works,” then this article is going to give you some of the biggest insights you’ve seen all year.
To make sure you don’t think I’m just making this up, below I’ve included screenshots showing results from applying this media buying framework to a B2B SaaS clients Google AdWords account…
Did you notice that in the first 90 days leads more than doubled and cost per lead more than halved (while spending $5,000 less ad budget)?
Then in the second 90 days we were able to double the ad budget and scale the number of conversions proportionately.
Listen, I’m not making this stuff up. We have access to an overwhelming amount of data that shows this strategy is a collection of “cream of the crop” digital marketing strategies.
Just look at how the worlds largest B2B SaaS companies like Slack, HubSpot and Intercom grow. They lead with content.
Combine our media buying framework with high converting content and low cost retargeting, and you have a recipe for success.
The best part is, it doesn’t matter if you’re a one man shop or you have a team of internal media buyers, anyone can drive millions of clicks profitably with this strategy (providing you have a decent sales funnel).
Obviously, some customization might be needed based on individual needs, but we felt this is a good template for companies to start with.
In this video I go over how to create a media plan that will be the foundation for your media buying campaign.
In the video above I use 5 contextual targeting options (Software, Celebrities, Blogs, Topics, Competitors). When selecting your own targeting, make sure to test as many of these targeting options as possible:
In this video I go over how to convert cold traffic into sales qualified leads.
In the video above I mention Google Display Network [GDN]. GDN is commonly used by top media buyers because it provides massive traffic at a great CPC with precise targeting options.
However remember this golden rule: this media buying framework can be applied to ANY ad network.
It’s not about which ad network is “the best for B2B SaaS”, it’s about which ad network will reach YOUR B2B SaaS audience at “the most cost efficient scale”.
Here are several ad networks you should be considering to get bulk clicks to your strategic content piece:
In this video I go over how to track your sales for each marketing channel.
In the video above I show you the type of simple reporting you can get when you connect your advertising data to your customer revenue data, so you can see the true ROI of your media buying campaign.
When we start a new media buying campaign at our agency for a SaaS client, one of our main goals is to hit a target CPA that we both agree on (so we are both clear on how our performance will be measured from the start).
Since B2B SaaS companies have a long lifetime customer value, they are often willing to spend a lot to acquire high quality leads.
Because of this, you will often see intense competition with $30+ clicks for high buy intent “software” keywords on Google.
But what if you’re not VC-backed, or you just want to acquire customers more cost efficiently than bidding on expensive Google keywords?
You need to use a proven media buying framework that will scale.
If the media buying framework I outlined looks overwhelming to you, or if you don’t know what ad networks are right for your B2B audience, or if you don’t have the time to learn how to use each of the different ad networks, then you should get our 1-on-1 consulting help.
Our agency has built repeatable, scalable B2B SaaS growth marketing campaigns through leveraging content. We can guide you through the compliance rules and help you scale the campaigns.

https://medium.com/hackernoon/things-i-learned-from-my-saas-projects-private-beta-period-cd69a11d9e58?source=search_post---------138,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
My new SaaS startup https://checklyhq.com was in private beta for about two months. I just moved to “regular” beta! Yay for more betas! The private beta had two goals:
Here’s how it went and what I learned.
I opened up a Mailchimp mail list and added a subscription box to Checkly’s homepage. My goal was to get 💯signups and then start sending invites. 100 does not sound like a lot, but given my budget and timelines I thought it would be enough to give the infrastructure a workout and get enough initial feedback to move to the next stage.
Inviting someone to sign up for a free private beta is vastly different than asking money for it. That’s why I wanted the private beta to be short and sweet, because it does not really tell me anything about the validity of the business.
To get actual signups, I used the following methods. Disclaimer: I had 0.0 social media following or any audience to speak of. One of my Github projects has 69 stars ✨…
My first strategy was to start blogging about building Checkly. Exactly as I am doing right now. Two blog posts did pretty well: one syndicated through Hackernoon and one via Free Code Camp. This generated by far the best stream of signups. The one about Vue.js did best.
hackernoon.com
!! extra free 1337 growth h4x !! I spend quite some time on the blog posts. Most of ‘m are about a 9 minute read. They come with a lot of custom images and diagrams. They come with a nice colourful hero image, courtesy of my Art History degree. No cheap click bait. Apparently people like that. Shocker. 😱
I arranged to be a speaker at the Vue.js and Node.js meetups here in Berlin. Specifically the Node.js meetup was a big success. Major turnout, lots of interest from developers from the Berlin developer community. Attributing signups is a bit hard, but my gut says the effort was worth it. It was also just fun to do.
!! extra free 1337 growth h4x !! I was very sneaky by either turning a blog post into a talk or vice versa. Two birds with one stone & rather lazy than tired!
I built a spin-off tool from Checkly at https://puppeteersandbox.com. Checkly uses the Puppeteer Node.js framework under the hood to automate browser interactions so most of the infrastructure was already in place. Puppeteer sandbox is like JsFiddle or CodeSandbox, but for Puppeteer Node.js scripts.
I tweeted it around and mentioned it in Slack groups dedicated to this subject. There was even a small pop-up in the corner that would prompt people to sign up for Checkly. It has/had some usage, but I really need to put more effort into it as I’m planning to keep this free tool around for some time.
I’m on the fence about Beta list. I signed up, paid for the most basic plan. I got some traffic and some signups. I’m however a bit skeptical about the value of their traffic.
It seems like their tweets to 50k+ followers fall on dead ears and are just retweeted by bots about 160 times. Exactly for every product with a variance of about 5/10 tweets. I assume the best intentions from Betalist’s side. I did however opt for the refund which they gave without any fuss.
I spent €100 on Twitter ads. I got a ton of impressions and quite some clicks: that’s the easy part. I got about 3 signups.
This is probably due to me being a complete noob with regard to targeting, segmenting, timing, ad copy etc. etc. Props to the Twitter team for making the tools themselves easy to use and quite powerful. This is something I need to revisit at a later stage.
In the end a bit over 200 people signed up. This was more than the 100 I aimed for! Turns out, 200 people signing up for your beta does not mean all 200 actually log in and start using your app. Shocker ! About 110 people actually logged in and did stuff in the app, so about a 50% drop off rate
As I’m “flying solo” I really had the urge to level with someone in the field that has more experience on running a developer-oriented SaaS company. I reached out to TravisCI founder and ex-CEO Mathias Meyer and he gracefully agreed to meet over coffee so I could pick his brain. Mathias was incredibly friendly and supporting and dispensed some great tips about running betas and all kinds of other stuff. Since our chat, Matthias has actively reached out to founders to contact him for advice or just a chat
!! extra free 1337 growth h4x !!: Ask advice from someone in the field. Asking for advice is a very different than trying to sell something. This is why they will probably agree to meet you if you’re not a total psycho.
Prior to launching, I installed the Incoming Feedback widget from Hotjar. The signup email everyone got made explicit mention of this and encouraged people to use that widget for any bugs, wishes, thoughts or whatever.
This worked fantastic. I got 50+ pretty detailed responses. Many users responding included their email address (otherwise it’s anonymous) and I made sure to follow quickly with, whether the response was bug report or a feature suggestion.
What’s nuts is that at least five times users suggested a feature, addition or tweak that I literally had on my to-do list (a simple Trello board) but wasn’t sure about. This helped a lot with reprioritising my roadmap and I even pumped out some tiny additions within days of receiving the feedback.
I’m an engineer so I agonised over so many things before letting people into Checkly. Some things were actually important, but it turns out most things are not. I hate to regurgitate startup lore, but “doing things that don’t scale” and “you’re probably not gonna need that” are very, very true. So, here’s a short list of things I didn’t do:
I’m building an active monitoring solution for dev & ops team at https://checklyhq.com. Sign up for a free 15-day trial. Not sure yet? Try just clapping 👏 below! or…

https://medium.com/hackernoon/practical-guide-to-saas-security-e6b8b76d50a2?source=search_post---------306,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
The average SMB uses more than 54 SaaS products, often leading to SaaS chaos and security exposure. While SaaS can help you get your job done more efficiently, it can also introduce security concerns if not properly locked down. At Blissfully we help hundreds of companies manage this SaaS chaos, and we’ve prepared a simple, practical, and effective guide to improve your organization’s SaaS security.
When it comes to security, your people can be either your best line of defense or your weakest link. It’s key to build your security policies and procedures around people, including taking the time to understand what is intuitive and user-friendly and thus most likely to be adhered to.
Generally speaking, we believe that you should rely more on systems and guardrails than on user actions and training. In other words, take human error out of the equation whenever possible. We also believe it’s best to have fewer vectors, rather than more, and to harden these as much as possible (we’ll explain what this means in more detail below).
Many organizations tackle security on an as-it-comes basis. This can be dangerous, since it often means you aren’t thinking about security until after something bad has happened. Both ad hoc or absent security policies can open you up to a whole world of vulnerabilities. On the other side of the spectrum, some organizations employ arcane security practices (like forcing users to change their passwords at regular intervals for no real reason) that are not user-friendly and are thus often skirted by employees.
Above is an illustration shows a spectrum of SaaS security and access, to help you understand where your organization falls today. Most organizations start off with no policies or systems. In this situation, the onus is on each employee to manage their own security, which means they will typically re-use passwords, share them via insecure spreadsheets, or create other systems that work for them but not for the company.
The best case is to use a single access point to unlock access to company applications, and to create an easy centralized point to enforce human friendly security policies.
The rest of this guide helps get your from wherever you may be on the spectrum, to a blissful state of secure SaaS usage.
In this guide, we’ll share best practices for building a SaaS security stack that is realistic, usable, and focused on the way modern organizations conduct business. In particular, we have focused on the broad range of small to mid-sized businesses, or SMBs. Very small businesses may not be ready to implement some of these controls — and there may not be a need. On the other end of the spectrum, enterprises will find many of these recommendations appropriate, but may need to take things a few steps further to fully mitigate risk. However, on the whole, we think these recommendations will apply to a broad range of business sizes and types and are a great place to start.
Additionally, it’s worth noting that this eBook is focused on organizations who use G Suite. It won’t be as relevant if you operate in Office365, for example. It is also focused more on the security of SaaS operations (vs. securing your core network or production servers.)
If you are using G Suite for your business, the good news is that you already have quite a few security tools and configuration options at your disposal. However, these are no good to you unless they are thoughtfully implemented and automatically enforced. This harkens back to the concept of people-first security.
Here are the areas you should be looking at securing when it comes to your G Suite applications.
The single best thing you can do to improve your organization’s cloud security is to turn on and enforce multi-factor authentication on all products that support it, especially your primary email and collaboration platform (as stated earlier, we recommend G Suite). This greatly reduces the harm that an attacker can do with stolen credentials.
While this may seems like a requirement in today’s age, our data shows that the average company only has 37% of their employees using multi-factor authentication on their main G Suite account. And this number gets even worse for smaller and early-stage companies, where just 22% of employees at companies with less than 50 people have multi-factor authentication enabled.
Another benefit of implementing strong Google-based authentication is that many SaaS products are increasingly supporting Google Single Sign-on, which means that if you enforce MFA for Google, you’ll automatically get those benefits for all apps that use Google SSO.
The Chrome administrator for your organization can set up policies that dictate how employees use their Google accounts on Chrome devices, Android devices, and the Chrome browser. Since these policies are implemented at the account level, they will apply no matter what device the user signs in from. (However, do note that the policies won’t apply to users who are signed in as guests or who use a Google account from outside the organization.) Because these settings can be applied across several devices and the Chrome browser, they are a good way to enforce security without a ton of extra effort from your users or your IT team.
To implement these settings, you’ll first need to turn on Chrome management. Then you can set up user policies, which can be divided up by team to help you apply certain policies to specific groups of users. Policies can include enrollment controls, apps and extensions allowed or required, Chrome web store permissions, Android applications, and a wide range of other security controls. You can view the full list here.
G Suite Team Drives are shared spaces for teams to store and access their files. This feature is included in the Business and Enterprise versions of G Suite. Files in Team Drives belong to the entire team rather than to individuals. This makes life easier if someone leaves your team, because there is no need to transfer document ownership or reset permissions. The files stay put regardless of any individual’s status, so employees can get work done without interruption.
There is also a security benefit to using Team Drives. When you add new members, you can decide whether you want to give them full access to upload, edit, and delete files, or whether you want to restrict them to certain activities at the user level. It is easy to add members, set and change member permissions, and remove members as needed. At Blissfully, we have established a partnership with G Suite and can offer Team Drives to you on a discounted basis. Contact us at sales@blissfully.com for more information and to get set up.
You can’t say your organization is secure unless you know what SaaS products everyone in the organization is using at any given time and can say definitively that they are employing security best practices.
With Blissfully’s SaaS security monitoring, you can access an always up-to-date list of the SaaS in use subscriptions across your company — including “shadow” and unsanctioned applications. You can view full adoption trends for your whole organization, including details by department and products. Plus Blissfully allows you to easily audit what permissions users in your organization are giving to which applications, and get updates on all new additions. This is a crucial layer of security for your SaaS stack. Finally, the ability to manage employee access to your required SaaS products by department, and to consolidate licenses, will give you unprecedented visibility into your SaaS stack.
Today’s IT world is increasingly centered on SaaS. This means it’s critical to enforce secure access to all of your SaaS applications. You can’t risk having ad hoc policies around how employees access SaaS applications, which unfortunately tends to be the status quo.
When companies don’t have policies (or have policies that are hard to comply with), employees tend to either store passwords in an unsecure file or reuse the same password across multiple applications.
The 2016 Verizon DBIR found that 63% of confirmed data breaches leveraged weak, default, or stolen passwords. If you don’t want your organization to be the next victim, it’s time to tighten up your controls. Below are our recommendations for passwords and identity and access management.
Unfortunately, your browser’s built-in password management feature isn’t secure enough to rely on. There have been a number of successful attacks against browser-based password storage, so we don’t recommend that you or your employees use these features. You can and probably should turn off the ability for people in your organization to use Chrome’s password manager, which you can do in the Chrome settings we talked about earlier.
Our recommendation is to use TeamsID, which offers a variety of password management solutions for organizations large and small. In our view, the killer feature of TeamsID is the ability to link it to Google’s SSO. This means that employees don’t have to remember yet another password, and instead you can enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication on G Suite, which in turn will unlock your shared passwords in TeamsID. Bonus: You can use the code “blissfully” to get 10% off when you sign up for TeamsID.
A very solid alternative is LastPass, which has many of the same features. However, it doesn’t have the Google SSO option. It also has some additional configuration challenges, and is not quite as easy to use for team sharing. For example, the onboarding process requires you to set up a temporary password via email, which is not ideal. LastPass does, however, have a few additional workflow and security features (e.g. robust API access and SAML configuration) available to some of the enterprise tiers, which might be valuable depending on your business’s needs.
Either of these options is far better than simply letting your users reuse their passwords across several services, opening you up to credential attacks on a large scale.
As you build out your IT team, and grow past 200 employees, it’s a good idea to start thinking about deploying a unified IAM solution. This can both streamline the end user’s experience and protect the entire organization from security threats. IAM solutions work by authenticating a user once and then unlocking all apps for them, and can offer deep integrations to various company directories.
IAM offerings are a bit like Google Single-Sign On on steroids, offering many more configuration options and deeper integrations. For smaller organizations, this might be overkill, especially if you won’t be able to or need to leverage their killer features like Active Directory sync (smaller, newer companies might not even have this) and SAML integration (typically only available on more expensive, enterprise-level SaaS pricing tiers). But if you are a larger or more advanced organization, it may very well be worth investing in IAM.
Some of the key players in the IAM market today include: Okta, OneLogin, and PING. We recommend Okta for most organizations with more than 200 employees. Okta’s single sign-on product claims to make it 50% faster for users to sign in to applications, as well as reducing IT help desk requests by half. This makes life easier for the folks on your IT and operations teams while meeting “security efficacy” goals. Okta also has real-time security reporting built-in, so you can be alerted anytime something suspicious takes place, affording peace of mind.
In summary, these are our overall recommendations for boosting the security of your team’s SaaS operations.
For most businesses, here is what we recommend:
We hope these security guidelines will help your organization meet the goal of improving SaaS and cloud security by employing practices and standards that are both attainable and effective at protecting you against a variety of risks and threats. The best strategy is the one that can be implemented and maintained, so work to improve your security over time by implementing the best practices outlined in this guide. And if you need a hand implementing this, just let us know!

Top highlight
Since I started to cover the rise of SaaS companies which don’t necessarily want to take the VC path (or cannot), I regularly get asked to share the name of companies providing alternatives to Venture Capital. Clearly, this landscape is starting to evolve fast, and I meet more and more people who are working on new approaches to finance bootstrapped / profitable SaaS companies. As a consequence, I’ve decided to share a list that I will update regularly.
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ By no means this list is an endorsement of any company mentioned⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️. Before selecting any financing option you should definitely get informed as much as possible, conduct proper reference checks (contact companies of their portfolio and ask them to share their experience), understand deeply the financing model offered, and get the advice of competent lawyers.
If you’re wondering why a VC is writing about that topic, the short answer is that I believe the financing environment for startups (especially in SaaS) is evolving fast due to the “commoditization of capital” (more and more capital available). And if you want to stay in business, you need to understand changes instead of fighting them back.
I’ve segmented the list into three stages:
Pre PMF is when you are still at the idea stage or that you have a first product, but little revenue (between 0$ and a couple of $k MRR).
In my opinion this is the most “challenging” stage when it comes to financing your SaaS. Beyond traditional VCs there are still very few options available for entrepreneurs.
Why?
Simply because it’s at that stage that investors take the most financial risks. And when you take a lot of risk, you need to have a potential huge upside to cover it. It’s the reason why the VC system “works” here: investors finance early stage startups knowing that the majority of them will fail, but the losses will be covered by the few companies which succeed. At least it’s what the theory says (in reality most VC funds lose money).
You quickly understand the difficulty to find a balanced model to finance pre PMF bootstrapped SaaS without taking equity: it’ll be hard for investors to cover their losses if they don’t benefit from their big winners.
On that segment, the two main approaches that I see emerging are:
Think of “YC for bootstrapped businesses”. Incubators will provide a bit of money with mentorship and sometimes operational support to help you build your company.
The second approach, which I think will become more common, is to raise with business angels with terms favorable for bootstrapped companies. Instead of raising angel money with “VC terms”, this new model offers the possibility to return the money back to the business angels through revenue distribution. Basically, if your startup turns out to be “non VC compatible”, instead of keeping your business angels in your cap table, you can buy them out through revenue distribution. Ex: “after 3 years we can buy back our equity, at a price guaranteeing you a +40% return on your initial investment” (I’m just throwing random numbers here).
This is definitely a very interesting model which I think will be democratized among business angel networks. The caveat is that you likely need to be an experienced entrepreneur (or proven talent) if you want to raise with these terms. It won’t be easy for a first time entrepreneur to pull this out.
Post PMF means that you are at least at a couple of tens of thousands of dollars MRR. You’ve validated that you have a product that customers are ready to pay for, and that you understand how to sell it.
If you manage to reach that stage, you’ll have more options to finance your company without taking VC money. Let’s be clear, I’m not saying it’s easy. We’re still very early, but most of the new financing vehicles I see in that space are targeting SaaS companies which have found their model and need to finance growth.
In that perspective, the two main alternatives to VC I see emerging are based on:
(Stealth 1–3 are three companies working on that model, but haven’t made it public yet. I’ll update the list when it’s the case.)
This is where things start to get a bit more complicated, but also more interesting. The problem with the traditional VC model, for founders who don’t want to build a unicorn, is that it offers no flexibility: you take money from VCs in exchange of equity with the aim of becoming a huge company that will return this money through an exit (IPO or acquisition). There’s no other path.
Some investors are working on models which offer more flexibility, and take into account the fact that if you end up not building a fast growing unicorn, they can still make money and you can part ways in good terms.
You’ll probably wonder how this is achieved. Well, the current solutions often consist of a mix of equity and revenue distribution. The investor will lend you money that:
From the investor perspective it means that if a company turns out to be a “unicorn type of company” he’ll be able to benefit from a significant upside (since the money they lent is converted into equity). If it’s not the case, they’ll still be able to get their money back, without waiting for an exit to happen, through the revenue generated by the startup.
It sounds really cool on paper, but this model is actually not easy to execute. As with any financing path, you have to be really careful of the conditions you sign. As usual, the devil is in the details.
I probably don’t need to explain to you what debt is. What’s important to understand is that the SaaS model is great for debt financing since there are many metrics on which debt providers can assess the quality of a business, and hence the risk they’ll take.The increasing number of debt providers for SaaS businesses is a sign that the market is mature.
That being said, the majority of debt providers require that you break the $100k MRR threshold before lending you money, and most of them are focused on the US market.
I mentioned in the intro that I often get asked “Hey Clément! Do you have a list of alternatives to VCs to finance my bootstrapped company?”, but I also regularly get asked “How do I sell my SaaS and to whom?” What’s interesting is that even for this situation there seems to be an increasing number of options available for SaaS founders.
The companies I’ve listed above share the same model: they acquire profitable SaaS companies and let their various specialized internal teams (marketing, product, sales) grow them. They basically pool resources for their portfolio of SaaS.
This model has always existed in the form of PE (Private Equity) firms, but what is interesting to notice is that these news players, unlike traditional PE, don’t hesitate to buy much smaller SaaS companies. For instance SureSwift Capital acquires SaaS companies in the tens of thousands of dollar of MRR range.

No SaaS is an island.
It’s hard to find examples of popular SaaS applications that don’t have APIs and integrate with other software. Businesses are using dozens — even hundreds —of cloud services, and they want them to connect with each other.
Because in a digital world of effectively infinite cloud services (just consider how many niche solutions there are in marketing alone), it’s impossible for any one company to build all of the software that a business might want to use.
But making the transition from providing an open application to a full-blown “platform” requires more than that. It’s not just about playing nicely with other kids in the sandbox. It’s about creating a sandbox where the other kids want to come to build their castles, because your backyard is where the awesome neighborhood barbecue party is happening.
Okay, perhaps I’m taking that metaphor too far.
The point is: as a platform, it’s not enough to just technically enable other software companies to integrate with your software, as just another application that they swap limited data with over APIs. That’s table stakes today.
A real platform becomes a true center of gravity within an application ecosystem, a primary “hub” that orchestrates all of that different software and the data flowing through it.
It serves as a significant engine of growth for the developers who build their products on or around that foundation.
And a lovable platform has those developers bursting with enthusiasm about the new business and technical possibilities that it opens up for them.
So what makes a platform “lovable” — particularly to developers who have commercial intent and are looking to sell the products they build? I propose there are 7 essential elements:
1.Attractive business opportunity (e.g., large user base with unmet needs). Platforms are attractive, at least commercially speaking, when they open up access for developers to a large potential market.
That generally means the platform needs to have a large user base with unmet needs or desires that the audience would be willing to pay to fulfill.
Pure platform companies often wrestle with the chicken-and-egg challenge of getting started: to attract developers, they need lots of users; but to attract users, they need lots of apps from developers.
This is one of the reasons why leading applications or multi-application “suites” have the potential to become great platforms. They have already built a large and successful audience of users of their application(s) before they invite developers into that market to augment, extend, and complement their solutions. Two simple but good examples of apps-becoming-platforms that I like are Slack and Trello.
But t making the transition from an application company to platform company isn’t easy. It requires different thinking in your product design, business model, and company culture. Which is why the next six elements make all the difference for truly becoming a lovable platform.
2. Great developer experience — onboarding, development, deployment, etc. Developer experience (DX) is what it’s like for someone to build software that integrates with or sits on top of a platform. Like customer experience (CX), it starts from the very first moment a developer wants to learn about the platform:
As developers then start to build applications for a platform, the factors that effect their experience become:
Just as we think of a buyer’s journey, we can envision a “developer’s journey” too. Dharmesh Shah, CTO of HubSpot, proposed the following framework for four milestones along a developer’s journey that really resonated with me:
The time to each of these milestones — and what the drop-off rate is from one stage to the next — are decent measures of how “good” a platform’s DX is through the lens of actual developers.
Now, if there’s an attractive business opportunity, commercial developers will put up with a relatively poor DX. But they won’t love the platform. That will take its toll on time-to-market of their integrations and the less-quantifiable-but-no-less-real cost of a lack of developer passion for the platform.
Great DX, on the other hand, makes developers eager to work on a particular platform and can spark their interest and imagination — which can pay big dividends in the creativity that developers bring to the platform. It also generates developer-to-developer word-of-mouth that can help a platform prosper and spread.
In a digital world, developers are powerful advocates and influencers.
3. Great customer experience for users adopting products on the platform. Platforms are two-sided markets. For a software platform, the supply side is developers and their applications, and the demand side is customers and their businesses.
A lovable platform is equally delightful for both developers and the developers’ customers.
Think how effortless it is to install an app on an iPhone, for example. Apple has made the customer experience (CX) of discovering, installing, and using third-party apps smooth and enjoyable. (“There’s an app for that.”)
To be lovable for developers, the adoption of products from third-party developers needs to be a wonderful experience for customers. That way, they buy more apps from developers, are happier with those purchases, and retain them longer. They tell their colleagues, and the great flywheel of word-of-mouth marketing begins to churn — which makes developers on the platform more successful.
Great platform CX can’t be tacked on as an after-thought. It must be baked into the customer’s journey — from the very first moment they start learning what’s possible with platform:
While platforms often like to tout the number of third-party applications that are available in their ecosystem, my experience has been that it’s better to favor quality over quantity.
While there’s always incentive to expand the number of apps that integrate with a platform — to give customers more choice and a greater range of capabilities — it’s more important to hold the line on quality control for a great CX.
4. Stable technical and business environment (reliable, scalable, trustworthy). When it comes to platforms, developers prefer stability over volatility. If they invest in building their products and businesses around a platform, they don’t like unpleasant surprises.
One facet of this is technical stability:
But to confidently invest in building their application for a particular platform, developers want more than just technical stability. They also need business stability in their relationship with the platform company — the “rules” of that platform and its market must be fair, transparent, and steady.
To have a lovable platform, developers must trust the platform company:
This was the motivation behind HubSpot’s Pledge to Our Integration Partners that Bradford Coffey published earlier this year. It commits that we’ll strive to be transparent with our integration partners and treat them with the kind of respect we’d want. We will strive to create a level playing field for everyone who builds on our platform.
Are you willing to make a similar pledge to your platform ecosystem?
5. Efficient and fair marketing & sales mechanisms for reaching (new) customers. Commercial developers build products for a platform to sell more of their software. They want access to that large user base with unmet needs.
But even if there’s a need among the platform’s customers, and a developer creates the ideal solution for it, there’s still a matching problem: how do those customers discover the developer’s solution and how does the developer reach those customers? “If you build it, they will come” is generally not a sufficient go-to-market strategy.
A lovable platform efficiently solves that matching problem, providing marketing and sales mechanisms for the two sides to connect and do business together.
A product directory — or “app store,” if customers are able to directly buy products through it — is the most common matching mechanism.
The Apple iOS App Store is the iconic example. Good directories make it easy for customers to browse and search all the solutions available from developers.
Great directories make it easy for customers to also evaluate and compare solutions, to quickly narrow down their options to the products that are the best fit for them.
Good directories solve the search problem — when a customer knows what they’re looking for, they can find it. But what about when a customer doesn’t know what they’re looking for? Perhaps they don’t yet know how to frame their challenge in terms of the right kinds of solutions to search for. Or perhaps they don’t even know what’s possible. That’s the discover problem.
Amazing platforms help customers discover possibilities in their ecosystem:
It’s crucial that these marketing and sales matching mechanisms be “fair.” Products should be featured because they meet an objective set of criteria — which can be transparently explained to developers. The platform company can’t play favorites.
Customers can pick favorites by voting with their wallet, and the platform company can highlight them accordingly. That’s merit based.
But customers are the kingmakers, not the platform company.
One nuance, however, is that care must be taken to prevent the-rich-get-richer dynamics from dominating the ecosystem. If the “most popular” solutions are over-emphasized, they will continue to be the most popular, and it becomes nearly impossible for other developers to break through, regardless of how good they are. This is the reason for “new and notable” sections and “fastest growing this month” charts in many platform directories.
As a platform company, you want to enable partners to compete with each other in your “marketplace” — where each gets to promote the unique benefits of their solution — and let customers pick the ones that are right for them. Because different customers will likely pick different ones. Great platforms are a wellspring of customer choice.
One more note on moving from a directory to an app store: it’s not about the money. Yes, actually selling third-party products through an app store can be a significant source of revenue for a platform company, taking a percentage of all those transactions. Salesforce makes hundreds of millions of dollars from its AppExchange. Apple makes billions of dollars from its App Store. That’s certainly nothing to sneeze at.
But the real value of an app store is eliminating friction between developers and customers. A great app store makes it effortless for customers to buy and install the exact capabilities they want on the platform when they want them. As a result, customers buy more products, which makes them more invested in the platform (read: higher retention), which incentivizes more developers to build products for the platform, which attracts more customers, which attracts more developers — and the amazing flywheel of network effects soars into action.
The enterprise value of those network effects can dramatically eclipse the percentage-of-transactions revenue.
6. Genuinely feel the love from the platform company — it’s part of the culture. The five elements above make for a solid platform environment. But becoming a truly lovable platform requires something more — an emotional connection between the platform company and its developer community.
The best companies genuinely love their customers. They tend to exude that love in everything they do and say, and it’s deeply embedded in the company’s culture. Customers sense that and appreciate it.
That’s the kind of love that a lovable platform must have for its developer ecosystem — and express it in a thousand different ways across product, marketing, sales, and support. Such love is palpable in how the platform company interacts with developers:
Such love also reveals itself in the way the platform company talks about their ecosystem to the rest of the world:
A platform company that loves its developer community keeps the best interests of its developers in mind throughout their business.
Just as you strive to keep the voice-of-the-customer present in your decision-making, a lovable platform company will consistently represent the voice-of-the-developer in its meetings and decision-making too.
“How will this decision effect our developer community? How can we approach it in a way that will have a positive impact on developers?”
While every business must ultimately solve for the customer, solving for the developer isn’t necessarily at odds with that heuristic. In many (most?) instances, it’s possible to do both simply by factoring the voice-of-the-developer into how decisions are framed and implemented.
After all, nurturing a thriving platform ecosystem is one of the best ways you can solve for the customer on a grand scale: it guarantees customers that they will always have great choices to do what they want on your platform, even as they grow and change and technology continues to evolve around their business at a breakneck pace.
7. Sense of shared purpose: being part of a transformative revolution. Finally, the most successful platforms in the world have one more very special ingredient.
The platform company and its developer community are bound together in a shared mission to revolutionize the world in some meaningful way.
The platform is the catalyst and the conduit for that revolution, but the movement is much bigger than the platform company.
Developers join these movements because they believe in the revolution. It stirs their passion and imagination, magnetically drawing them to be a part of it.
Part of that draw is rational entrepreneurism — the opportunity to build a business on the back of “the next big thing.” But the draw is more than a cerebral calculation. It’s a visceral thrill in riding the wave of that next big thing. It’s an inspired belief in a better future.
Developers love a platform that gives them a vision of a future they can believe in — and invites them to play a starring role in the revolution that brings it to life.
However you define our revolution, it can be the linchpin of a lovable platform if:
You offer developers the opportunity to be a part of the revolution and make them a first-class citizen in your revolutionary tribe. It needs to be a collective “our” revolution — you and them, arm-in-arm, marching forward into the future together.
P.S. These are some of the ways we aspire to better serve HubSpot’s developer community on our platform journey. However, I don’t think these principles are unique to HubSpot’s mission. I hope you find them helpful in thinking about your own platform possibilities.

https://nothingventured.rocks/brand-the-only-true-moat-in-saas-24459d8d4eae?source=search_post---------252,"For the past few years, the rhetoric about marketing in SaaS has been something along the lines of ’If it’s not trackable, it shouldn’t be done’ and as a result ‘Traditional methods are fluff and will soon be dead’. I am as guilty as the next tech nerd.
Lately though, it seems there is growing positivity and understanding towards brand building among even the most hardened of digital and growth leaders in the tech space.
Steve Jobs for me defines what good brand building is about better than anyone else:
“Great marketing is about values”.
Values are harder to replicate due to their intangible nature. They also sound fluffy to most boards, VCs, CEOs, CFOs and even some CMOs. But the reality is people are irrational, and younger generations, even in B2B, want to work with companies that stand for something.
With the oceans of how-to content out there, it is easier to run great lead generation campaigns than ever before. With drag and drop tools, It is now easier to build a product than ever before. But it is not easier to build a movement — with consumer and founder scepticism, it is harder. And moats are meant to be hard to build, that’s why they’re moats.
Phorest Salon Software entered the US market about four years ago. Through adwords and Capterra, we started generating leads pretty quickly. But the churn was higher, MRR from our clients there was paltry in comparison to the UK due to price sensitivity, and the type of salon coming in wasn’t a great fit for Phorest (we are best suited to salons with 4+ staff — these salons were smaller). We tweaked spend. We changed channels. We moved pricing. All had some sort of nominal effect, but nothing major.
In Q3 2017, we started investing in brand-building. We partnered with the one of the most prestigious hair care groups (Luxury Brand Partners) in the USA; we worked hard with industry magazines giving them content and data on how salon owners can get their clients back more often, spending more and generating referrals; we sponsored and got speaking slots at elite events with thought leaders and influencers in the industry; we attended more artistic events and got some of the hair artists onto our rapidly growing podcast; we shot video footage of the USA’s leading salons talk about industry issues and how Phorest has helped them tackle that head on.
We were creating a position not just as the best software in the space, which every competitor is also claiming, but we were positioning ourselves as the champion of the independent salon.
It created huge efficiencies in lead quality and sales. It is now taking less than half the leads to generate a sale in just 9 months.
As quality and ‘Phorest fit’ of the leads was improving rapidly, it meant we could invest in a more efficient and scalable demand engine, scaling up our growth efforts and the results were great.
It resulted in twice the number of leads, at twice the conversion rate with a 25% reduction in CPL (cost-per-lead).
Also the fact the salons were a better fit meant that the revenue of new clients were even higher and the adoption of premium packages was higher. MRR in the USA ended up higher than the UK, and churn rates improved month-on-month.
It’s important to note that I am not saying brand alone impacted every area here e.g. we changed commission structures with sales to incentivise selling top contracts more.
Our model is set up for salons with 4+ staff up to 10 branches; we are high touch in terms of onboarding and support and obsessed with churn.
Partnerships, advertising, sponsorship etc. helped position us among the right salons and brought us the salons we were looking for faster, in a more impactful way that is harder to replicate. And they understood the ‘why’ not just the what. We were more than a great, or the best, salon software.
These efforts also changed our proposition from just a better offering as a product to protector of whom we serve. In the SMB SaaS space, where businesses spend much time thinking about how to stay afloat, this has been a critical component in our differentiation.
The SaaS economics of the above impact in Phorest make sense.
Cost of Acquisition is on the rise. Tom Tungunz puts it far more eloquently than I ever could in this post:
“Increasing customer acquisition cost likely has two root causes. The first is competition.
The second is scale. As a company grows, the initial customer acquisition channels become less efficient with saturation. Consequently, the business must develop a portfolio of customer acquisition channels. Typically, each marginal channel has a higher cost of customer acquisition.”
This is even the case on more (typically) organic company-owned channels such as content marketing according to Patrick Campbell in their latest ProfitWell report.
But I believe competition is the most important factor of those mentioned above. In my view…
…there are not really any new effective, noteworthy digital marketing innovations right now. Most SaaS marketers are relying on the same channels they were five years ago. On the contrary though, barriers to creating a SaaS startup have never been lower and capital is aplenty. This means more start-ups and SaaS companies have more money to spend on the same set of channels, driving up CAC.
Regardless of how great your marketing org’s PPC and SEO chops are, it is ultimately an optimisation game. Spend more; tweak the message; A/B test the landing page to death, and hope you get that 3% CPC (cost-per-click) and CPL (cost-per-lead) margin over your competitors. Pray your trial is better or that your BDRs get there first.
In other words, as these channels and skillsets grow in maturity, the gap between those who are incredible at this and those that are good, is becoming increasingly narrow. Great demand gen is important in a fast-growing SaaS company, but that alone is not a moat anymore — not even close. And it rarely builds brand.
If ‘growth marketing’ is your main focus to build a competitive advantage and you want the holy grail of self-serve virality like for example Dropbox, that then is an incredibly risky marketing portfolio long-term (I wrote more about that here) and most fail miserably at it. And again, it is not aligned to building a brand.
Focusing relentlessly on product and lead gen alone means you are easier to replicate. They deliver growth at an early stage but to truly separate yourself from the pack, you can no longer think about just product and offerings and hyper-targeted digital — you need to think about values. A great brand is built on that… it is damn hard to create, but thankfully, even harder to replicate.

Somewhere between prophecy and ignorance there’s a sensible spreadsheet. Here’s how to build it.
This is a guide on how to build an 18–24 month financial plan for an early stage SaaS company with product market fit, some revenues, growing staff and operations and a financing round in the works. Most of the ideas below will apply to non-SaaS startups, too.
I’ve spent some time doing this for myself and more time helping others and answering questions. There’s quite a few best-practice models out there and templates for SaaS specifically or more generic ones for seed stage companies.
All such templates have a common structure: On the leftmost column you have a P&L-like listing of cost items and revenue-driving parameters, and then you have a column for each of the following 18 months or more.
The exact layout is not so important. Just pick one that you like and use it. What I want to focus on is the thought process: how to analyse and understand what drives your business and how to make sensible estimates for the future.
The most useful part of a financial plan is the parameters and models used to calculate the time series for each line. This is where we can see the business logic and underlying assumptions that govern the entire budget. It’s the difference between a plan and a bunch of numbers.
I use parameters and spreadsheet formulas to model the behaviour of different items in the budget over time. Some items are incremented by an absolute amount or a growth percentage every month while in other cases I want this percentage to be gradually decreasing as time goes by. In some cases a budget item is a function of another item in the plan, such as overheads per headcount or infrastructure costs per customer served.
This allows you to easily tweak the parameters when your assumptions change. (e.g. “what if we added a costly feature that would increase our server costs per active user?”)
A little bit of research or actual historical data will get you a set of sensible assumptions. You won’t nail down everything to the decimal, but you can get fairly good estimates for almost all cost items. We will look at how to research and model each kind of item in the next section.
What matters the most is that you think hard about each item in your list and try to understand what shapes its behaviour. Very few things stay flat, especially in a startup that’s supposed to grow 10x within a year or two. Even if your plan is not totally accurate and some things are unknowns, understanding the nature and dynamics of each item budget is the only way to really know your business.
Perhaps the biggest cost of an early-stage startup, so it’s worth being as accurate as possible with it. Make a line for each role and list the total cost-to-company amount for each present and future employee. By introducing future employees at their target hiring date, this also serves as a summary of your hiring plan and makes it easy to play with different scenaria.
It’s tempting to include non-payroll items such as training and benefits in the total cost to company here, but I find that it’s best to list them separately in opex — this way it’s easier to make adjustments on the budget for such items and to track expenditure against them in the future.
To calculate total cost to company it’s best if you use a separate “staffing plan” sheet where you list all roles organised by function including other information like cost breakdowns (gross salary, taxes, national insurance, etc) and ESOP allocations — you’ll need that separately anyway.
In an 18-month plan you may plan salary increases at some point, so don’t forget to adjust for that.
Young SaaS companies are fond of claiming that they do “no marketing at all” but it turns out that even organic traction isn’t exactly free. Chances are you’ll need a budget for marketing collateral, (e.g. paying for a video, printing brochures) going to trade shows, expensing trips or producing great content to attract potential customers. At seed stage you may be doing much of that on a shoestring, with blog content written by the founders and riding the startup conference circuit and social media for cheap publicity. Over time, these will become more expensive as you do them systematically and at scale, so don’t forget them and don’t underestimate them.
Depending on the mix you use, it may be useful to split this into separate items such as field marketing, content and business development. I try to split the items so that I have access to numbers that will help me calculate other things. For example, if I have measured that it takes us X dollars in content production to bring Y number of new customers, it’s useful to have this as a separate category so I can sanity-check the acquisition estimates by the amount we’re spending.
If you use any form of SEM/PPC, this should be a separate category within marketing, because you’ll want to use the amount spent as a parameter for estimating traffic/acquisition volumes.
A lot of things small and large fall under operating expenses. You don’t want to make a long list of trivial items, but you should at least split them up in a few categories so you can see where money goes and also track against these categories when you monitor your actual spend.
This is the cost to deliver and bill the product to the customer. In a SaaS company it will typically include three classes of items:
This category is a common pitfall for early-stage startups because at small scale these costs are trivial, but as usage grows they can grown non-linearly. If you do a good job at developing the right product, average usage per customer will grow in all sorts of ways: storage used, queries, seats, features used, etc. You will probably be adding heavier and more demanding features, need more supporting tools, open up separate services, replicas, etc. Also, for low-price point SaaS, the billing transaction fees can cut into your profit considerably. Do not underestimate this category.
If you have early traction ($500k-$1m ARR) you may be able to calculate an estimate of cost per month per customer based on historical data. Assume it’s going to grow a bit and then make this cost a function of customers. If you don’t have enough data, make an estimate and then multiply this estimate by 3.
For SaaS companies with some kind of freemium or free version (not free trial — I’m talking about having regular customers that don’t pay) you probably need to do a more sophisticated analysis here. Figure out what free customers cost you and how many of them you have per paying customer. Then attach the cost of the free customers to the paying customers. This will also help you evaluate if the free version is helping or hurting your business.
You may have some costs that are expected and planned but do not properly belong in other categories and will not recur with any regularity. For example, we paid an architect and a developer to renovate and decorate an office that we will keep for years to come. Sometimes it’s best to keep such items in a separate line.
Nobody sticks to their budget 100%, much less a startup where things can be wildly unpredictable. Add a budget item for off-budget expenses or excesses. Don’t make the mistake of making this a flat amount per month. Make this a % of your total spend. Experience will tell you how much you tend to deviate, but if you don’t have much experience put at least 5% there. Even big and stable companies deviate by that much on their budgets. The earlier stage you are, the more liberal you should be with this one.
There are two approaches to forecasting growth and revenues:
The top-down approach is to observe your month-on-month % growth trend and assume it will project into the future with diminishing returns. Then work out what this means in dollars. Then assume a growth curve for ARPA (based on historical trends) and work backwards to find the number of active customers it represents, adjust for churn and thus figure out how many new customers per month this forecast requires.
The bottom-up approach is to observe what drives new customer acquisition, in other words how many new customers you get per dollar spent in each channel, estimate how much you’d be spending per channel, add organic/viral multipliers to the result and work upwards to revenues from that. If you have precise and solid metrics for your sales and marketing process, this approach may be the best for you. This usually works great for companies that employ a lot of PPC or lead generation from inside sales forces where the economics can be clearly understood.
I personally prefer to use the top-down method as a primary model and then use any knowledge I have for bottom-up metrics as a way to sanity check and validate that the top-down model target is achievable. You can do the opposite, too. Whatever you do, try to both methods and see what they give you, use the results of one against the other to tune your estimates. You’ll be wrong so the objective here is to be less wrong than using only one method.
Don’t forget to factor in the effect of churn and upgrades into your model. Both are likely to grow if you’re doing a good job. Churn will grow because your product market fit is just now improving and many of your early customers were trigger-happy early adopters or signed up for something different than what you will have in 6 months. Upgrades will grow because improved features, improved adoption and usage will lead to upsells and moving to higher plans.
Even though your upgrades could be larger than churn — resulting in negative churn, a common thing for really good products early in their development — you should track and model these separately. Maybe you’re not losing money but you’re losing customers and you need to be able to calculate how many more new customers you need just to stay stable which affects onboarding capacity and other metrics.
If you don’t have good historical estimates for churn (you can’t have if you haven’t been around for 2–3 years at least) be very conservative with it, i.e. assume higher than your average today and higher than industry average. Churn plagues early stage companies with volatile product market fit, so assume the worst!
Cash flow is not the same as MRR if you have a mix of monthly and annual contracts. Track MRR by spreading annual contracts on a monthly basis, but when it comes to cash, you need to calculate how much you tend to collect up front. In our case the % of annual contracts is relatively stable so I can predict how much cash we will collect on average as a function of the MRR additions.
To calculate runway, remove any non-recurring costs from the denominator, so that you’re estimating roughly on recurring basis. If you have significant one-off costs ahead of you it might be worth writing a formula that takes them our of the numerator in advance.
You’ll want to start fundraising with a few months of runway left, so look at where the company will be like when you have 6 months of runway and honestly think if you’ll be in shape to win the hearts (and money) of investors.
Your budget presumably assumes that you’re spending sizeable amounts on marketing to keep growing fast. This means that your “inflexible” or “maintenance” spend, the amount you’d need to sustain your customer base without growing too fast, is less than your total predicted spend. Knowing how much churn you need to replace and your CAC, you can calculate a reduced total spend that includes just enough marketing to maintain your MRR or grow very slowly.
How is this useful? It gives you the minimum stable burn rate (without axing the company) and thus the maximum runway that you have at any given point in time. If you’d be looking to optimise the timing of a new investment round or hold out during a period where financing is hard, this is maintenance runway is your grace period where you can extend your lifetime without huge sacrifice.
It also serves as a sanity check. A post Series A SaaS company typically uses its financing to grow aggressively, so there should be a point in time about a year from now where you can choose to tone down growth spending but can still survive. If you have an infinite maintenance runway sometime in your planning period, it probably means that you have planned correctly and your balance of spending between marketing and product is reasonable. If you don’t, this may mean that most of your spending is still going into product, in which case you need to decide if you are doing this deliberately.
Now that we have a basic model with initial assumptions, the next step is to debug it. Even if you did a great job with your assumptions, when the variables combine and multiply over a period of 18 months, a slight overdose can take some numbers off the charts. Note that any VC worth his salt will be digging for such issues anyway, so better find them before they do.
To spot such problems we’ll calculate a few “sanity checks” at the bottom. Here’s a few that I use:
If you’re calculating revenue with a bottom-up method (i.e. based on marketing spend and conversion rates) you need to check that you haven’t created completely unreasonable growth rates. Check this analysis on what’s considered a reasonable benchmark for successful SaaS growth rates, and make sure you’re not assuming something off the charts.
If you have a reasonable product-market fit, your average revenue per account should be expected to grow over time. One reason for this is that, presumably, you are improving the product during that time creating better fit with higher-value customers or adding pay-as-you-go features and third-party services. Another reason is that typically churn is higher on cheaper plans in SaaS, with bigger customers sticking around for longer. So, unless you have a situation where you are intentionally going for higher volumes on low-end pricing or you’re fighting a price war with your competitors, your revenue per customer should display some growth over time.
Add up all marketing, sales and customer success costs to calculate your CAC and check that it’s within a reasonable range compared to CLTV. (1/3 of CLTV is considered good) If you’re below $1m ARR, much of your early traction was coming from highly efficient organic channels, but as you scale you’ll have to use more costly channels and waste some money until you become efficient. This means you should expect to see CAC growing higher. If not, maybe your assumptions are wrong, or you’re not pushing for volume as much as you should. (spend more, open up new channels)
Just because a channel yields you customers for a good CAC, doesn’t mean it will scale infinitely. Split up your acquisition estimate to different channels (if you can’t do it bottom-up at least do it top-down by assigning each a % of new customers according to your best estimate today) and see how many customers the model expects for each channel in absolute numbers. Does it make sense? For example, if you’re getting 5 customers a month today by going to conferences, can this be 50 a year from now? Are there enough similar conferences? What about 500?
Some channels may have very large ultimate capacity but increasing your spend in them cannot be done overnight. You can’t go from spending $5k to $500k in adwords in a month, even if you have the money. You can’t hire 10 new salespeople and get results from them in less than a quarter because they need to be trained and they’ll need 10 times as many leads as the one person you have today. Calculate the growth per channel (both % and absolute number) and verify month-by-month that there are no impossible jumps there.
Divide the number of new customer onboarded per month by the number of customer success/support you have on your headcount. Is it reasonable compared to what you do today? Customer service effort grows fast and new people will need to be trained and won’t be as effective when the team grows larger. Make sure you scale headcount and costs in line with revenue growth. What I do is set a number for onboardings/headcount and set our hiring plan such that we always get a new person in the team a couple of months before we hit that limit.
Same as above, but this time we’re looking at total active customers. Look at the % of customers requiring support at any given month so that you can calculate support issue volumes in the future and establish a max number of issues an agent can deal with per month. Check that the ratios stay in safe range throughout your 18-month plan.
Is your marketing budget growing to accommodate your new sales hires? Divide your field marketing spend by the number of sales reps on the field. If it’s too little your sales reps will not be able to do enough. If it’s too much, they won’t be able to spend it and that means your revenue assumptions driven by that marketing figure will not be fulfilled.
What’s the ratio of Engineering staff vs Commercial? In early stage it should be heavily in favour of engineering, but if you’re post $1m ARR and into scaling sales, you should be seeing this ratio flip over. There are data about the evolution of this ratio by year since founding for mature SaaS companies that you can use as a benchmark.
I run some quick ratios like OpEx per head and revenue per head just to get a feel of how reasonable they are. These are numbers that you can compare to other companies (ask a few founders you know) to get a sense if you’re spending too much on OpEx and decide whether this is by choice or just bad planning. Another thing to consider on the per-head items is the number of people and infrastructure you have in place to serve them. Can you have a 20-person company without an office manager? Can you grow to 50 people without some kind of HR?
Similar to the above, run every figure about the business on a per customer basis and try to interpret the results. We pay the bank X dollars per customer? We have a person in marketing for every Y new customers we get a month? How does this compare to others? Does it look strange? Why is it so and what does it mean? What factors affect this? Maybe I should look into those cost items and re-evaluate them.
This is not strictly a ratio, but a way to look at roles and functions line by line in the context of a future scenario and think about how sustainable that future would be.
Here’s how it goes: I pick a moment in time lets say a year from now and go through every person in the company thinking things like “So, now we are generating 5,000 invoices per month including a few dozen problematic cases with frauds and refunds, we’re managing contracts with 7 suppliers, payroll for 40 people, audit closing dates are near in two countries and we’re about to negotiate a new term sheet. This guy is our financial controller and it would be his job to deal with all of this. Is it reasonable to assume he wouldn’t need to have hired an assistant already?” You get the idea. Is your one marketing designer enough to support 4 people in content marketing and $200k/month spend in online marketing campaigns that need creatives, landing pages, etc? Do you need a new product manager now that you have 10 more engineers?
The problem with forecasts is that it’s easy to just scale up the numbers on known models but forget that at 5x or 10x the size, the way we do the work today may not longer be viable. So we’re trying to imagine what the company looks like in the future, and what work would be like, in order to verify that we are not planning an impossible situation.
Even for a product with minimal seasonality, there are some times of the year when things slow down. December for example is almost like a half-month for new business in many SaaS products. There may be special seasonality around your product category on top of the overall seasonality of business customers. Also, if you’re selling B2B, weekends are likely to be off so any per-day calculations you do on ad spending, support staffing, etc will need to take account of that.
Normally, you can make a simplistic model that treats all months as equal and it could work out ok, because some other months are going to peak and the overall result will be similar. But it’s demoralising to miss you target on a month, even if you know that the target was inaccurate in the first place, so adjust if you can.
A less-obvious place to look for seasonality is hiring. You won’t be moving as fast with interviews in early August or Christmas, so if your plan assumes making offers to three people on January 1st, it will probably not play out exactly like that.
Similarly, don’t count on fundraising in August, so make sure your runway doesn’t clash with the holiday schedule of VCs.
Depending on your business and the timing of things, such effects may be trivial to the overall P&L, so feel free to ignore them. But be aware of them because in some cases it matters.
Just because you modelled something, doesn’t mean it’s correct. The purpose of modelling is to make you think about the dynamics that affect every variable in your financial plan, so you can understand what drives it. These in turn allow you to explain your figures in the form of assumptions, which is something you can validate and tweak with research and historical trends.
In other words, you may not be 100% sure that your numbers are correct, but at least you’ll know why they are there and you can debug or fine tune your plan as you learn more about your assumptions.
I think the biggest mistake of inexperienced entrepreneurs is to think that “since we don’t really know, let’s just guess”. There’s a big difference between guesswork and an informed model. Both may be wrong, but the latter can be understood, fixed, and improved.
Some things in your financial plan will be very hard to estimate, and usually these are the things with the larger impact. For this reason, it’s worthless and a distraction to over-analyse small and trivial amounts. Sure, you can make a formula to adjust the cost of free beverages in the office for inflation, or spend a day with the IKEA catalog to figure out exactly how much you’ll spend on office furniture. But is it worth it when a 1% error on the growth curve can throw you off by a half a million?
My friend Christoph Janz has an excellent post about Parkinson’s law of triviality and how to avoid it in startup business plans which I recommend you read.
VCs have this terrible habit of rejecting ambitious plans as unrealistic and then tell you that you’re not ambitious enough when you present them with a more reasonable estimate. Ignore them and make the plan that you think you want to run your company off of.
Don’t reverse engineer your plan to fit the numbers they want to hear — inevitably this approach will create a monster that doesn’t make sense. (and the same VCs who forced the creation of the monstrosity will be eager to point out the inconsistencies it contains, more proof that they are very clever and their MBAs were totally worth it)
Regarding targets, it’s always good to shoot at the edge of the achievable. I.e. a bit higher than you expect, just so slightly higher than the expectation that it will be still achievable and motivational. The financial plan helps you define achievable. You want to make targets for the sales team or for VCs? Jack it up a bit and the go through the sanity checks to verify that it’s not bonkers.

Jul 11, 2019·9 min read
Since Salesforce went public in 2004, there have been almost 70 other pure-play SaaS/cloud companies that have followed them in the public markets, and more and more go out each year. In 2018 alone, which was a banner year for SaaS IPOs, there were 16 high-growth SaaS companies filing S-1s. Many private SaaS companies believe that an IPO and/or reaching $100M in revenue or ARR (annual recurring revenue) is the end state when in reality SaaS companies demonstrate staggering returns in the public markets well beyond $100M in revenue. The United States economy, as well as the global economy, have recovered dramatically since the 2008/2009 Great Recession, but SaaS companies on average have outperformed the broader market by a massive margin. The two “SaaS Crashes” post-Great Recession have occurred in early 2014 and early 2016, and apart from those two time periods, it’s been mostly up and to the right. Given all the recent IPOs and high trading multiples, it’s interesting to look at the historical performance of each public SaaS company.
Most high-growth SaaS businesses (public and private) are valued on a multiple of forward revenue with enterprise value over NTM (next-twelve-months) as a primary metric. What is the right price for a high-growth public SaaS company? The all-time average has been ~8x but more recently the weighted NTM revenue multiple for all high-growth SaaS companies is ~15x, which has been propelled by recent IPOs like Zoom (ZM), CrowdStrike (CRWD), and Slack (WORK) which are trading at high NTM revenue multiples — ZM at 41x, CRWD at 34x and WORK at 28x (as of 9-July-2019). In the recent week or so, the high-growth SaaS weighted multiples have finally eclipsed the Q1'2014 highs.
Given where we’re at in the market cycle — which seems like a 10+ year SaaS bull run — I wanted to dig into the trading history of each pure-play SaaS/cloud IPO and how they have traded from inception → today. For the purposes of this analysis, I left out companies like Microsoft and Adobe and only included high-growth, pure-play SaaS/cloud companies that have gone public in the past 15 years — Salesforce is the first company in this comparable set. I looked at all 70 SaaS companies that have filed S-1’s publicly and tracked the trading history from IPO → today (or when they were acquired). 67 of them made it to trading as AppDynamics, Adaptive Insights, and Qualtrics were acquired days before trading.
Below are logos of all the companies used in this analysis (sorted by IPO date from left to right):
The returns for these 70 or so companies have been extraordinary, particularly for the companies that are still independent. Below is a chart showing the multiple returns over IPO price for the 51 independent companies. The average return is 5.3x, and on average this group of companies has only been trading for only 3.4 years. The IPO month and year are below each ticker.
What about for the 16 companies that have been acquired post-IPO? The average return for those businesses has been 2.8x, lower than the independents. See the chart below which outputs the multiple returns over IPO price for the acquired businesses.
The average return for all 67 pure-play SaaS/cloud companies that have traded publicly is 4.7x from IPO price as of 9-July-2019.
It’s clear that going public is just a milestone for the vast majority of SaaS companies as they accrue significant value in the public markets. With that said, we’re in a bull market and valuation multiples have expanded significantly over the past few years (more on that below), but the numbers are the numbers. In aggregate this group of companies has created ~$640B of cumulative market cap in the past 15 years. Some of these companies have been acquired and their market cap is no longer in this data or has been subsumed by others — for example, Salesforce acquired MuleSoft — but it’s gone from ~$2B in 2004 to $640B+ today, an increase of almost 400x from its initial market cap.
Taking a look at cumulative NTM (next-twelve-months) revenue for this same group, it’s gone from ~$200M to $55B+ today, an increase of over 300x. The number increased almost 3x over the past 3 years alone. Again, this includes acquired companies that have been subsumed by others in the comparable set or taken out completely.
Valuation
I also wanted to dig into the valuation multiples for this same set of companies. Given most SaaS companies are valued on a multiple of forward revenue (NTM or next-twelve-months), EV or enterprise value / NTM revenue multiples are a great way to look at valuations over time. The below chart shows market-cap weighted NTM revenue multiples over the past 15 years along with the average and median. As I mentioned before, we have just eclipsed the historical 2014 highs in the past week or so, which has largely been driven by large and fast-growing companies like Zoom, Slack, and CrowdStrike. The historical average market-cap weighted NTM revenue multiple has been 7.6x.
As I mentioned, the returns of this group of companies over the past 15 years have been massive. The chart below indexes the market cap weighted indexed stock price return for every SaaS/cloud company that has traded publicly (starting from their first close →today or acquisition) which comes out to 1,100%+. For reference, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indexes are also included in the chart. Public SaaS companies have vastly outperformed those indexes and I can’t think of any other asset class of this size to have such high returns over the past 15 years.
There have been some outliers— I went and looked at the individual performance of the companies in this group that had share price returns of ~10x+ from their IPO price — it includes six companies; Shopify, ServiceNow, Paycom, Salesforce, Zendesk, and Twilio. As you can see in the table below, these companies have demonstrated incredible returns and revenue growth rates for sustained periods of time. For example, Salesforce has grown revenue at almost a 40% CAGR for 15+ years. Shopify, the company with the greatest share price return from IPO price, has been growing at a 72% CAGR. Revenue growth has been the largest factor in returns for these businesses.
Taking a deeper look into their respective market caps over time, the below chart has indexed market cap from the first day of trading. Each one of these six companies closed their first day of trading ~$1–3B in market cap and have continued to grow. Salesforce, which has been trading for 15 years is now at ~$120B in market cap. Interestingly, the other five companies are accruing value faster than Salesforce did in their earlier years. It’s not totally fair since Salesforce was trading during the Great Recession (the others came after), but an interesting visual. The month and year each company started trading are in parentheses.
On the indexed stock price returns for these same six companies, all of them are also accruing returns faster than Salesforce did. Salesforce has grown their stock price ~3,500% since their first day’s close of $4.30 in June of 2004, and the more recent public companies in Shopify, ServiceNow, Paycom, Zendesk, and Twilio are growing even faster. The month and year each company started trading are also in parentheses.
Another interesting view of these six companies is looking at their respective share price and NTM revenue multiples over time. I outputted each company’s trading history and plotted share price and NTM revenue multiples for each trading day since they've been public.
Shopify (SHOP)
Shopify’s stock price is up 18.9x since IPO and their multiple has been climbing steadily, and more recently the relationship between their multiple and stock price has been more closely related. They are growing revenue the fastest out of the six companies.
ServiceNow (NOW)
On the other hand, ServiceNow was actually trading at a higher multiple in 2012 than they are today. Their stock price is up 16.6x since IPO. More recently, and similar to Shopify, their multiple and stock price have been more tightly coupled.
Paycom (PAYC)
Paycom’s stock is up 16.0x since IPO and they have grown both their multiple and stock price steadily since they went public in 2014.
Salesforce (CRM)
Salesforce, the longest-trading and up 14.0x from their IPO price, has had a more consistent NTM revenue multiple. They dipped significantly in 2008/2009 but have not reached the 15–20x+ NTM revenue multiple levels of some of the other companies.
Zendesk (ZEN)
Zendesk’s stock price is up 10.4x from their IPO price and similar to ServiceNow, previously traded at a higher multiple than they are at today.
Twilio (TWLO)
Twilio is also similar. Their stock price is up 9.7x from IPO price and was previously trading close to 20x NTM revenue shortly after their IPO and now is ~15x. Their stock price continues to rise ahead of their multiple more recently.
The overall returns from public SaaS companies have been remarkable — the average SaaS company has returned almost 5x from their IPO price. For context, most venture capital funds strive to return 3x+ funds over a 10-year fund lifecycle, whereas if you had a dollar in every SaaS IPO you’d be up 4.7x as of 9-July-2019, on an average timeframe of fewer than 4 years. The past 10 years in particular has been an exceptional time for public SaaS companies in many regards, and we’re now above the 2014 NTM revenue multiple highs — on average investors are paying higher multiples today for SaaS companies than at any other time in public SaaS trading history. At the same time, there are companies like Zoom that are growing revenue 100%+ YoY while profitable, at almost $500M in run-rate revenue. No one knows what will happen at the macroeconomic level over the next few months and years (the current bull market has to slow down at some point), but it’s never been a better time to be a high-growth public SaaS company (or investor!). For those companies that do get public, their investors and employees are being rewarded handsomely and it’s clear that going public isn’t the end goal, but just the beginning.

Top highlight
It’s been a year and a half since I started selling a SaaS product in India’s fastest growing B2B startup, Freshdesk.
It was a big move, when I decided to quit my ‘meh’ job as a software tester in one of the biggest MNCs and join a smaller organisation in the sales division, with no experience. Quite a learning curve, I must say. Right from clearing the interview, to convincing my parents and finally jumping on to the sales floor, it was quite a journey that warrants a few paragraphs to itself.
Once I went live, every week, every day and every hour was an opportunity to know a new person. So why is that a big thing, you ask? Well, it is, when you are an introvert. Yes. Talking to people, strangers especially, striking up a conversation & opening up to them is something that I used to dread. I loved that I had a great chance to push the boundaries of my comfort zone by talking to hundreds of prospects every month. And the best part is, I enjoyed doing this as time flew by.
Now that I think about it, being an introvert was the biggest strengths I had. I was great at observing people, understanding what they’d need & helping them with my product. The sheer joy of watching the money hitting the bank was unparalleled and I realised a few things along the way !
When I started off, my first few calls would be monotonous. It would begin with a customary introduction, a quick roundup of all that my product could do and asking if they had any questions. I then figured this wasn’t working out.
I spent the following weekend, listening to all my recorded calls. Then I realised that, if I were on the other side of the call, I would probably be bored by now. I had to think from the prospect’s perspective. I then started looking into Linkedin profiles of prospects (we are all guilty of some social media stalking ;) ), checking the day’s weather and being more informal on the first call.
It was then about making the entire process more human by letting the prospect know I was there for them and connecting on a personal level rather than just acting as a what-my-product-does recording. The conversations became more interesting, as we discussed vacations, books, food, pets and even air pollution. I also always made it a point to schedule another call in a couple of days to talk a little more about the product. Now, they were ready to listen!
As a sales guy, I’ve had to work with multiple teams and make sure the customers get what they want. There is also the pressure of targets. One thing I learnt early on from my mentors was to ‘Do what is right for the customer’ and not make promises that I’d struggle to keep up with. Old school honesty works big time.
If a certain feature is not available, I accept that frankly and see if I can suggest a workaround. If it’s going to be available in a few months, I tell them. People appreciate that. The way you interact with a customer can sometimes even translate into this ;). An offer
When I started out, I was scared about looking foolish when the customer asked me questions. As time went by, I concentrated more on learning as much as I could about the product and was convinced it was an amazing value-add. This helped me with prospects who were evaluating multiple solutions. I was confident enough to tell them what we were better at and encouraged them to evaluate all their options before making a decision. I made sure I respected competition and never criticised them. I loved how this company compares products.
Not every prospect would convert into a customer immediately. It takes persistence. I tried to build a rapport with them and stay connected constantly. A short appreciative email when the company was in the news or a quick message during festivals always made sure I lingered in their minds. I wanted to make sure I would be the first person they’d email when they are looking for a new vendor.
Being in a company which cares deeply about customer support, I know the importance of time. You have to show customers that you care and that they are your first priority. Nothing speaks volumes like fast responses. There have been times I’ve responded to a critical customer request while having lunch on a Sunday afternoon. And when you get emails like this in return, they certainly do motivate you!
I guess I’m still that introvert who wouldn’t go around and introduce himself to new people. I’m not the typical cheerful, hyper-enthusiastic, charming guy who comes to your mind when you think about a sales guy. But I love being this way. I still have a few butterflies in my stomach that makes me prepare for every call. I still make it a point to read my emails again and again before I send them out. Which is probably a good thing!
When I look at these two years, I love what I’m doing. I’m talking to people around the world, getting to know them and building relationships. I’m helping them support their customers and making the lives of thousands of support executives easier. I’m a part of a stellar team that’s making waves across the world and growing rapidly.
Just two years into my career, there’s nothing more I could have asked for. There’s a long way to go, though :)

Mar 9, 2021·6 min read
I like to think a lot about the future of computing. Along with a small team I run a company called Autocode which launched in July, 2020. One of the opportunities we are focused on is what I refer to as the “Railsification of SaaS,” which I believe is going to be a major driver of both how software is developed and how it is purchased over the next decade. This article is an attempt to summarize some of my thoughts, and I think it’s important to understand a little bit about the the history of software development to paint a better picture of the future.
Every decade since the dawn of the World Wide Web in 1989 there has been at least one paradigm shift in how web software is built and delivered. In the 1990s we saw the mass industrialization of web development with PHP and Apache HTTP Server. In the 2000s, package management and frameworks made development even easier with RubyGems, Ruby on Rails, PyPI and Django. Then, in the 2010s, we saw the cloud take over: distributed and scalable computing became more accessible with the introduction of Docker and Kubernetes for orchestrating server environments and AWS Lambda for a promise of zero-ops, event-driven and on-demand computation.
I believe the one of the transitions we’re likely to see this decade borrows from things we’ve learned from the last three. Quite simply, the “Railsification of SaaS” refers to the inevitable conjugation of easy development, package management and cloud computing as applied specifically to the commercial SaaS ecosystem. It’s the standardization of the way SaaS products and their APIs interact with each other and the web programming environment as a whole.
Before we get to the “Railsification of SaaS,” I think we should talk about the thing that’s already happened, which is the SaaSification of Rails. From late in the 2000s to the early 2010s a few aspiring entrepreneurs began to take note that while the Ruby on Rails ecosystem was superb, there were still things that were frighteningly complex to tackle as a developer. Building an online store was extremely difficult. Adding payments to your app required a relationship with a bank and running through a compliance checklist. Yikes. Adding SMS was nearly impossible.
Companies like Shopify borrowed concepts from the Ruby on Rails ecosystem to offer what is effectively a retail module for the internet. Click a button, create a store, start selling. Customize with code and templates. Though not often thought of in this context, Stripe and Twilio represent the first successful at-scale monetization of the RubyGems, PyPI and NPM ecosystems: “install this gem, pay us, we’ll do the hard stuff.”
All of the innovation unlocked by the Ruby on Rails ecosystem opened up an entirely new realm for commerce online. This SaaSification of Rails is a phenomenon that runs in parallel with the concept of the API economy, the overlap being that package management ecosystems are the primary distribution and integration point for APIs.
In part due to the phenomenon of the SaaSification of Rails, third-party SaaS APIs are now ubiquitous. To build a full commercial offering or even a side project, builders often don’t just open up a development environment, download software, and start coding. A builder today may not start with code at all — maybe they begin an idea with structured data in Airtable. Maybe they start their own online business via Shopify. The ones that do start with code may find themselves quickly wanting to add payments with Stripe. And then they want to make sure their software can send messages to their communication channels — like Slack or Discord. Maybe they want to add authentication to their app easily with Auth0.
While the SaaSification of Rails refers to something that’s already happened — the commercialization of software packages at scale — the Railsification of SaaS refers to what’s next: re-integrating and simplifying the increasing complexity of the SaaS landscape into standard, simple and shareable components and packages. While I can’t possibly enumerate all of the implications of this movement, I can begin to list a few that are already in progressing in parallel with it.
First, the definition of “software developer” is changing, plugging together SaaS apps is becoming a viable — and sought-after — job. PHP developers of the 90s without degrees were sometimes scoffed at; many of those folks are multi-millionaires today. The same thing will happen between the 20s and 30s with tools that emerge this decade.
Second, the viable surface area for innovation in application development is increasing exponentially. Investors in Silicon Valley are calling this the “no-code” or “low-code” movement, but it will invariably converge towards code as the most functionally reproducible and testable medium. You can’t share a Zapier integration universally. You can, however, copy and paste a few lines of JavaScript, Ruby or Python and run it anywhere. There’s not likely to be just one company, framework or new piece of software that wins this decade. There will be a dozen or more.
Third, there is an opportunity to build the RubyGems of SaaS APIs. Anybody who has spent time with APIs outside of Stripe and Twilio has realized that SaaS integrations are mostly godawful. There are existing standards for machine-readable API specifications — OpenAPI, for one — but they are only a fraction of the story and not even well-adhered to. Discord’s API is built around stateful socket connections, while Slack is now mostly a stateless HTTP API. Stripe mostly adheres to a specification congruent with OpenAPI, Shopify is a combination of nonstandard REST and a GraphQL API on top. Authenticating into any of these ecosystems is wildly different.
I mentioned previously that the “Railsification of SaaS” is something we think a lot about at Autocode. Specifically, building the “RubyGems of SaaS APIs,” is extremely interesting to us: our mission is to make people more productive with code. We’re doing this by making the web more programmable.
The summary is that Autocode is built to make it easy to ship code that connects SaaS apps together. We’re a small team of four that has built a web-based IDE, runtime, collaboration and hosting platform for web applications that’s stateless, auto-scaling, and always-on. We have a standard library of APIs to easily manage third-party API dependencies. We even automatically set up webhooks for you when you save your project. We have a CLI and local development tools for anybody that doesn’t want to use our browser-based IDE. Right now we only support building and adding to Autocode’s standard library with Node.js, but more languages are planned in the future.
Some people call Autocode a “low-code” tool, but the reality is that we’re all-code. We just make auth and API management a breeze as you build your apps. We’re extremely fortunate to be supported by Slack, Stripe and the CEOs of GitHub, New Relic, Airtable and Shopify.
The “Railsification of SaaS” is only one shift I think we’re likely to see this decade, there are a lot of companies innovating in the future of computing. I think it’s important to call out some of the ones that are succeeding in the front-end and distributed computing space.
On one hand, companies like Retool are leading the charge on front-end application development by providing better management and abstraction of components for visual development. As a developer, it reminds me of a more business-focused and tactile version of Ionic Framework. Retool is leaning on innovation from the past decade — namely, the React ecosystem — to build a more efficient, streamlined approach to visual tool development on the web.
On the other, there are companies like Repl.it that are leveraging distributed computing technology developed in the 2010s to enable anybody to ship any sort of software they want. While optimized towards educators and students, the team has grand ambitions — and rightfully so, they are empowering an entire generation of young developers to run any sort of server they want having to worry about how to set up Python or manage binaries. They even support BrainF***.
These are two of the faster growing companies thinking about the future of development. But they represent the tip of the iceberg. This whole decade of developer tools is going to introduce an entirely new canvas for software development; at Autocode we like to think about the web itself as a programmable interface. We’d be honored to find our spot among these emerging companies, but as a builder and developer you should think about the tools you can deliver as well. The more innovation the better.
There’s a lot to build. Looking forward to working on it with you.
Keith Horwood is a guy who spends a lot of his time building software. He’s the CEO of Autocode. He’s seen Avengers: Endgame like 20 times and plays Halo when he’s not writing code. You can follow him on Twitter if that’s your thing.

This is a summarized article. You can read the original post in full length (20 min read, 20 screenshots, 3 tables) for free here.
As a founder, there comes a time when you need a business plan, complete with financial forecasts, income statements, and fancy graphs that will impress your investors.
Don’t build it from scratch — use an existing model.
A financial model allows you to draft financial projections easily, fast, and in a professional manner. A great template will also force you to think through all the aspects of your project and make sure you really get the financial logic behind your business.
It can be annoying but trust me, it’s worth your time.
This post compares the top 12 templates of financial models for SaaS startups. I have personally tested each model. I have ranked them on 40+ items along 5 categories. I’ve looked at both spreadsheets and SaaS apps, and both free and paid solutions.
If you are looking at building your SaaS financials, this article is for you.
Here is the methodology I used to build this benchmark.
I compared 40 points across 5 categories: (a) financial statements, (b) analysis capabilities, (c) revenue modeling, (d) cost modeling, (e) extra features. A detailed analysis of each model is available below. In each case, I tested the software/spreadsheet myself.
Granted, it’s not a perfect methodology. One could argue forever about whether cap tables should be included in a startup financial model. But it’s the best I could come up with — without being a finance nerd myself :)
This is a summarized version. You can read the original post in full length (20 min read, 20 screenshots, 3 tables) for free here.
If you want a “good enough” model but are not willing to pay for it, go for Ben Murray’s (model #4) or Chris Janz’s (model #2). Customize them a bit to offset their weaknesses.
See below a side-by-side comparison of the differences between both models.
If you want the best financial model spreadsheet out there and are willing to pay for it, go for Taylor Davidson’s (model #6) or Alexander Jarvis’ (models #7/#8). They are by far the best stuff on the market today.
See below a side-by-side comparison of the differences.
If you want to experience the future of financial modeling, go for Summit (model #11) or Causal (model #12) — while keeping in mind that both are very different.
See below a side-by-side comparison of the differences between both models.
Thanks for reading. Don’t hesitate to leave a question in the comments, I try to reply personally to each one of them.

Top highlight
When I left my VP Marketing role after 5 years in-house, I quickly became overwhelmed with demand from SaaS founders and executives desperate to add senior talent to their team. To tap into the strategic experience of someone who’d weathered the “startup to scale-up” phase before. “We need a strategy!” they’d say. “Our team is great, but they’ve never done this before.” “Marketing isn’t my background; I don’t know what I don’t know.”
It was right around that time that I met Claire, who was experiencing much the same thing as I was, having also just left her in-house Director of Marketing role. So in early 2017, Claire and I launched the Forget The Funnel workshop series, with the goal of chipping away at the big marketing problems we repeatedly saw SaaS companies face: namely, tech’s anti-marketing bias, which often results in an under-estimation of marketing’s value, combined with a severe lack of senior tech marketing talent. Since then, our workshops, training and pro membership have helped 5,000+ marketers and founders get out of the weeds, think more strategically, and directly impact revenue for their companies.
While we’re proud of the impact Forget The Funnel has made, we’re seeing an even more pervasive and detrimental issue needing solving at company after company: namely, a reliance on piecemeal tactics (that worked in gaining early traction) — and a failure (or painful fumbling) to pull the levers required next, to transition out of startup mode and into scalable growth.
You’d think that most startups fail in their first year, but 70% of startups fail between year 2 and 5. Of the ~5,000 startups founded every year, 15–20% raise their Series A investment round. And of those who raise their Series A, less than 10% reach the next stage of investment.
Now, taking investment is far from the only measure of success, but 90% is a massive drop-off, considering Series A investment is all about revenue growth. Why are funded companies stalling out, even after securing traction during the “startup” phase?
We’ve all heard the 20 reasons founders say their startups fail: no market need, ran out of cash, not the right team, competition, etc. But so many of those reasons are preventable, if the root causes that we see so often could be caught and fixed in time:
The scrappiness so crucial to success in a company’s early days, is often a double-edged sword that results in compounding confusion. When the team grows beyond the 30 to 50 mark, everything gets a lot harder, and team members’ responsibilities changes every few months. The product matures, but engagement KPIs are never updated from “daily active users” or “monthly active users,” despite the likely irrelevance of daily or monthly usage to a customer receiving value. The ideal customer shifts (or maybe you never really knew who it was to begin with), but still there’s no reliable customer research for the team to learn from and leverage.
Many of the biggest startup failures in recent history have come from an over-reliance on “top-of-funnel” tactics, while increasing efficiency during activation, retention and expansion go ignored. Expansion revenue should make up 20–30% (or more) of monthly revenue, but for most subscription companies, it’s 10% or less. Acquisition is disproportionately relied on for growth by SaaS C-level execs and founders, who spend nearly 75% of their time on acquisition.
The team may be giving it their all, but results are rarely what you hope they’ll be. There’s a hum of stress in the background as vague targets loom. There’s still plenty of Kool-Aid to go around, but (sometimes unbeknownst to the founders), morale is, well…unclear. Since launching Forget The Funnel, we’ve heard from hundreds of SaaS marketers about what they struggle with: lack of trust from their stakeholders, lack of mentorship, and lack of strategy. Team members who were brought on during the company’s “startup” phase were often hired early in their career, and are now taking on responsibilities they may not have enough experience in or bandwidth for. Tech doesn’t exactly have the best employee retention track record — and there’s a notable exodus among marketers, women and underrepresented groups.
Ignore these problems long enough, and growth starts flat-lining. Revenue goals go unmet. Frustrated hires leave. New features launch to crickets. Pressure mounts to acquire more customers, yesterday.
The SaaS business model lives and dies by customer relationships and loyalty. The fate of your SaaS company depends on your ability to provide a valuable, consistent experience to customers — across their entire journey with your brand — over time. You need to do this more and more cost-effectively as the company grows. Failure to do this = failure to grow.
Moving beyond initial traction to true growth requires:
For fun, let’s do some math. (We’re going to keep it simple by looking at just one traffic source.) Pretend your SaaS company currently acquires new customers via paid marketing at the following rates:
This generates $15,000 in new ARR every month (shown below). Now let’s pretend your goal is to double that amount to $30,000 in new ARR monthly. From a quick comparison, it’s clear that doubling paid acquisition is the least effective way to reach this goal. Not only do improving KPIs further along the customer journey cut acquisition costs in half; they also continue driving improved results indefinitely, whereas paid spend stops working…well, as soon as you stop paying.
But again: moving the needle on metrics like trial signups, new customers, lifetime value, churn, etc. isn’t a game of random guess-and-check. It requires deeply understanding what your customer needs to feel value at each of those touchpoints. It requires operationalizing that customer understanding for your team. And it requires giving your team the tools and skills they need to build high-value (and revenue-generating) experiences for your customers.
Since at least one — and more often several — of these growth levers are neglected by scaling companies, the over-reliance on “top-of-funnel” tactics continues indefinitely, until it eventually does lasting damage to the business. Don’t let this be you.
Companies need to take the big leap from viewing customers through a macro lens (an account holder, a subscriber, a segment, or a persona) to viewing a customer as a single sentient human being — and then operationalizing that view.
— Victor Milligan: CMO, Forrester
For years, my own approach to marketing and company growth has echoed this quote of Victor Milligan’s. But it wasn’t until Claire and I began running Forget The Funnel together that we realized: she holds one piece of the puzzle, and I hold the other.
Claire’s expertise comes from the work she’s done with companies like Wistia, FullStory, Death to the Stock Photo, Calendly, and Edgar, where she’s gathered deep customer insights — then translated those insights into meaningful customer segments / “jobs to be done,” high-converting messaging, and as a result, marketing and customer communication campaigns that convert.
Meanwhile, I’ve been operationalizing customer insights to help high-growth SaaS companies like Appcues and Sprout Social scale. In fact, for the last 10 of my 20 years as a marketer, I’ve worked with and mentored nearly 100 SaaS companies. During my time at Unbounce, I helped grow the company from 15 to nearly 200 employees, Marketing from a founder-run blog to a team of 35, and from $1M to $16M in ARR with no major funding.
Claire brings customer insights chops, and I bring years of growing and supporting strategic teams. So we are now working with SaaS companies together, to help teams avoid the fumbling — and to help startups to scale up.

Stripe has quickly become one of the leading billing solutions on the market, especially preferred by businesses selling Software-as-a-Service. By reading this guide you will understand how to ensure PCI compliance and the best way to build front-end and back-end integration with Stripe.
Any company that stores, transfers, or processes credit card data must adhere to the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. If you integrate with Stripe using their security standards, you will automatically qualify as PCI compliant and they will automatically generate the required Self Assessment Questionaire (SAQ) and Attestation of Compliance which you can download from your compliance dashboard. Stripe recommends adhering to the following items to remain PCI compliant:
Use Checkout, Stripe.js and Elements, or our mobile SDK libraries to collect payment information, which is securely transmitted directly to Stripe without it passing through your servers
Serve your payment pages securely using Transport Layer Security (TLS) so that they make use of HTTPS
Review and validate your account’s PCI compliance annually
When integrating with the Stripe API, the secret keys you use must be stored in a safe place. Avoid storing keys in version control; this could lead to a security breach of customer data and could cause massive problems for your business.
For a SaaS, Stripe Elements is a great tool to create a great checkout page customized to fit your specific use-case. They have pre-built UI components such as credit card input and payment buttons. These handle credit card data while maintaining PCI compliance by sending the data directly to Stripe — without it having to pass through your own servers. They are responsive to screen size, customizable to fit your business’s style, and can be localized to your customers’ preferred language.
Stripe Elements is only a tool to give customers a way to enter payment information. As a SaaS company you still need to develop a front-end solution to handle other functions, such as when a customer upgrades or downgrades to a different subscription plan, cancels their service, or resubscribes.
A Stripe integration on the back-end consists of two parts: an active integration and a reactive integration. Active being direct calls to the Stripe API to perform actions like cancelling a subscription and Indirect being event handlers that respond to events in Stripe such as a credit card payment failing.
The best way to make API calls is to use an official Stripe API library. With this you can start building logic needed to handle all the use-cases you want to cover for your particular SaaS.
Webhooks are API calls that Stripe can send to an endpoint of your choice to alert you when events happen in Stripe. This is most useful for allowing you to respond to payment failures and automatically restricting access to your app when a customer’s credit card is failing.
When building your integration, be mindful of the following:
Stripe does a lot out of the box, but most SaaS companies will need more than just the bare bones. Features such as pricing pages and billing settings pages where customers can manage their own subscriptions.
If you don’t want to spend a lot of resources developing and maintaining your own integration with Stripe, there are Stripe verified partners which can provide a ready-made integration you can drop-into your app. Servicebot makes it easy to connect your SaaS to Stripe without spending time developing by generating embeddable components such as pricing pages, billing management, and check-out pages.
When building a Stripe integration for a SaaS, there are a lot of moving parts that need to be built. Developing a front-end using Stripe Elements and a back-end with one of Stripe’s libraries, and handling events sent by Stripe webhooks are the building blocks of a solid Stripe integration.
If you are looking to minimize development on your SaaS billing solution, you should look at Stripe partners such as Servicebot

Last night I was listening in to an interview from David Hauser, a serial B2B SaaS entrepreneur based out of Las Vegas who:
The interview is focused on how B2B SaaS companies can grow to $30M ARR.
David is best known for growing and scaling his own B2B SaaS companies.
When David wanted to launch Grasshopper he threw up a web page and started driving traffic to it with paid ads.
His goal was to see if they could sell their product package to the segment of the market that they believed no one was really selling to.
David believed in finding a process where they could close people online (he didn’t want to talk to them on the phone or go over proposals).
Very quickly they started seeing customers with a paid acquisition cost around $20-$40 per customer, so they then quickly started building the product.
Their base plan FreedomLITE started at $9.95/mo and their top plan FreedomPRO started at $19.95/mo, but their pricing was super complicated with lots of add-ons.
Here is a screenshot of their web page from back in January, 2003 that I was able to dig up (Note: Grasshopper used to be called GotVMail):
Even with the complicated add-on pricing, Grasshopper had a compelling unique value proposition that enabled them to sign up about 1,000 customers in the first 3 months from this website.
Key Takeaway: At the start it doesn’t matter if things are scrappy, they are meant to be. The most important thing is testing ‘message-to-market’ to see if there is a real need for your product idea (and validating it by having people pay).
In the beginning most of David’s customer acquisition was from paid traffic. After David saw where things were working with paid traffic, then he started spending time on organic.
David doesn’t like to start with organic traffic because it often takes longer than 3 months to optimize for important keywords.
He says too many people in Silicon Valley feel like it’s bad if you say you had to “pay for marketing”. David believes it’s actually the best thing possible… you know you can put $1 in and take $2 out.
David’s opinion on paid traffic goes against what almost everyone says, but have you stopped for a second and thought about whose saying paid traffic is bad? Do those people have any track record of growing $30M companies?
It doesn’t matter if you’re doing $1,000 or $100M… if you’re not talking about paid marketing, it’s a lost opportunity. Get out of the “Silicon Valley trap.” — David Hauser
Key Takeaway: If you’re looking for fast, early growth (or want to scale your current growth) you don’t need to growth hack your way to success. You can (and should) actually start with paid traffic to get early user growth which will fuel viral word of mouth referral if you have a great product.
David says to look at paid social media channels beyond Facebook.
Even though the click costs on Facebook haven’t gone up a lot (yet!), it is a very saturated ad platform.
Look outside the box at other self-service ad platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, etc if your product has some sort of visual representation.
Or if those aren’t a good fit, research other niche paid marketing channels you can exploit to find affordable, early stage paid growth channels.
Key Takeaway: If you’re just getting started with paid marketing, spend some time researching alternative low-cost paid advertising channels. Try to find the best one where you will be able to reach your target customer most cost efficiently.
At the start of the company 30% of David’s customers were referring Grasshopper to others via word of mouth because they had a great product solving an un-met need for their segment of the market.
Even today referrals are in the high 20–30% range, even with a very large customer base.
Essentially, David calculated that for every 100 customers he acquires with paid traffic, he would acquire another 20–30 from word of mouth referrals.
Key Takeaway: Word of mouth referral drives down your paid marketing cost. Most people don’t take this into account when thinking about paid marketing, which is also a reason why they don’t pay high enough attention to the impact of investing in paid traffic early.
As David scaled Grasshopper past $1M ARR and through different inflection points they drove their paid traffic costs up quite a bit (from acquiring customers at $20-$40 to $150-$180).
But then they hired an agency, got very good at optimizing and drove their customer acquisition cost back down under $100.
They learned what channels worked and developed a culture of testing by hiring the best agency talent they could.
Key Takeaway: You can’t expect your customer acquisition cost to be consistent month-over-month, but if you hire A-level agency talent then they will know what to optimize to keep your CPA at a profitable level.
David was collecting $30-$60 on average from a customer (their monthly price plus add-ons).
David knew his profit margin was around 70%.
So on a $45/mo customer, David was making roughly $31.50/mo.
With the lifetime value of a customer obviously being well over $31.50/mo, and the company being bootstrapped, David was comfortable spending 3X that to acquire a customer (ie: $94.50).
Key Takeaway: If you’re going to invest in paid traffic, know how much you can afford to acquire one customer. This will be your reference point to know which channels work and don’t work.
David billed customers a month ahead for their product, then he negotiated deal terms with his telecom vendors for 1–2 month payment terms because he was able to sell them on the idea of what they were doing.
Essentially David wasn’t paying vendors for 30–60 days, plus 30–45 days for vendors who took credit card payment.
This gave David a cash cushion of at least 60 days while they were investing in paid traffic to grow the business.
Key Takeaway: Cash that isn’t tied up with vendors can be used to grow the business and invest in paid traffic so you can build traction quickly and find what channels work.
When the company was $20M+ in revenue David decided to take on some debt capital.
The intended use for the debt capital was to take their $2M per year marketing budget to $14M per year.
It turned out to be a great decision and David paid off the debt way faster than expected.
The reason it worked out so well was because David knew he was only going to spend it scaling proven “$1 in, $2 out” marketing that was already working.
Key Takeaway: Once you know what marketing works, double down and invest in it heavily if you want to scale fast.
Throughout the interview David talks about different inflection points throughout the growth of his company. These are some of the insights David has for each stage of the journey to $30M ARR:
Key Takeaway: Nail a niche, use paid marketing and get sales fast. As you grow hand off your daily jobs to new hires and start to create a well-defined corporate structure. Hire A-player managers in every critical area of the business. Become more and more strategic as you grow and hire specialist talent where needed.
Towards the end of the interview David talks about a Grasshopper Labs program they launched to incubate new SaaS businesses and how it lost $1M in cash, plus more in terms of the time and focus they dedicated to it.
David thought they could apply what they learnt at Grasshopper to other SaaS projects and mentions all different kinds of failed SaaS projects where the product and market weren’t the right fit.
Interesting…
The only successful project to come out of Grasshopper Labs was Chargify.
David used paid traffic again to validate Chargify (with display ads on niche websites).
David didn’t have a dedicated marketing person for Chargify, so all the traffic they sent was to their home page (not a landing page).
Their idea was… we know we can convert more people, but let’s just get them to the page and validate we can get paying customers now.
Key Takeaway: There is a process you can use to launch, grow and scale SaaS products…. Paid Traffic > Unique Value Proposition > Validate Paying Customers > Build MVP > Repeat
But it won’t work if your product isn’t solving a very painful, un-met need in the market, and the implementation, packaging and marketing of your product doesn’t immediately cause people to want to take action and buy.
Don’t get brainwashed by the Silicon Valley methods for hacking growth and and scaling a B2B SaaS company.
David built his entire business on paid advertising.
As an angel investor, his advice to SaaS marketers and entrepreneurs today is… if you ever want to raise money, you’ll be in a much better position by being able to prove to investors you have paid marketing channels ready to scale.
If you are serious about building a highly scalable B2B SaaS company then you need to find what paid channels work for your business.

https://medium.com/point-nine-news/the-rise-of-non-vc-compatible-saas-companies-47054f1f3b29?source=search_post---------16,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
Hi there, we’re Point Nine Capital a VC firm focused on SaaS and marketplaces. If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
If there’s one aspect of the SaaS landscape that I saw changing tremendously the past 10 years, it’s definitely the rise of bootstrapped SaaS companies.
Financing a SaaS business with VCs or by bootstrapping is a topic which is more and more discussed. Not only an increasing number of founders shares their experience growing their SaaS business without outside funding but an increasing number of them shares their disillusion going the VC way as well.
Since it’s a topic that I discuss quite often with early stage founders, and which impacts VCs too, I want to address it properly and share my point of view in this post.
For the purpose of this article I’ll distinguish four types of SaaS companies:
What’s important here are not so much the different ARR ranges, which can be discussed and adjusted, but the trends for the different categories:
In the category #1 for the past couple of years the trend is toward an increasing number of SaaS companies being funded but it’s linked to the capital available and the will of VCs to invest or not. For category #2 I also think we’re seeing more of these companies but they are still very rare and we cannot say that there’s an explosion of them.
If there’s an explosion which is changing the SaaS landscape it’s definitely happening in the categories #3 and #4. When I entered the SaaS world 10 years ago (building a product on top of flash…) I knew very few founders running bootstrapped SaaS companies. Raising money was the main way to go. But this has changed and I now encounter, almost on a weekly basis, awesome bootstrapped software companies and micro SaaS.
The available market is getting bigger: more and more businesses buy SaaS products and don’t need to be educated anymore. From SMBs to enterprise customers.
Building and distributing a SaaS product is easier, faster and less expensive: thanks to developer tools, APIs and the emergence of software platforms (e.g: SalesForce, Zapier, Segment…).
Advice from people “who have done it” is widely available online: as Jason Lemkin wrote in a tweet: “It’s possible there is now sufficient startup advice on the internet”
All these factors make bootstrapping a SaaS company beyond several million dollars of ARR, without raising VC money, a more and more viable and proven path.
An important characteristic of this growing trend of companies is that a big chunk of them are not “VC compatible”. For various reasons:
The majority of these companies have their sweet spot in the tens to hundreds thousands dollars of MRR. Once reached they’ll continue to grow but more slowly and they won’t scale to millions dollars of MRR. A minority will enter category #2 and become the new Mailchimp or Atlassian.
I by NO MEAN suggest / imply that non “VC compatible” companies are inferior or less prestigious to VC compatible ones:
Without going into details the aim of a VC is to invest money in companies in order to get a return on investment (ROI) through exits (the startup gets acquired or goes public etc…). In general the faster and bigger a company grows the better the return on investment for the VC is. And this is why we are chasing this kind of companies and why financing a company with VC money makes no sense if the founders are not aligned with this aim.
Edit: For those interested in the alternative financing aspect here are some data points from Tom Tunguz “A Spike Of Venture Debt In Startups”
As an early stage founder if you have no idea on which side you’re leaning toward here are some questions that you can ask yourself :
The very first thing to clear out is whether the VC model fits your personal aspirations as an entrepreneur or not:
The characteristics of your business / product / market positioning also play a role:
Again, the line between VC compatible and not compatible businesses can be very thin and change over time — especially at early stage. There are plenty examples of awesome startups which started as a “feature” to later evolve to big businesses. However it’s a tiny, tiny minority and in the majority of the cases they could show huge traction without raising at first.
As a conclusion I want to emphasis, again, the fact that the VC path is not better or more prestigious than the bootstrap one. Working on the VC side myself my first aim is to be aligned with the founders we work with.
If their aim is to build fast growing companies with the help of VCs then it makes sense to work together. But if they prefer to do so by financing their business purely thanks to the revenue they manage to generate from their customers it’s fantastic too.
There’s no “evil” or “angel” here, these are just two different approaches to building a business and everyone (founders as well as VCs) should chose its path wisely.

https://rocketshipgrowth.com/how-the-worlds-biggest-saas-companies-leverage-inbound-to-dominate-a-market-cae780d38bcd?source=search_post---------212,"Do you bring in 10,000+ people/month to your website from inbound (blog or home page), but your scared of investing in new media channels?
Do you feel like your missing out on a big channel?
You might be stuck in what I call the “inbound marketing comfort zone of death”.
Let me explain why it is so deadly…
Most SaaS companies do pretty well with inbound… some even bring in hundreds of thousands of website visitors per month.
If all you do is inbound, you’re probably thinking:
Both of these things are great… if you want to keep costs low and are happy with the number of people who convert from your inbound traffic into leads.
But what if you want to dominate a market, convert a much larger % of your inbound traffic into leads and scale quickly?
Inbound ONLY marketing will kill your growth.
Why?
Because you could be growing A LOT faster by leveraging your #1 inbound marketing asset (ie: your website traffic).
Let’s say you have 100,000 unique website visitors per month.
In the scenario above you have 3 key audiences:
Audience #1: 100,000 Website Visitors
Audience #2: 2,000 Trials or Demos
Audience #3: 400 Paid Customers
What if you could take your largest audience (ie: your website visitors) and double the number that convert into a trial/demo for your SaaS?
I’m going to show you a proven method you can use to leverage your inbound traffic (all the hard work you’ve done over the years to grow your SaaS to where it is today) to get more of your website visitors signing up for a trial/demo of your software.
You might be one of those SaaS companies who just does inbound + retargeting.
But did you know that… most SaaS companies GROSSLY under utilize retargeting.
For example, most SaaS companies spend years developing their inbound content strategy and thousands of hours writing inbound content, then they just go and use Facebook custom audiences and pixels.
They call that retargeting. It works but it’s a tear drop in the ocean.
The next level is Facebook + AdWords so you can also follow people around the web. This is decent, but still grossly under utilizing retargeting.
At this point every SaaS company knows retargeting works.
For most SaaS companies, it’s the one guaranteed profit campaign they can always count on.
So then why does everyone stop at one or two ad networks??
Maybe they just don’t know other spots that exist???
Well today, you have a plan to turn more of your inbound website traffic into leads for your SaaS (and I’m giving you the whole plan for free)…
Google Display adsGoogle Gmail adsYouTube adsFacebook adsTwitter adsTaboola adsYahoo Gemini adsAOL ONE ads
Retargeting across ad networks is the first step. But if you want to get more granular with it, then pictured above is a “Pixel Funnel Retargeting” campaign for a SaaS company.
This is an advanced tracking and optimization technique used to:
Most people don’t know this, but this is the advanced stuff that silicon valley guys are doing enabling hyper-growth companies like AirBNB, Uber and Dropbox.
It makes them seem like they are in more places than they actually are.
Combine that with the TOFU-MOFU-BOFU model that works because it is proven to convert traffic into leads, and you have a massive hit.
A common question I get after telling people where to run ads is…
Where should I send people after they click on my ad? To a blog post, opt-in page or trial/demo page?
The simple answer is… TOFU-MOFU-BOFU.
Because we are specifically talking about inbound traffic in this article, your website visitors already know who you are so you might be tempted to just send people straight to a page with a trial or demo of your software.
That might work for you if you have a low <$50/mo ARPU (average-revenue-per-user) and low-touch sales process with no sales team.
But if your selling a high ARPU >$50/mo SaaS product, I personally prefer to acquire, filter and qualify every lead with TOFU-MOFU-BOFU.
If you don’t know what TOFU-MOFU-BOFU is, read this article.
If I was just getting started with paid ads and had a SaaS business with significant inbound traffic, this is what I would do:
Step 1) Open a Google AdWords account, Facebook Ads account, Twitter Ads account, Taboola Ad account, Yahoo Gemini Ad account and AOL ONE Ad account
Step 2) Place all the tracking pixels from the ad networks on every page of my website
Step 3) Setup 3 TOFU ads, 3 MOFU ads and 3 BOFU ads to split test on all the ad networks
Step 4) Target all my website visitors to my TOFU opt-in page (excluding those who have hit my TOFU thank you page) with the 3 TOFU ads
Step 5) Target all my TOFU thank you page visitors to my MOFU opt-in page (excluding those who have hit my MOFU thank you page) with the 3 MOFU ads
Step 6) Target all my MOFU thank you page visitors to my BOFU opt-in page (excluding those who have hit my BOFU thank you page) with my 3 BOFU ads
Step 7) Create a lookalike audience to find new customers who are similar to my website visitors (and take them through step 3–6 above)
If this all seems too overwhelming, start with 1 ad network at a time and build up. Start with GDN (the biggest ad network in the world) with ads going to your TOFU. Once that ad network meets your target CPA, then expand to the next ad network, and so on.
The beauty of this strategy is you are using what you know already works (ie: retargeting) and is cheaper than targeting cold traffic to reach people you’ve already invested to attract to your website via inbound marketing.
Now you are just using paid ads to guide them through your proven, inbound sales funnel across the whole web.
HubSpot, one of the kings of SaaS inbound marketing have been using this strategy for years to generate 60,000+ leads per month.
NOTE: Some ad networks won’t let you exclude website audiences from your targeting. To do it with GDN, you should create all your audience “buckets” (eg: TOFU thank you page, MOFU thank you page, etc) inside Google Analytics Audience Builder, then setup your targeting inside GDN.
When Optimizly was looking for a granular yet simple way to remarket visitors at specific points in their sales funnel, this is the campaign they ran.
The results:
Optimizely’s case study can be found here.
The secret to large SaaS companies market dominance is largely due to extensive retargeting.
You gotta leverage your inbound traffic by thinking bigger with your retargeting. Not bigger in terms of less qualified people, mass pixeling or higher banner ad frequency.
Bigger in terms of blanketing the web.
When you leverage your inbound traffic and are everywhere it creates a whole new effect that makes small budgets work like big budgets.

Top highlight
My co-founder (Benoit Hediard) and I started Agorapulse five years ago. From day one, we knew that we wanted to create a truly international SaaS business. “Truly international” meant being able to work primarily in English but also serve our users in French, Spanish and Portuguese.
At the very beginning we worked with translation services, but as soon as we were able to afford it, we started looking for native speakers to join the team. And guess where you can find the best native speakers to help you grow your business? In their own country ;-)
Building a remote team quickly became the only (and best option) for us. As of today, our 28 team members are located in 7 countries but we still have an office in Paris with 6 full time and 3 semi remote team members (9 total, that’s one third of the team). The 17 others work entirely remotely.
But with a great remote team comes great responsibilities, which include finding, evaluating, and selecting tools to run your business remotely!
Here are the 31 tools we’re using today (and why we love them). While most of them are not designed to specifically address the needs of remote teams, they almost all offer valuable features for a distributed workforce.
We adopted Facebook workplace a month ago when it was in Beta. If you’ve never used it, it’s a private Facebook just for your business — with a couple of twists to adapt it to a business environment.
The main motivation was to see if this could be THE asynchronous communication tool we could use in addition to Slack (being our synchronous communication tool).
After a month of use, this is what I think about it:
Why is Facebook Workplace a must have for remote teams? It facilitates casual conversations and content sharing among your team members. As it embeds all the basic Facebook features everyone already knows and uses (comments, likes, mentions), it’s easy to get started and to give feedback to other team members. While Slack is a great tool to keep that team spirit alive in real time, Facebook Workplace can be the one asynchronous tool to help your team socialize. (Our “Agorapulse Musical Tastes” group on Workplace is really popular with our team.)
Slack is definitely the hot communication tool for teams these days. About this time last year, it quickly becomes the main gathering place for all our team communication.
Watch out though. It’s a real-time communication tool that can quickly go out of control if you don’t pay attention:
Why is Slack a must have for remote teams? First, you immediately know if your team members are online or not, which is pretty useful when you work in different time zones. It’s also super easy to set up channels by team / job so you can keep everyone on the same page. Finally, it’s the only place where your remote team can have that feeling of a “living office.” Asynchronous tools don’t convey that feeling.
Basecamp is the grandfather of project management. It lacks the bells and whistles of more sophisticated tools like Asana, but this is why it’s a great tool for simpler projects. When we launch a specific project with remote team members, Basecamp is the easiest way to have a place where we can share all the key documents and have discussions about how the project is going.
It’s better suited for short term projects (the ones you need to start fast and will within 3 to 6 months) and for non-structured projects (where the need for task management, a roadmap or GANTT chart doesn’t exist).
You can use it for a lot of simple projects. For example, we’ve created a template for onboarding new employees and we use it to make sure that every new team member has all the tools and assets they need to get started.
Why is Basecamp a must have for remote teams? The main reason is that you need tools to organize team communication. In a remote environment, email just won’t cut it and Slack is only adapted for real-time conversations. Basecamp is really easy to use and very well suited for simple projects.
Asana is the tool of reference for our marketing team. The main reason is because we operate in monthly sprints (you know, that agile methodology) and we want to be able to measure the number of items / tests we have for each monthly sprint and what percentage of these tests we were able to run.
It’s also the best way to stay organized as a team and make sure we’re not losing focus and are staying on track with our big goals.
Why is asana a must have for remote teams? Being remote makes team communication more challenging. It’s also harder to make sure everyone understand the big picture and stay focused. Asana can help with that in a meaningful way.
I can’t imagine ever going back to Microsoft Office. Since we started adopting Google Docs as the go-to tool for documents, spreadsheets and presentations, things have become so much easier!
In the early days, Word, Excel or PowerPoint had a couple of power features that were really missing in Google Docs. But these days, I never run into limitations even with the trickiest feature.
The huge plusses are:
Why is Google Docs a must have for remote teams? All of the above :-)
As stated above, we don’t use Microsoft Office anymore, but we still have a bunch of Word, Excel or PowerPoint documents. Piled onto that, we have tons of extra files like PDFs, scanned docs, invoices, etc.
Dropbox is a great tool to get them all organized teamwide and make sure nothing gets lost on someone’s hard drive. We use it a lot for all accounting, HR and legal documents. It’s also a super simple way to share documents with a third party, like setting up a virtual data room with your auditor.
Why is Dropbox a must have for remote teams? Storing company documents on somebody’s hard drive is just a big no-no. You need team access and safe backups.
Being a “semi-remote” team, we do a lot of communication using web conferencing tools (mainly Google Hangouts, Skype and appear.in). As our remote team grew, it became difficult to use those solutions for our weekly video meetings. We ran into a ton of audio and video issues and not all of the solutions had enough “room” for all our team members.
That’s when we decided to use Highfive. It’s a device you plug on your flat screen TV that comes with a wide angle camera as well as a crystal clear Dolby speaker and 360 degree microphone. It really feels like the other participants are in the room with you.
Why is Highfive a must have for remote teams? When you want to connect two or more offices, Highfive is really second to none when it comes to A/V quality. A must have for better remote communication.
Appear.in is a video conferencing system that’s entirely based on the browser. There’s no software to install and no need to create an account. Just share the URL of your meeting room and simply wait for your participants show up. The big win versus Skype or Hangout is that there’s a lot less friction in participating to call as it’s as easy as copying and pasting a URL.
Why is appear.in a must have for remote teams? If you need to have quick chats with your team members or users, or share voice, video and screens, it’s the easiest option out there.
Join.me is the web conferencing we use when our counterparts cannot use the audio/video capabilities of their computer and want to join by calling a phone number. (appear.in doesn’t provide a phone number to join.)
You can also record join.me calls which can be useful for training. For example, when we provide a tour of our app to a new team member, or explain how to use one of our tools, we often record the call so it can be used for other (future) team members as well. No need to redo the same demo over and over again.
Why is join.me a must have for remote teams? The fact that you can record calls makes it easy to create training materials for your team. Need to show a team member something they need to know but other team members may need that training as well in the future? Hit record and save time moving forward.
Intercom is the main tool we use to communicate with our users (both free trial and paid customers). It’s used for support, on-boarding messaging, feature announcements and one-on-one communications for customer success.
The main reason we’ve switched to Intercom is to centralize all customer communications in one place. Prior to Intercom, we used to do support using Helpscout and on-boarding messaging using customer.io and switching to one tool to another was a bit cumbersome.
But keep in mind that like with every all-in-one tool, it’s not the best tool at everything. For example, it’s lacking key support features that Helpscout offers, like feedback on support messages or decent statistics about your team workload (and response time).
Why is Intercom a must have for remote teams? When you want to have all your conversations with your users in one place and collaborate with your remote team when handling them, Intercom can be very useful.
Are there any alternatives? Well, since Intercom has become very pricey over the years, you may want to look at alternatives. I’ve found one that’s pretty similar and much more affordable, it’s called Crisp.
As stated above, we’ve decided to work with Intercom for all user related communications. But when it comes to nurturing leads, Intercom is really not the right tool. We simply could not capture email addresses and nurture those leads with Intercom. So we had to pick a specific tool to take our lead nurturing to the next step. After a long evaluation process, we chose ActiveCampaign, mostly because it was bundled with API connections with most of the other tools we already use.
Why is ActiveCampaign a must have for remote teams? ActiveCampaign is not specifically designed for remote teams, it’s valuable for all teams, remote or not.
As a self service software priced for low to no touch, we invest a lot on the on-boarding experience of our free trials. We’ve tried every self-serve education approach, including the creation of our own homemade on-boarding guides. Appcues seems to be the best tool to guide new users and show them the key features of your app they need to be aware of.
It offers a lot of look & feel options, A/B testing capabilities and stats than can help you test your on-boarding assumptions.
Why is AppCues a must have for remote teams? AppCues is not specifically designed for remote teams. It’s valuable for all teams, remote or not.
Since we started to seriously invest in customer success, we’ve been looking for a tool to help us with this important endeavor.
Salesmachine is the only tool we’ve found to help us with our customer success needs that doesn’t cost several thousands of dollars per month. When we got started, we couldn’t afford the Totangos and Gainsights of the world.
Salesmachine provides useful statistics about your users’ health as well as the ability to identify red flags based on user behaviors and a trigger-automated workflow for your customer success team to work with.
Why is Salesmachine a must have for remote teams? If your customer success team is remote, Salesmachine provides great tools to work collaboratively on your customer success goals without stepping on each other’s toes.
Providing great support starts with providing great self help support. The vast majority of users don’t want to chat with a support agent — they want to figure things out by themselves. According to Zendesk, 67% of users prefer self help support than sending an email.
The unique value proposition of Support Hero is that it allows us to embed our self help support content in a widget right within our app. This is the best possible experience for our users who don’t have to click on a link and exit our app to get the support they need. It also provides a LOT of stats about the performance of our self help support articles. Super helpful.
Why is Support Hero a must have for remote teams? With a remote support team, it is key to have a shared knowledge base every team member can access and edit. We use Support Hero with the entire support team (everyone can contribute) and we even have a “private” knowledge base for all the content that’s only useful for team members (not for our users).
If you’re serious about providing top notch support and user experience, FullStory is a must have. It’s this kind of tool you don’t know you need until you experience it for the first time and think “Oh shit! I had no idea we had that problem!”
Putting it simply, FullStory records all the sessions of your users. It’s like standing behind their shoulders when they use your product and witnessing how they do it (and struggle with it sometimes). You have very powerful filtering options allowing you to watch sessions of users using a specific feature or new users only. For support, it can show you what users were doing right before they sent you a support ticket. A total time saver.
Why is FullStory a must have for remote teams? It’s not a tool designed specifically for remote teams. But it’s useful for all teams, remote or not.
Before using Receptive, we had no process to capture user feedback. This was frustrating for us as we had no data backed process to gauge what feature we should add (or fix) next. Our users would make feature suggestions but would never know if we ended up implementing them.
We looked at all solutions on the market to manage customer feedback. When we stumbled upon Receptive, it really was one of those “aha” moments!
Receptive allows us to:
Why is Receptive a must have for remote teams? While Receptive is not specifically designed for remote teams and can be used by any SaaS company, it’s very helpful to provide your remote support or customer success team with one place to gather all the feedback they get from users. It’s also useful for our product team to review that data without having to discuss with the customer facing team members who are not in the same time zone as they are.
Segment is really the lifeblood of all our app’s and users’ data. All our events are captured by Segment which then connects to all our tools (Kissmetrics, Salesmachine, Appcues, ActiveCampaign, Intercom, etc.) so all the tools we use that needs to collect event data are pulling them from the same, unified source.
It also allows us to test new tools and by simply clicking a button, all our data is sent to them without any engineering time being spent. Life saver when you’re small and lean.
Why is Segment a must have for remote teams? Segment is not specifically designed for remote teams, but its ability to try new tools with any engineering involvement allows remote team members to test and adopt new tools with a lot less friction.
ChartMogul is where all our business metrics live (MRR, ARR, LTV, ARPU, churn, etc.).
This is not a team tool, nor does it provide any kind of collaboration features. But as a remote team, we want every team member to have transparent access to our financial health. As a consequence, we give access to ChartMogul to each team member. When the end of the month comes by, everybody knows how much progress we’ve made and that’s a great feeling!
Why is ChartMogul a must have for remote teams? If, like us, you want your team to really feel part of the adventure, sharing all your financial details in real time can be a great idea. It can also give them comfort if you’re growing and generating profit. Maybe not something that would work for companies having financial difficulties or slow growth. But eventually, they’ll know anyway, so why hide it?
Kissmetrics is our go-to resource for everything data analysis related. Every member of the marketing team has access to Kissmetrics and is trained to efficiently use it to query our data and get the answers they need.
Why is Kissmetrics a must have for remote teams? Kissmetrics is not specifically designed for all teams — remote or otherwise.
While Pendo is a multifaceted user support tool, we use it primarily to measure feature usage on Agorapulse. We then use that data to determine what features are used the most and by whom.
For example, our social media publishing feature allows users to schedule their content (at a specific date and time), add their content to a predefined content queue or publish their content immediately. According to Pendo, 90% of the content published via our platform is scheduled, not queued or published immediately. This is an essential piece of information for our product team when we have to decide what to improve in our publishing tool. In this case, offering better scheduling options should come before improving our content queue feature.
Why is Pendo a must have for remote teams? Pendo is not specifically designed for remote teams. It’s valuable for all teams, remote or not.
Our list wouldn’t be complete with Agorapulse, of course :-)
We eat our own dog food an use Agorapulse daily to manage our Social media tasks. As a business owner, the three things I love about Agorapulse are:
Why is Agorapulse a must have for remote teams? Agorapulse offers advanced team collaboration features that come in handy for any remote team: assigning incoming content, reporting on team member workload and response time, and assigning drafts for approval.
A good marketer should always be testing her assumptions. A/B test is clearly the kind of thing you need a tool for. We chose optimizely a long time ago and have stuck with it.
One of the reasons we like it, beyond its WYSIWYG interface, is its connection to Kissmetrics (mentioned above). That connection is the key as a succesful A/B test should not be limited to what’s hapening on the top of the funnel (the page you’re currently testing) but should also show you the results at the bottom of the funnel as well (trial conversion, paid conversion, LTV, ARPU).
Our most successful tests proved to be succesful on metrics that Optimzely could not report on (mostly revenue related). Actually, these sucessful A/B test showed lower conversion on the page (like fewer free trials), but higher revenue at the bottom of the funnel (better conversion from free trial to paid or higher revenue per user).
Why is Optimizely a must have for remote teams? Optimizely is not specifically designed for remote teams. It’s valuable for all teams, remote or not.
If you run Facebook ad campaigns, you’ve probably already used the native Facebook ad manager or even its Power Editor if you manage a lot of ads.
For a “casual” Facebook advertiser like me, these two native Facebook tools are too complicated. Not to mention that Facebook keeps changing them (and I don’t have the time to keep up).
AdEspresso makes it simple to create and optimize Facebook ad campaigns. For me it’s a no brainer. It also allows A/B tests of copy, visual, landing page and targeting. A must do if you want to optimize your results.
Why is AdEspresso a must have for remote teams? Adespresso is not specifically designed for remote teams, but if you have several team members looking at your ad campaigns, it’s useful to have one place where you can quickly see how every campaign /ads are performing.
Github is the central hub for all our code: all our open source Grails plugins and Groovy/Java libs repos, but also our private repos. It really makes coding seamless as a remote team.
Why is Github a must have for remote teams? Github is the de facto standard for code sharing and remote collaboration. All developers are used to it.
Pivotal Tracker is where our developers, QA and support team members live. It’s the best way to keep track of bugs and feature improvement in an organized way.
The mobile version is pretty useful too.
Why is Pivotal Tracker a must have for remote teams? When your developers don’t work in the same place as your QA or support team, a tool like Pivotal Tracker is really the only way to keep the whole team on the same page.
We recently strated to work with a talented UI/UX team member in Paris on the overall redesign of our app and our website. But the key stakeholders are all around the world. Our CMO in Portland (USA), our product manager in Poitiers (France), the two cofounders in Paris (France) and the developers are both in Paris and Buenos Aires (Argentina).
InVision is really the only way to make sure we can give feedback on design proposals as a team.
Why is Invision a must have for remote teams? UI/UX is an aspect of the business that requires a LOT of feedback, iterations and conversations. Collaboration is key and when your team is remote, you can’t live without InVision.
RescueTime is an awesome time management tool. You install it on your laptop and it tracks everything you do. The tool tells you if you’re productive or not and how many hours you’ve worked.
My co-founder and I use it to keep track of our own productivity.
Some of our team members do too, but we’ve not required the entire team to use this tool as we were afraid they may consider it invasive. We may revisit that in the future. When used right, it’s a great tool to force yourself to stay focused. It can also be used to help your team do the same.
Why is RescueTime a must have for remote teams? Being remote means it’s hard to get a sense about how productive we all are. RescueTime can help us being accountable. When used individually, we’re all accountable to ourselves. That’s already a good start. It can be enough. The team edition can create transparency as the data can be visible team wide. A little bit of competition can boost productivity, but this may not work for all teams.
Hubstaff is a time tracking tool. It’s pretty drastic as it records the time spent by team members on your tasks, how much time they’ve been active and can even take screenshots of their activity every five minutes! Pretty Big Brother like.
Definitely not something I’d use for our regular team. However, when hiring a freelancer for a specific task or a virtual assistant (VA) where the quantity of work done matters more than quality, Hubstaff can be useful. Especially if you don’t feel you can trust them up front.
Why is Hubstaff a must have for remote teams? There are certain jobs (Internet research, database building / cleaning, email hunting, etc.) for which you may need to hire VAs, part time or full time, and it can be hard to check on their productivity. Hubstaff is great to just make sure that the job gets done and the number of hours you’re paying for are being put in.
Have you ever had trouble trying to find a convenient day and time to chat with a team member? This can be a real headache, especialy if you are both working in different time zones.
Calendly makes booking calls mega easy. Just share your booking link with anyone in your team (or outside!) and they’ll be able to book a time with you when you’re available. It’s a no brainer!
Why is Calendly a must have for remote teams? Calendly makes it super easy to book meetings, no more endless back and forth via email to find a convenient time. This is super helpful for booking calls with customers or users, but it’s also very useful internally. All my team members have my calendly link and they know they can book a time with me any time they want. No friction!
Screencast-o-matic is one of the few tools I use on a daily basis. It’s useful for both customer support and communication for our remote team.
When I want to show someone something that’s happening on my screen, whether to show how to do something or to discuss an issue with our tool (or any tool we use), doing a screencast is usually the way to go to save time and be efficient.
Making a screencast and sharing it with screencast-o-matic versus writing a long explanation with screenshots can save me hours of work every week.
Why is Screencast-o-matic a must have for remote teams? When you need to give feedback to a remote team member or you want to show them how to do something, making a screencast is the fastest and most efficient way to go.
1Password is a helpful tool to store all your login/passwords in a safe place. You can also use LastPass. One of the great feautres these tools offer is a way to share passwords with your team.
With all the tools we use, looking for a specific password can be a huge waste of time. 1Password or LastPass will make this pain go away!
Why is 1Password or LastPass a must have for remote teams? You use a lot of tools with your teams, don’t you? In that lies the answer.

https://medium.com/point-nine-news/how-public-saas-companies-report-churn-and-what-you-can-learn-from-them-544fcca61ff6?source=search_post---------158,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
While doing some research for another post I just stumbled on this excellent overview from Pacific Crest on the churn rates of publicly listed SaaS companies. I’ve seen posts with churn benchmarks of public SaaS companies before, but this one is by far the most comprehensive collection I’ve seen and I think it’s very useful.
What’s maybe even more interesting than taking a look at the numbers themselves is to see how different companies define churn (or the inverse, retention). Since there is no official US-GAAP definition of churn or retention, different companies use different ways to measure and report these metrics. And because public companies are under the scrutiny by the SEC, any non-GAAP metric they report must be accompanied by a razor-sharp definition.
Most public SaaS companies report churn in the form of their dollar-based net retention rate, i.e. the inverse of net MRR/ARR churn (as opposed to account/logo churn), which compares the recurring revenue from a set of customers across comparable periods. Here’s a particularly nice description of this metric, coming from AppDynamics:
“To calculate our dollar-based net retention rate for a particular trailing 12-month period, we first establish the recurring contract value for the previous trailing 12-month period. This effectively represents recurring dollars that we should expect in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period without any expansion or contraction. We subsequently measure the recurring contract value in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period. Dollar-based net retention rate is then calculated by dividing the aggregate recurring contract value in the current trailing 12-month period by the previous trailing 12-month period.”
If you take a look at the data assembled by Pacific Crest you’ll see that many companies use the same logic with minor variations. For example, some companies look at the trailing 12 month period, while others look at calendar years, quarters, or months. Some companies exclude customers that do not meet certain criteria, for example:
This makes perfect sense: It tells you what type of customer the company is focused on, and you can see the retention metrics in regards to this type of customer.
Other companies use variations that I think are questionable. Some companies report customer count-based retention, which I think is much less interesting than dollar-based retention. Some report renewal based on the number of seats; one company, Fleetmatics, reports churn based on the number of vehicles under subscription. But the majority of companies does report dollar-based net retention rate in a way that allows for an apples-to-apples comparison across companies.
What can you learn from this?
(1) There is not one perfect definition of churn that is right for every SaaS company. Depending on the specifics of your business you might want to:
(2) Having said that, dollar-based net retention is the way to go. You should stay close to the definition above and tweak it with care.
(3) There may not be one perfect way to define and measure churn, but there sure are lots of ways to get it wrong. :) One classic example is to calculate a monthly churn rate and to mix in annual plans with monthly plans. By including customers on annual plans who aren’t up for renewal in the period you’re measuring you’re underestimating your true churn rate.
(4) Whatever metric you choose, make sure that you use it consistently and that you have a razor-sharp definition.
Bonus tip: Whenever you report numbers, be it in monthly updates or in a Board deck, include footnotes or an appendix with definitions of every metric that you’re reporting. I can almost guarantee you that this will save you ten minutes of discussion with your VC Board member(s) who (understandably) want to make sure that they understand the numbers you’re showing them. :)

It’s common to hear “SaaS has great margins,” but that’s not true. The margins in SaaS are terrible as the data below show. The table has 42 publicly traded SaaS companies with median revenue of $180mm meaning they’re well past the startup stage and margins should benefit from their scale and maturity. However, even though they’re past the high burn growth stage, the median operating margin is -21% as 32 of the 42 companies generate operating losses.
Additionally while the variable costs of SaaS are very low (hosting, servers, etc), the fixed costs are very high, especially for engineering talent and developers. Given the speed at which technology becomes obsolete, the hiring of engineering/dev talent never really ends as each company has to constantly improve and evolve its product. Even worse, the fixed costs are all human talent, making cost cuts/layoffs really painful for morale, culture, and productivity of other personnel.
Investors love SaaS businesses because so long as you’re retaining the customer, the revenue is basically an annuity and in many cases a source of growth (when customers upgrade more often than they downgrade). Additionally, for mission critical software, recession resilience tends to be very high (we saw this in 2008 and 2020). If customer acquisition costs can be held within reason and retention is strong, the business will eventually be profitable, and large. By way of example, the average and median operating margins for the profitable companies above is 14% and 11% respectively. Ok margins, but not great.

While social distancing is good for your health, it’s bad for businesses. A long list of business-types are being affected. Retail businesses are losing foot traffic, restaurants are empty, and tech SaaS companies are losing subscribers — shooting churn rates through the roof. Businesses of all kinds are working tirelessly to retain their clients during COVID-19 — you should be too. But how? Many businesses are worried that the impact of COVID-19 will be longer than anticipated. As a result, SAAS companies (along with many others) are looking for ways to keep their clients during the coronavirus lockdown. Here are some tips to keep your clients engaged from a distance.
Communicate proactively with your clients
Keep your clients close. Even though consumer confidence is dropping, there will be clients that aren’t affected by COVID-19, and there will be clients that have been affected, however, they still require your services to function. Your priority needs to be ensuring that your product is of value during this troubling time.
Let your clients know why they should continue working with you. If they have rewards available, and ready to claim, be sure to remind them. If they are close to reaching a threshold to unlock rewards or to move up to another tier, make sure to let them know.
Think about what you can be doing to keep clients feeling confident about retaining their services with you.
Gift your corporate client a virtual fitness class
Everyone is stuck at home, losing their minds.
Working from home isn’t easy, everyone has been forced to turn their place of relaxation into their place of work. (I’ve published a blog RE: How to actually get sh*t down while working from home, read it if you need some help in that department!). One thing that working from home creates, is a lack of productivity. That couch you’d pass out on daily, if not weekly becomes your workspace.
Endorphins are produced by working out and are known for improving productivity significantly. Being sluggish all day is damaging to everyone’s health.
It’s such a unique gift to send the gift of employee morale-boosting. Your clients will be able to host a virtual event for up to 50 employees, and they’ll have SO much virtual fun! And, you’ll be the one they thank.
Not only can you give this to your clients. You can use these virtual fitness events to bring on new clients, and finally convert clients that have been leaving you hanging. It’s such a unique demand gen tactic, and we’re blown away by how our clients are using this new product during such marketing-crazy times.
P.s. SUPER cheap! Only $199/ event, with an instructor from any of the following big fitness brands.
Book an event here, and learn more about our virtual events here.
Form new relationships
Many SAAS companies have made the decision to stop paid acquisition channels; like SEM, and Facebook advertising, because they’ve noticed the effectiveness has decreased significantly. It brings on pressure, but it’s important to realize that acquisition doesn’t need to stop completely.
Your current clients are your cheerleaders at this time, your biggest asset. They love your brand and can leave you some positive reviews, which will convert other clients. They also have the ability to spread the word about your business, and ultimately become a lead generating advocate.
Incentivizing reviews and referrals, with loyalty points or a cash bonus is the best chance to get these behaviors happening often. You may not see some immediate results, but you will long-term as things start to return to normal. You can even incentivize social media engagement by rewarding your clients every time they mention your business.
Work on getting people talking about your brand as much as possible.
Build a community
Research shows that 68 percent of people become loyal to a brand when they realize a business shares the same values as they do. This is the opportunity to prove your current customer base that you share their beliefs. This is going to allow you to build a strong community of clients with a sense of belonging.
You can incorporate your beliefs by adding some messaging to your current emails, website popups, social media posts, and blogs — remember, content is king. And, historically content has always provided the most boost coming out of troubling times.
You can choose temporary causes, or causes that are affecting your customers. Choose messaging that brings your business and clients together — considering the current climate.
Conclusion
Honestly, we’re in a time of uncertainty. COVID-19 has been bringing out some of the best behaviors people have. Which, ultimately gives businesses like yours the opportunity to prove to your existing client base that you care — that you’re there to support them as they see challenging times ahead. Continue to create meaningful relationships.

Top highlight
This article is the first of a series of two posts taken from a workshop focused on lead generation that we held during our Point Nine SaaS Founder Meetup. If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
In November 2016 we held a two days #SaaSCamp during which we organised many workshops on topics ranging from product, finance, HR, sales and marketing.
One of the topics that was frequently requested by our portfolio companies is lead generation. Lead generation is a hot topic for many SaaS startups as they are, for most of them, never satisfied with their results and always trying to find ways to generate more leads.
So we decided to interview startups from our portfolio (and several from outside for a total of 20 companies) to create their lead generation profile and see if there was some interesting insights to draw from it.
One very interesting learning is that, when it comes to the fastest growing SaaS companies, 3 lead generation profiles emerged:
What’s important to understand here is that I’ve depicted “patterns” on the diagram above:
[EDIT]
Several people asked me why the channels #2 and #3 were =>
It’s actually not a typo but the only way I found to say that channels #2 and #3 could be any combination of these 3 channels:
I know it might be a bit confusing so if you have an idea on how to better visualize it please tell me @clemnt.
When you look at the 3 profiles above you notice that the channel from where most of the leads seems to come is the “organic — direct” channel.
Why is that?
The reason is that most of the fastest growing SaaS interviewed had a viral coefficient k well above 0.
I won’t come back in details on the concept of growth loops, you can read this article for a great overview, but basically for every acquisition tactic that you use you can calculate how much newly acquired users contribute to the acquisition of the next cohort of users.
Some acquisition tactics can be really viral (for SaaS standard). For instance the “powered by tactic” can lead to a k > 0.4, meaning that every 10 users acquired will generate 4 extras users. Some channels are inherently less “viral”, like Google Adwords that has a typical k factor between 0 and 0.2.
And very often when your viral coeff is high for a specific acquisition channel it deeply impacts the “Organic-direct” channel. Here are some examples of this phenomenon:
There are three important aspects I want to emphasis:
In all cases a maximum of 2–3 channels generated +90% of the monthly new leads.
I didn’t encounter any startup with 10 different channels contributing each to 10% of their overall lead generation effort.
I think there are two reasons behind that:

Be the first to respond.
To get Customer.io off the ground in May 2012, we raised $125k in small checks from friends and family plus two angel investors. At the time of that investment, our total capital raised was equivalent to two hundred and eight times (20,833% of) our current annual revenue run rate (ARR).
We were making about $50 per month or $600 a year.  Our business was risky. We had almost no revenue. Unless we made a miracle happen or raised money, we’d likely have to close up shop. Without much to lose, we were fine to spin the roulette wheel and bet it all on red.  Over time we’ve received additional investments, but we haven’t continued down the path of betting it all on red and doing things like raising 20,833% of revenue each time we’ve fundraised.
In 2013, after a sharply declining strap ratio (and almost running out of funds), we raised more money bringing the total to 1,103% of ARR. Then in 2015 we did it again. This time it was 127% of ARR. Most recently in 2017 we saw an opportunity to invest in the business ahead of revenue again and raised a fraction of our ARR bringing our total funds raised to 76% of ARR.  VC-backed companies track metrics like valuation, ARR, and rates of growth, but they often overlook the capital it took to achieve those outcomes. Capital efficiency isn’t considered. The company places bigger and bigger bets on hard-to-achieve outcomes. The tradeoff is often ownership and control for the founders, and if proven wrong, the outcome is layoffs, forced exits, and burned and angry employees and customers. Fundstrapping is about using capital as a tool to best serve all stakeholders — customers, employees and owners. The strap ratio is what we call the ratio of total capital raised to ARR, and it’s a key metric we use to understand how well we’re using capital to build our business. Over time, your total capital raised should fall well below your ARR, with subsequent fundraising supporting calculated bets to grow. Fundstrapping is a way to get your company all of the benefits of outside funding — while minimizing your exposure to the downsides.
Raising any money for your business creates risks.  Every time you take on capital, you raise the bar for where you need to go. The more capital you raise, the higher the bar gets, and the more risks you have to take to meet the bar. Early on, when your strap ratio is 11,000% (or “NaN” — Not a Number if you just tried to divide your total money raised by $0 in revenue), you’re gambling. You’re throwing everything you have into a product idea and seeing what happens. We’ve all seen companies continue to raise big rounds to double down again and again on their initial bet. They often don’t have the details figured out or they’re making big assumptions. By raising a big round,
The sad part is that this means companies often fail totally unnecessarily. Their underlying ideas are sound, but they bet too big with funding rounds that are out of proportion with their traction as measured by ARR. They overexpose themselves to risk. Then, their employees and their customers end up bearing the brunt of it when those businesses close up shop. As your product matures and your ARR grows, betting everything on red becomes irresponsible. Customers rely on your company to continue existing. This is doubly true for Customer.io, which has become critical email infrastructure for thousands of companies.
As we’ve added more customers and grown the business, we’ve benefited from being able to invest more capital than our monthly revenue supported.  We learned the downside of not raising money the hard way. For all of 2014, we underspent on the company and the business suffered as a result. We increased ARR by 20x in 2013, but we only grew it by 2.5x in 2014 when we had the potential to grow considerably faster. In early 2014, our infrastructure was groaning under the pressure of rapid growth and we allowed our cash constraints to keep us from hiring quickly enough to serve our customers best.  In early 2015, we raised more money, grew the team 3x and made sure we focused on customers 100%. We’ve continued to raise money, but each time we’ve needed to raise a smaller percentage of revenue in each subsequent raise in order to achieve our goals.  SaaS businesses are like snowballs rolling down a hill. They’re hard to get started, and that’s where the first round of funding really helps. It can buy you a year and change to build the product and get your first few customers. Once SaaS companies get rolling, they build more and more momentum over time. They need less funding in proportion to the snowball’s size to propel it forward. Once the snowball is big enough, it becomes nearly unstoppable.
With fundstrapping, capital is a tool to serve customers and grow your business. It’s not a scarce resource that you need to optimize for as with bootstrapping, nor is it a means to the end of attracting even more capital as with the traditional VC model.
What you’re looking for is a healthy balance between capital raised and the size of your business. By reducing cash as a constraint, you make sure your focus is always on the customer. By minimizing dependence on outside capital, you ensure that you always have a path to profitability, and that means that you control your own destiny to build the company that you want to build. At Customer.io, we’ve developed these strap ratio benchmarks to help us decide when and how much to raise.

The world has moved on from old clunky desktop software. Cloud software-as-a-service is the name of the game. There is a whole lot of competition, and a great UI/UX is more important than ever in making your app stand out from the crowd.
This article is a primer on what issues you should be focusing on, and how we at Zoho have made our UX better over a long period of experimentation and learning.
Layout: A user interface has a lot of things, and how you put them together in a way that makes sense is what we call layout. With new trends, new user habits and multiple devices to consider, nailing a good layout is crucial to the usability of your app.
Product Workflow: I need to get something done. How do I do it? The less time it takes, the more UX points we win.
Visual Design: It’s no longer enough that products just work. They need to look beautiful too. There was a time when this wasn’t really a requirement. But right now, if your product ain’t beautiful, it ain’t gonna be used.
Forms: Forms are a huge, necessary evil. Nobody likes creating them. Nobody likes filling them out. But we can’t live without them. And that’s why making them easier to fill is something every UX designer needs to do.
Zoho Books has been around for a long time, and has experienced a full transition over the years from outdated UI elements to new, modern ones. At Zoho, we’ve conducted extensive usability tests for each and every change, and learned a lot in the process.
Trust me when I say that usability tests are super-important in knowing what changes you make are for the better. You can always start with testing your product with your own employees/colleagues as your test subjects!
“Your employee experience is where your customer experience begins.”

If you’re a regular user of today’s SaaS applications, you would have noticed that more and more products are moving towards a left-hand side navigation, compared to the old trend of using tabbed navigation right at the very top. This is better for usability, and there are a couple of solid reasons for that.
Left-hand side navigation is not something that’s really new. We’ve been using it for ages in Windows Explorer and Finder on the Mac. Moving this over to online SaaS applications is a positive move that’s awesome for users everywhere.
Another unconsidered issue that I’d like to propose is why we don’t use left-hand side navigation on websites. While this has been increasingly prevalent on online apps, moving to left-hand side navigation on websites should surely improve usability by a great degree.
A three-column layout is natural extension of the now common sidebar navigation. With three columns, you have a really easy way to show a list of items in the second column, which can be manipulated easily. A selected item in the second column will show up naturally in the column on the right.
Ah, forms! They are boring, but so necessary. As clever UX designers, we have a whole lot of tricks up our sleeve to make the form-filling experience as easy as it possibly can be. That means going beyond standard browser form elements and coming up with your own, custom forms.
Check out Luke Wroblewski’s Best Practices for Form Design to get a primer on making forms better. This article was written way back in 2008, but the principles proposed here are grounded in human psychology and are still being followed.
Here are just some of the ways we have customised our forms and made them a little less boring, and a little more intuitive to fill out.
Contextually searching a drop down list: Boo for scanning through a huge drop-down list to find what you need. To make things faster, we’ve incorporated search right into the drop-down menu.
Contextually adding new list items: We’ve included an option to add a new customer right from within the drop-down list. Clicking this brings up a pop-up menu which you can use to create the new customer right then and there, without having to go to a separate screen.
Hiding Optional Form Fields: When creating a customer in Zoho Books, there are a lot of fields that are optional. We’ve hidden them in separate tabs to make the interface less cluttered.
Improving Readability and Focus: Readability is a huge factor in making your form easier to fill out. We’ve meddled a lot with the colors and the focus on the form fields to make the whole experience look as smooth as possible.
You can use more of that abundant horizontal screen space by introducing a right sidebar, which you can use for contextual settings related to the item that is currently selected.
When a user needs to get something done in your app, make the experience seem as linear as possible. This means that you have to contextualize each and every “side-task” involved in the process, and not send them off to separate settings screens.
For example, here’s how we have contextualized creating goods/services items right when the user is creating an invoice for said goods/services in Zoho Books.
A great UX, and by extension a great app, is all about implementing these little tricks that make the product just a little bit better.
We’ve designed the skeleton for the app and it works brilliantly for all the apps we have — Zoho Books, Zoho Invoice, Zoho Expense, Zoho Subscriptions and the new upcoming Zoho Inventory.
If you’re working on multiple apps in the same domain, then this approach helps to bring in the consistency which so many others lack.
I hope this will help you to ensure better User Experience in your product designs. Feel free to share your views and suggestions.
Recently, we have enhanced our Expense Tracking Software — Zoho Expense to suit the requirements of Modern Day Enterprise Businesses.

https://medium.com/senovovc/the-key-b2b-saas-metrics-every-start-up-should-track-7ab75222a336?source=search_post---------145,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
When we started a due diligence (at least one call with a founder) in the last 5 years we experienced that many young companies/founders do not prioritize tracking their most important B2B SaaS KPIs in a useful and insightful way. This, however, hinders a good management of the company as well as a fruitful and smooth exchange with potential investors at a later stage. Thus, we would like to give some insights into what we think are the most important KPIs every young B2B SaaS company should start tracking as soon as revenue streams arise from first customers. This allows a good understanding of the own business model, gives insights on how to improve sales and saves a lot of work before or during fundraising. Investors also like to see historic numbers — thus, we suggest starting early.
An important KPI describing the stage of a B2B SaaS company is surely its monthly recurring revenue (MRR) being the sum of the total recurring licence revenue normalized (i.e. deferred) into a monthly account. Although this seems to be a no-brainer there are a few details we would like to highlight. It’s important that the MRR only includes software-related license revenues. Other revenue streams (pilots, PoCs, one-time payments, services, onboarding, consulting, …) even if they might have a recurring character (like service revenues sometimes) are not included in this KPI and should be reported separately.
It’s also enlightening and avoids reporting confusion to track and report both, signed/contracted/committed MRR (sometimes referred to as CMRR, for a signed contract) as well as invoiced MRR (IMRR). Especially for companies with long onboarding times CMRR is an important KPI in order to correctly assess sales reps performance and observe future cash streams. We suggest either reporting both (IMRR and CMRR) or highlighting what is reported, since with long onboarding times and strong growth both KPIs might deviate strongly.
You should also reflect contracted churn (e.g. a customer doesn’t renew a license that ends in 3 months) or upsells that you already know of.
The MRR growth (Net New MRR) is the difference between MRRs. It’s an important KPI but might be misleading if reported independently since it incorporates new customers, upgrades/upsells, downgrades and churns (compare Figure 1 blue line). It thus aggregates lost as well as gained revenue. Hence, it’s useful to also track the Gross New MRR (sum of new MRR and upsell, green in Figure 1) as it gives you better insights on the overall sales performance.
The historic and actual total MRR is the KPI most investors are interested in. We suggest either tracking and plotting it in 2 separate graphs (new MRR and total MRR) or merge both information as e.g. shown in Figure 2.
Many companies also report an ARR. In a B2B SaaS business model only license fees are included, so if you use this metric be sure to calculate it by ARR = 12xMRR. However, keep in mind, that this metric doesn’t give you insights on last or next year’s performance since it doesn’t incorporate growth or churn.
Some companies also report an ACV (annual contract value), which is calculated as the total contract value of a customer normalized into a yearly account. It is a useful metric on a customer basis as well as averaged over all customers, since it informs you about the per customer earnings in one year. However, there is again no real definition, which often leads to confusion. Some companies include non-recurring fees, some don’t. We suggest reporting the ACV as the (average) contract value including all revenue streams, normalized into one year. For contracts larger than one year, the first years ACV might be higher, since one-time fees presumably only occur in the first year.
The TCV is the total contract value of a customer including recurring license fees and all non-recurring fees. Here is one example:
Customer A has a 3 year contract of 36k€ software license fee, 1k€ onboarding fee, 3k€ consulting fee in the first year
TCV= 36k€ + 1k€ + 3k€ = 40k€
ARR=36k€/3 = 12k€
MRR = ARR/12 = 1k€
ACV (first year) = 12k€ + 1k€ + 3k€ = 16k€
ACV (second&third year) = ARR
The customer life time value (LTV or CLTV) is also an important KPI to track. It sums the amount of revenues that you can expect from one customer during its engagement with the company. This is especially important when you expect customers to engage longer than the minimum contract length, else the LTV equals TCV.
In order to prevent confusion, we suggest reporting MRR (rather than ARR), contract lengths, and other revenue streams separately, as mentioned above.
Another important SaaS KPI is the churn rate — both, logo (customers) and MRR churn. However, although being extremely important we experienced that this metric leads to most confusion. Without a detailed definition of your calculation the churn rate is not very valuable in our opinion.
Logo Churn — according to our experience companies calculate, report and understand the logo churn rate in different ways. The aforementioned difference between “contracted” churn (a customer cancelled its contract but might still be live) and live churn (a customer doesn’t pay any more) is as important to be aware of. Calculating live logo churn by dividing through all customers might lead to misleading results, since many customers are often not churnable — depending on the typical contract length of your business. E.g. if one out of hundred customers churned in a month you could easily report 1% monthly logo churn, however if only 5 customers were able to churn (due to contract terms) this number is misleading. You should better report 20% (cohort) logo churn as this number gives you a better proxy for possible future churns (and report your calculation in a footnote). Although for mature companies the monthly- and cohort churn rate should be roughly equal, they may differ significantly for high growth companies. Thus — especially for fast growing companies — it’s more enlightening and powerful to report churn rates based on cohorts.
See Figure 3 and Figure 4 for an example. A B2B SaaS company gained 100 and lost 20 customers in 10 months. The minimum contract length is 3 months. Some companies would report 3% average monthly logo churn. However, this calculation is misleading for this company as it’s not based on cohorts. See Figure 4 for a comparison calculation.
In the following table, the exact cohort calculation of the churn rate is shown below. The different calculations lead to completely different results (3% vs. 8% average monthly churn).
Another good way to track and report logo churn is in cohorts split over the lifetime as shown in Figure 4. With that, you gain information on the time most customer churn. This might help you improving your product and/or contract conditions as well as your customer success strategy. In this example you see, that most customers churn after 3 months, which is the minimum contract length. You can also see that the March cohort is worst.
Revenue Churn Rate — for the MRR churn calculation, you sum up the MRR of the churned customers and divide it by the sum of the MRR of all churnable customers. The calculations are similar to the aforementioned logo churn calculations. More enlightening (in combination with the aforementioned logo churn) however, is the net MRR churn, which includes up-sales and downgrades. It informs you how crucial the logo churn is, as a negative net MRR churn e.g. is a good indicator for a successful business model.
Another important KPI you should track and report as early as possible is your liquidity planning including burn and cash out date. Ideally these calculations are based on the operating KPIs like churn, ACV, sales metrics, headcount payments etc. In order to do so we strongly suggest building a comprehensive financial model including a plan for the next 2–4 years. This should always be driven by key inputs like marketing spending and conversions (for a more inbound sales approach) or by the amount of sales reps and quotas (for a more outbound sales approach). You can find a very good and detailed plan elaborated by our colleague Andi here: https://medium.com/senovovc/b2b-saas-financial-model-v2-0-c10ff5d424b
To get a good feeling of your next months’ growth you should also be aware of your sales pipeline and sales funnel. Both are important, and the difference is small but crucial. The sales pipeline gives you the value and the amount of deals at this reporting date at a specific stage (lead, qualification, …., until closing and implementation). It gives you insights on what deals you or your sales reps are working on and what the potential outcome of those deals is. You should always compare the pipeline with your targets from the financial model or ideally connect both in order to keep track and implement an early warning system if things don’t work out as expected.
The sales funnel gives you insights on the conversion rates of prospects at each pipeline stage. It is based on past actions and is thus always a cohort analysis. E.g. it can tell you how your conversions performed in the last year at each stage of the pipeline. It gives you good insights which steps to optimize within the sales process.
Lastly, track your sales cycle in days as it is a good indicator of how fast you can scale your business.
Another important metric you should track is the customer acquisition cost (CAC), being the sum of all sales and marketing spending (including salaries, bonuses, rent, cars etc.) divided by the number of new customers in a given time period. It’s the key metric of how valuable a customer should be to create a profitable business. It also allows you to calculate how long it will take to turn a customer breakeven when you subtract one-time revenues and divide it by the MRR (i.e. payback-time). The payback time should not drastically exceed 12 months (depending on retention) as your business growth else consumes too much capital. A good SaaS business model is driven by a CLTV that exceeds the CAC significantly (at least 3 times).
If you have a more inbound sales approach try to separately report CAC for paid and non-paid leads, as a blended metric might lead to confusion. E.g. if you have 10 paid leads that turn into 1 customer and 10 unpaid leads that turn into 2 customers, the blended conversion would be 15%. However, it’s more insightful to report both conversions separately (paid: 10%, unpaid, 20%). A reporting based on each marketing and sales channel is even more comprehensive if data is available.
First, we suggest founders to build a decent reporting which allows for tracking the aforementioned most important B2B SaaS KPIs. Second, build a decent financial plan which is driven by sales and/or marketing spending. This plan should optimally lead to the same KPIs so you can benchmark your progress and review your assumptions on a monthly basis. The goal is not to hit the plan 100%. Start-up reality is that you almost certainly will be above or below plan. But it is important to know when and where you deviate and what the short- and long-term deviations are. Also keep in mind your reporting needs and how you can create these as efficiently as possible.
However, there is no right or wrong and there are no fixed definitions on B2B SaaS KPIS.
Whatever you track, make sure to later present it in an easy to understand and favourable way to prevent confusion. A good way to do so is by defining your KPI calculations, e.g. in a footnote of the investors presentation.
If you don’t want to track everything manually (in excel) there are some good tools out there to help you out, e.g. https://chartmogul.com, https://www.profitwell.com, https://www.saasoptics.com/, or https://www.chargebee.com. This might simplify your reporting efforts drastically and the communication with (potential) investors, since most KPIs are already tracked, calculated and continuously updated.
If you have any comments or you are even building an amazing SaaS start-up: we would love to hear from you at pitch at senovo dot vc!

Logos of High-growth SaaS IPOs in 2018:
2018 was a banner year for high-growth software companies going public. There were almost 20 in total and 16 high-growth software names, of which 14 made it to the public markets (Qualtrics and Adaptive Insights were acquired before trading). While I’ve done S-1 write-ups on almost all of these, I thought it would be interesting to benchmark various stats and KPIs from each company. While there are hundreds of total variables, I outputted some relevant stats in the following sections and summarized below.
Years to IPO; Founding Year to IPO Year
Firstly, how long did it take? The below chart has years from founding to IPO year. The median is 14 years. Note the scale of these companies varies widely (more in next section).
LTM (last-twelve-months) Revenue at IPO Quarter ($M)
All of these companies have meaningful scale and the median LTM revenue is $192M. Dropbox is a huge outlier at ~$1.1B of LTM revenue.
IPO Quarter Total Revenue YoY Growth Rate
Even at scale, these companies are growing quickly. The median growth rate is almost 40% year-over-year for this group. 4 out of the 16 companies were growing over 50% YoY.
Subscription / Recurring Revenue as a % of Total Revenue
While all these companies have subscription models, only a couple have 100% of their revenue subscription or recurring in nature. The below benchmarks LTM subscription or recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue. The median is 90%. The other 10% is mostly comprised of professional services.
Implied ARR at IPO Quarter ($M)
While none of these companies report ARR (annual recurring revenue), it can be derived by multiplying quarterly subscription revenue * 4. Again, Dropbox is a huge outlier but every company is over $100M of implied ARR with the median at $203M.
Implied Net New ARR at IPO Quarter ($M)
The median YoY % growth rate for ARR is ~39% and the below benchmarks how much net new ARR each company added (difference in subscription revenue * 4) at IPO quarter. The median net add is ~$18M.
LTM GAAP Gross Margin
Now looking at the P&L and specifically gross margin, the median for this group is 73%.
LTM GAAP Operating Margin
Almost every company is losing money on an operating-basis (except Qualtrics) and the median LTM GAAP operating margin is ~(29)%. Domo was significantly in the red (more on their cash burn below).
Net Dollar Retention / Expansion
Expansion is a critical metric for any SaaS company and while some of these businesses have slightly different definitions, they’re benchmarked below. The median is 117%. For a full list, see this link.
Average Subscription Revenue per Customer (Average ACVs or Annual Contract Value)
Companies typically don’t report detailed customer segment information so it’s hard to know exactly how much all their customers are paying, but we do have averages. The below benchmarks annualized subscription revenue over total customers at IPO quarter. The median is $32.5K. Dropbox, by far the largest company in this group, has the smallest ACVs of $111.
Total Full-time Employees (FTEs) at IPO Quarter
The scale of revenue varies widely in this group and so does the employee base. The below benchmarks total employees at IPO quarter. The median is almost 1,000.
LTM Revenue per Full-time Employee
While the amount of employees is interesting to look at, the revenue per FTE might be more important. Each company has a different product, market, delivery model, price, end-customer, etc., but it’s not a surprise that Dropbox, which has a consumer-like and self-serve go-to-market, generates the most revenue on a per employee basis. The median is ~$190K per FTE.
Sales Efficiency: Implied Months to Payback
It’s hard to benchmark precise customer acquisition costs since most companies don’t report new customer adds, but it’s possible to standardize and find the months to payback using a CAC ratio (implied net new ARR * gross margin / sales and marketing spend of prior quarter). It’s no surprise Elastic and Dropbox, both with self-serve go-to-markets, are the most efficient. Elastic is also the fastest growing company in this group with almost 80% YoY revenue growth. The median months to payback is ~30.
Total Equity Capital Raised ($M)
All of these businesses were venture-backed. The below benchmarks include total equity capital raised in the private markets. The median is $300M.
Implied Cash Burn to IPO ($M)
Scaling a software company is expensive, and each of these companies burned through significant amounts of money to reach IPO scale. The below benchmarks implied burn — cash on the balance sheet at IPO quarter minus total equity capital raised. Some of the venture capital dollars were likely secondary, which is not reported, but the below should be close. The median burn for this group to was ~$215M. More cash lifecycle data here.
Valuation — Market Cap at IPO ($M)
14 out of these 16 companies made it to trading and the median market cap at pricing was almost $2B. Moreover, Qualtrics was acquired for $8B and Adaptive Insights was acquired for $1.6B days before their respective offerings.
IPO Size ($M)
Each company also raised significant dollars from the public markets to add to their balance sheets. The median offering size was $255M.
Post-IPO Stock Performance
Each company started trading in 2018, and while many are still in the lock-up period, it’s interesting to look at performance to date. The fastest-growing companies are being rewarded the most in the public markets thus far.
EV / NTM Revenue Multiples
In most cases, high-growth software companies are valued on a multiple of forward revenue. The below benchmarks enterprise value over NTM (next-twelve-months) revenue. The median is ~7x.
Forward Revenue Growth
These businesses are growing revenue quickly and their valuation multiple is obviously highly correlated with growth. The below benchmarks NTM (next-twelve-month) growth rates — the median is ~26%.
What did it take to IPO as a SaaS company in 2018?
To make it public as a SaaS company in 2018, you have been around almost 15 years, are ~$200M+ in ARR and growing ~40%, have ~75% GAAP gross margins, are losing money, have a 120% net dollar expansion rate, sell a ~$30K product, have almost 1,000 employees, have raised $300M from investors (and burned through at least $200M of it), and sold over $250M of stock in an IPO at a valuation of ~$2B! And in a short period of time, you’re up 25%+ from IPO price.
Of the 14 high-growth SaaS companies that traded this year, they raised a cumulative $4.9B in the public markets, a staggering number. 2018 saw almost double the amount of SaaS IPOs than 2017, and there are dozens of SaaS unicorns in the private markets. It’s clear public market investors are eager to invest in high-growth software assets and I have no doubt the flurry of S-1 filings will continue in 2019.

The pain point that every single B2B company shares is pricing.
Countless philosophies flood the web on how to price your product (just see here, here, and here). More than 500 pricing products and services are offered in the tech space. All of this points to the fact that, when it comes to pricing, most people don’t know what they’re doing.
For a long time, neither did we.
Pricing is inherently risky because your revenue depends on getting it right. Yet there isn’t one de facto strategy that works. Mailchimp has had great success with their freemium pricing plan, which businesses can stay on forever. While CampaignMonitor — a functionally similar tool — has no free tier and scales their pricing according to email volume along with features.
At Front we learned the hard way that there’s no silver bullet for pricing. More importantly, we found a way to constantly improve our pricing: here’s how we de-risked our pricing strategy.
When we were first developing our pricing strategy, we were very concerned about getting it right. We didn’t want to price ourselves out of the market, but we didn’t want to undervalue the tool we were so proud of building. Like many other companies, we didn’t want to make the wrong decision and be pigeon-holed as a certain type of brand.
After much deliberation, we ended up starting with a freemium plan, hoping to get our name out there and get some good feedback on the product.
[Front’s first ever pricing page]
After getting some initial traction, we continued on a similar trajectory to many other freemium SaaS companies — we went upmarket. We dropped our free plan and added a “tailored” enterprise plan, hoping to catch a few big fish.
[Front’s pricing page, v.2]
In the course of two years we only changed our pricing three times. Each time, we factored in all the details we were told were important:
We were constantly second-guessing ourselves — did we want to go cheap for the masses, or expensive for the few? Were we delivering more value than our pricing indicated? Should we focus more on that top 20% of customers that contribute to 80% of our revenue? These are questions that gnaw on practically every startup team.
We weren’t wrong to be considering all these questions, but every change in our pricing felt like a huge risk. Because we changed pricing so infrequently, we could never tell how customers might react. Once or twice we tried to make a big change, but when the numbers dropped we’d quickly change it back. We needed to find a way to improve pricing more quickly and with less risk.
It was after a chat with the team at Intercom about eight months ago that we realized the obvious: iterating on pricing more frequently would give us more data on what works and what doesn’t. So instead of changing prices once a year, we decided to get experimental.
We set aside three weeks for our developers to make some internal adjustments to make pricing changes easier. We needed our software to give us the flexibility to experiment quickly and often. Naturally it cost us resources up front, but the investment was well worth it.
We went from iterating once a year to once every three weeks. Now when we make changes, we compare the new cohort to the previous ones: if the cohorts behave similarly or the new one is even better, we stick with the new pricing plan. If not, we just roll back to a pricing structure that’s worked well previously.
The best part about the experimental approach is that it’s safe. Because we test on small cohorts, there are fewer repercussions for totally screwing up. So instead of making big, infrequent jumps in our pricing, we evolve our pricing little by little at a steady cadence.
With every iteration, we have a better sense of how our customers value our product. Our experiments are also what led us to discover that even enterprise clients want to see a number on our pricing page:
[Front’s pricing page v. 20]
A lot of people fear changing pricing too often because they think it will scare away their customers. And for some — that might be true. But never experimenting with your pricing means you may never learn the value of your product and its potential for growth.
We don’t have pricing all figured out. But we have found a low-risk way to experiment and get closer to our optimal pricing point — and we thought that alone was worth sharing. Here is how our pricing page looks like now.
To build your own experimental pricing strategy, you need more than just numbers and spreadsheets. You need to focus on behavioral and revenue data and find a way to group and compare that data over time.
Start by nailing down your “value metric” — what your customers are paying for. This can be something like number of videos hosted, inboxes created, or reports processed. You can gather that info from simple surveys sent out to your customers, either through email or in-app.
From there, decide how often you want to experiment (we recommend no longer than every two months). At each iteration pay attention to how the use of your value metric has grown. Maybe people were hosting 10 videos on your platform but are now hosting 100 — that means you should raise your pricing accordingly.
At the end of each period, compare the cohorts and pay particular attention to:
If you don’t have the time or dev resources to build an analytics tool in-house, consider hooking up to a third-party tool like Amplitude. You can group users based on cohort and look at views that compare each cohort’s behaviors. Every test you perform will point you toward better pricing choices without risking your entire revenue for the month.

As someone who loves cutting-edge technology, I choose to build my first SaaS with a modern tech stack. With the rise of JAMStack and serverless architecture, I created PostMage with Next JS static generation for the frontend and the Node.js backend deployed to AWS.
Because I’m a solo full-stack developer, my time and resources are extremely limited. In this article, I’ll share all the technologies I use to build my SaaS product: from programming language to development tools. You’ll find how I overcome this challenge to build a SaaS as a solo developer.
Hope my story gives you inspiration to create your SaaS products.
For building my SaaS, I wrote every line of code in TypeScript. Yes, all the code: Frontend, Backend and also, Infrastructure as code in TypeScript.
The whole project only uses one and unique programming language. No time to learn new languages and save time by making the code easy to maintain.
Why did I choose TypeScript? It makes the development much more pleasant with strongly-typed and has better integration to IDE. So, if you are still a JavaScript developer, you should give it a try.
For the frontend, I use Next.js. It’s a React framework to build a complex application. The good news, Next JS supports TypeScript out-of-the-box.
I use Tailwind CSS styling the React components. As a developer, you usually build an ugly interface. With Tailwind CSS, you can have now build a not so ugly interface even if you aren’t a designer.
As a true believer of JAMStack, I have previously taken some time to try Jekyll, Hexo and 11ty for different projects. I choose to build my SaaS in static generated mode using Next JS. So, at build time, all the pages are generated and pre-rendered. Perfect for SEO, cheap hosting, fast, secure and highly scalable.
I use Cloudflare Pages as a hosting service for the frontend, it’s a brand new alternative to Netlify or Vercel. Cloudflare has announced it in December 2020 in beta and released it to the public in April 2021.
There is some small missing feature (nothing big) in Pages. Until the Cloudflare team solve it, I’ve found temporary workarounds. So, it isn’t a big deal.
The good thing about Cloudflare Page is its generous free tier: unlimited bandwidth (Vercel and Netlify are limited to 100GB per month) and you can set up a password-protected website for free (not included for free in Vercel or Netlify).
On the backend side, I’ve built a REST API with Express.js and Serverless Framework. To support TypeScript in Serverless Framework, I use serverless-bundle plugin. Express.js needs another plugin to work with Serverless Framework named serverless-http.
For better developer experience, I’ve also used two other plugins: serverless-dotenv-plugin and serverless-offline. The first plugin is to support dotenv files and the second one is to run Serverless Framework on your local computer.
As a solo developer, I choose serverless architecture for making my life easier with easy deployment, low maintenance and scalable backend. No need to become a DevOps engineer: no need to SSH, make OS updates, configure proxy/webserver/load balancer/firewall, etc.
The REST API is protected by the IAM authentication. It’s AWS built-in feature to secure any AWS resources, in our case, API gateway and AWS lambda. It denies the API invocation when the user isn’t connected to the SaaS application. So, when it’s protected, external actors won’t be able to invoke your resource.
Because the API is deployed to AWS, I choose to use AWS Cognito for authentication. The good thing is that Cognito saves a lot of time by providing everything you need to implement authentication for your SaaS. You get access without any effort to Email authentication and Social sign-in (Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon).
The connection between AWS Cognito and React frontend is done through AWS Amplify. Amplify provides React components and code for making your frontend integration to AWS easier and faster.
Major and well-known databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL don’t fit very well in Serverless architecture. Due to the nature of serverless, it can create a lot of connections to the database and exhaust the database connection limit.
On most providers, even if you don’t have any traffic on your SaaS, you still need to pay your DB instance. On the opposite, when your application starts to grow, your database can quickly become the bottleneck.
As a solo full-stack developer, I wanted something extremely easy to manage and 100% compatible with serverless. So, I choose DynamoDB as a primary database.
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database fully managed by AWS and I use it to store user states. They almost handle everything and I just need to focus on my code.
As you can see, I use several AWS services for my SaaS app. It’s extremely painful to set up manually cloud resources in each environment (development, staging or production) and hard to maintain consistency between them.
AWS gives developers access to AWS CDK where you can define your cloud resources in TypeScript. In one command, you can deploy to your AWS account and get everything provisioned.
Like many developers, I use Git and GitHub for version control of my code. Many modern hosting services like Vercel and Netlify, Cloudflare pages automatically build and deploy your code at each commit. If you work with Git branches, you can also live preview the results without pushing to production.
For the backend and the infrastructure, I use a third-party service named Seed.run to deploy automatically at each commit. Like the frontend, it also builds and deploys the backend resources on AWS.
As you can doubt, I use Cloudflare for DNS and CDN without any surprise ;) Cloudflare Pages automatically deploy your code in the Cloudflare network, I only need to point my domain to Cloudflare DNS server and they handle the rest. Using Cloudflare, you get plenty of security features like a firewall and a DDoS protection for your SaaS products.
I use Sentry as the error tracking solution. It automatically reports when something goes wrong with useful information like stack trace, breadcrumbs (a trail of events that happened before an issue), browser information, OS information, etc. It makes debugging in production much easier with enriched data:
Sentry is only set up for the frontend and not for the REST API, I keep using the native solution. Indeed, Sentry with AWS lambda creates a lot of overhead and the setup wasn’t straightforward. In the next section, you’ll find the solution I use for error tracking in the backend.
AWS Lambda automatically sends logs to AWS CloudWatch, so no need to use Sentry. Here is an example of logs stored in CloudWatch:
You also get access to your lambda metrics. Perfect to understand how your serverless functions behave and detect if there are any errors.
I also use Lumigo to have additional information for my logging and monitoring. The interface is easier to use compared to Cloudwatch:
You can also enable tracing in Lumigo where you can visualize your AWS service and external API calls. It makes your debugging session easier by letting you know if there is an error in your code or it’s from an external service.
The last piece of a SaaS and the most important thing for a business is to accept payment. Accepting a one-time payment is hard but, the task for recurrent payment is much complex. Unfortunately, for a SaaS business, we need to handle the second case.
Your customers need to choose the plan and enter their personal information when they subscribe for the first time.
After that, your users should have a self-service portal where they can manage their plan: upgrade, downgrade, cancel, pause, resume their subscription plan.
They sometimes also need to update their personal information. And, they also need access to their invoice history when needed.
Stripe can manage everything I mention in this section, it hides all these complexities and makes the integration to payment easier.
It took me 5 months of development to build this full-stack React SaaS template. Instead of focusing on my business, I was solving these technical details. Building the first version of your SaaS should only take 1 month and not 5.
By going through this long journey, I’ve learned so many things and I’ve made tons of mistakes. I hope others developers won’t do the same mistakes, so I build Nextless JS, React Boilerplate for SaaS products.
With Nextless.js, you get everything I mentioned in this article without you writing any line of code. Save you time, focus on things that matter and launch your SaaS faster. Find more information at Nextless JS.

Building products without spending thousands of dollars.
Last October I launched ipdata.co — an IP Geolocation API — and my first SaaS. My plan at the time was to throw as much up against the wall as I could and narrow my focus to what sticks.
To brace myself for the expected long haul, I planned to spend as little time and money as possible on each idea. Only spending money on an idea once I had at least one paying customer.
In doing this I’ve found numerous products whose free tiers alone made it viable to actually build entire products on them without spending a dollar.
What you can do with this
With API Gateway and AWS Lambda, you get 1M free API Gateway calls (first 12 months), 1M Lambda function executions and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute every month forever! Beyond that the Pricing is pretty favorable at $3.50 per million API Gateway requests and $0.20 per million lambda function invocations.
Note that if the product you’re building is a long-running process you might find Lambda expensive as you’ll get charged by execution time and the resources assigned to the lambda function for that period.
This setup has scaled favorably for us and we’ve been able to serve 25M API requests from 10 regions globally for a little over $100!
This setup has scaled favorably for us and we’ve been able to serve 25M API requests from 10 regions globally for a little over $100!
2. Scalable Databases
Dynamodb is a fast and highly scalable NoSQL offering from AWS. The Non-expiring free tier gives 25 GB of Storage, 25 Units of Read Capacity and 25 Units of Write Capacity — enough to handle up to 200M requests!
You can use Dynamodb as a Key-Value store or to store JSON documents. If you’ve worked with Mongodb or Redis the shift to Dynamodb should feel natural.
3. User Management (Sign Up, Login with Email and SMS verification)
You’ll never have to code another user management system again in your life! AWS Cognito gives you all the functionality you need to allow users to sign up, login, verify their emails and phones, use MFA and more for free!
Up to 50 000 users!
Beyond 50 000 users the price is tiered with $0.00550 per user for the next 50000.
4. Your HTTPs website (S3 + Cloudfront/Netlify + AWS Certificate Manager)
You want a static website.
You can use javascript to add a level of interaction and dynamic content to the page. But with a static site you get;
For this setup you’d use
S3
A data storage service that you can use to serve HTML pages for a simple website. You get 5 GB of Amazon S3 standard storage, 20,000 Get Requests, and 2,000 Put Requests but only for the first year (if you’re still running after a year you should be making money and okay with paying)
Cloudfront
Cloudfront is a Content Delivery Network, it caches your site pages so that subsequent users can access your site faster without having to read from S3. You get 50 GB Data Transfer Out, 2,000,000 HTTP and HTTPS Requests every month for your first year.
Amazon Cerficate Manager gives you unlimited fully managed SSL certificates. Renewals are automated and you can use these in front of your S3 website or for anything else for which you might need SSL certificates.
Netlify is incredibly popular with developers, it offers a Global CDN, Continuous Deployment, one click HTTPS, tight integration with git, Traffic Split Testing, Instant cache invalidation, Instant rollbacks and Infinite scaling!
Their free tier is incredibly inclusive and includes;
Sendgrid
AWS Cognito will handle sending all your forgotten password or verification emails.
For Email Newsletters and Promotional Emails look at Sendgrid.
Their free tier is 100 emails/day and 2000 marketing contacts.
Beyond the free tier it costs you $9.95/month to send 40, 000 emails.
Mailchimp
Mailchimp’s Free Forever plan allows you to send 12,000 emails per month to up to 2,000 subscribers.
Beyond that you get unlimited sending starting at $20 and are billed according to the number of subscribers
Stripe is stupidly simple to integrate and start collecting subscriptions.
There’s the ubiquitous pop-up
And the recently announced (and beautiful!) pre-designed checkout forms.
See them all in action here.
The best part; you don’t get billed unless you’re making money.
Drift
You’ve probably seen one of those chat pop-ups on the internet. Good news! All you have to do to add one to your site is add a Javascript snippet to the pages you want it to appear on! For free! If you need more than one person handling support then you’ll need a team plan. But if you’re a solo indie maker you’re good to go!
I’ve had dozens of conversations with customers I wouldn’t have otherwise had thanks to drift. When users see that little widget pop up with a “How can we help?”, they respond. It’s effortless to slide into a conversation with a prospect.
I strongly believe that a lot of the conversations I’ve had have directly led to sales.
Fullstory
Watch how your users interact with your site with session replay by fullstory. You’re able to search for all the recordings where for example, users clicked on buy but didn’t checkout or removed certain items from their carts or really if they clicked on any html element you care about!
This is great for spotting UI bugs as you get to see your site as it rendered on the user’s device, you can also directly view the user’s console for errors on the Pro plan.
Chartmogul is a subscriptions analytics service that generates common SaaS metrics for your business, including:
It supports integration with Stripe, BrainTree, Paypal, Chargify and more.
You get beautiful charts that give you insights into how your SaaS is doing.
Their Launch plan is free forever while your MRR is under $10K!
You don’t get charged unless you’re actually making more than $10K!
Namecheap — Get a .com for $10 a year.
Zoho — get a gmail like inbox from which you can send and receive emails from youremail@yourdomain.com
Freshsales
I love Freshsales! The product is beautiful and incredibly intuitive to use with an awesome free plan!
Use it to;
There’re quite a few other products in the Freshworks suite see them all here.
Freshbooks
Another beautiful functional product from Freshworks. It includes; invoicing, time tracking, has both Android and iOS mobile apps and is only $15/month!
Freshdesk
If you’d rather not use email for support tickets checkout Freshdesk
Their Sprout plan is free with basic calling, ticketing and unlimited agents!
Paid plans start at $19 per agent/month billed yearly.
Zeit.co
Deploy your Node.js apps to multiple regions around the world!
Zeit is free for up to 3 deployments. Your code is however visible at /_src on your deployment.
Paid plans start at $15/month for 10 deployments (and your code isn’t exposed).
Usage over the tier you’re on is billed on a pay as you go basis.
Heroku
Run your Python, Ruby, Node, PHP etc apps without having to setup servers.
Heroku’s free offering
512 MB RAM │ 1 web/1 worker
Beyond plans start at $7 per dyno/month.
Use Hyperping.io for uptime monitoring.
Your SaaS is probably still buggy. This gives you a heads up when your product is unreachable, before the angry emails from users.
You can setup SMS and Email notifications. Downtime is also verified from multiple regions to prevent false positives.
If a theme will do, don’t waste time coding a site for a product that might flop.
You can get something decent on Themeforest for ~$20.
If you need custom design work, checkout manypixels.co - unlimited design work for $259 a month. If you’d use it infrequently, a good idea would be to split the cost with a friend! And you can both have a design agency at your disposal for all your projects!
Flaticon
Flaticon for beautiful flat icons.
Apiary gives you beautiful API documentation that you can automatically generate from a Swagger spec file or by hand in markdown!
It also gives you an in-browser console in which your users can test your API with fully working code examples in several languages — all auto-generated!
It’s free plan allows you to access most features you’d need. However if you’d like to have the documentation under a custom domain name or to customize the page to align with your brand then you’d need to sign up for one of their paid plans which start at $99 per month.
Here’s a working example you can play with:
https://ipdata.docs.apiary.io
AWS Activate
If you need more oomph to develop on AWS, checkout AWS Activate.
The Builders plan is the most straightforward to get into as you don’t need to be part of an accelerator.
With this you get;
Microsoft Azure Free Tier
I’m less familiar with Azure’s and GCE’s free tiers but check them out too! If nothing else then for their cloud functions (their equivalent to AWS Lambda).
Lastly for inspiration on your bootstrapping journey, here’s a talk by Jason Cohen of WPEngine that is solid gold :) https://vimeo.com/74338272

I took on the role of Sales VP for my SaaS Startup for 4 months, and here’s how it went. But first, you should know a little bit about me…
As long as I remember myself, I’ve been an engineer. My parents were engineers, my sister and nephews were engineers, my grandfather was an engineer. It shouldn’t surprise you that I was a geek as a kid. Big time. I was frequently found disassembling things like VCRs to understand how they’re working. Other times I was building things and giving them to my parents or friends to suggest improvements. I liked putting a lot of thinking into designing and building things which would have some kind of impact on people’s lives. If something failed, I’d get emotional and try to beat it into shape until it made sense for me and others.
I remember my first ever sales experience like it was yesterday. My uncle Renos owned a store with 20 or so employees which made and sold linen, curtains, etc, and asked me to help him out during the summer. I was 14 at the time, and welcomed with open arms the chance to make some extra pocket money. The job included help with anything under the sun: carrying stuff, hanging curtains in customer’s houses, and (more frequently than anything else) making coffee. What it most definitely didn’t include was sales.
One day, I had to watch the shop for a few minutes without adult supervision. As fate would have it, a customer walks in. She was an elegantly dressed woman in her 50s and I remember her walking with the grace of a member of the royal family. As she was walking in, a feeling of panic hit me like never before. I was suddenly responsible for something of critical importance for my uncle and became engulfed with an overwhelming feeling of accountability. What if she was a hotel manager and needed to place a large order like 800 bed linens? And there I was, a clueless 14 year-old kid fully responsible for helping her.
“May I be of service madam?” I asked, after finding the courage to stand up and slowly walk to her. She looked at me, smiling graciously, clearly recognizing the effort I was making to be professional and courteous, and replied politely, “I’d like to see some silk curtains for my house young gentleman.” We went on and looked at some options, and after 5 or so minutes, I walked her out. As the door closed behind her, along with the pressure of helping her, I was overwhelmed with feelings. My heart was beating fast. It was partly relief, partly a rush of excitement, and partly thinking that I could have done better.
“You did well, son,” said a voice. It was my uncle. He had been watching the whole thing from the deepest corner of the store. He smiled, nodded respectfully, and went back down the staircase to the workshop.
I learned one lesson about sales from my uncle that day. It’s OK not to be certain about what you’re doing the first time. Just give it your best and have fun while at it.
Last September we decided our sales team at Transifex needed a new leader. I gave myself 4 months to find the right VP Sales. Until then, I would jump in and act as our VP Sales.
Until this point, I’d worked mostly with engineers. What was obvious from the start is that salesmen and saleswomen are wired very differently than engineers. You can find similar characteristics between salespeople and athletes — which is why athletes do great in sales. Engineers are, well, almost the opposite of athletes really. Most of the lessons learned during my tenure as the VP Sales at Transifex stems from this observation and are shared below.
For every tens or hundreds of emails and phone calls, there’s a win. While for other people an unanswered email is a failure, something you would get emotional about, for sales it’s part of the process. It’s a numbers game. It’s like a muscle which needs exercise and many repetitions to get stronger and better before lifting the desired weight.
This is why sales teams thrive with activity. But only having a revenue goal is too high-level to manage properly. It needs to be broken down into daily activities that can be quantifiably measured. If you know general conversion rates, it’s easy to hit your numbers by tracking X ops created and Y activity touches per day.
Opportunities created per week is an excellent all-around sales KPI (Key Performance Indicator) to track against: it’s high-level enough to easily correlate to a revenue goal, but low-level enough to understand and measure on a daily basis.
I learned that making the effort, even if there are no visible results, is part of the sales process. It makes you stronger, wiser, and takes you one step closer to your goals.
Some cases are a done-deal. Some need work to help the customer understand the problem and picture how your solution will help them. And some (if not most) are never meant to close.
Here’s what the typical lead probability distribution curve looks like in terms of all deals and how likely they are to close. Each point on the curve represents a specific customer (horizontal axis) and their probability to convert (vertical axis).
We can group the deals in three parts:
On the right side, you’ve got a few deals which are almost certain to close (their probability is close to 1). These companies have a big need, they know you’re a great fit, they have the budget, and they are excited to go through the process of setting things up. You only need to show up to get them through the door. Just don’t screw up.
On the left side, you’ve got a ton of leads that have a very low (<30%) probability to close. Your marketing (lead generation) and sales development teams have the responsibility to nurture those leads and help them until the point in time when they’ll be ready to choose a solution like yours.
And then you have the “Want to buy” section of the curve. It’s those customers who are close, but no cigar. The role of the sales team is to only work on those few customers. Sales is about getting a customer close but yes, with a cigar.
Notice a few things about this part of the curve:
Working on this segment means that you’ll be working on some deals that might be not inherently ready to buy, already sold on another product, or not have a huge need. There is a big chance of losing accounts that you were hoping to close. Others will close for lower amounts than projected.
I learned that losing a deal is part of the process. It’s part of pushing yourself to achieve more than what’s inside your comfort zone, to close deals outside of your “almost certain” zone. Do not dwell on a lost deal. Be grateful you were considered in the first place because it means you’re on the right track. Learn from the process, rinse, and repeat.
Engineers like to be left alone. If you pay too much attention to them, analyze how they’re working, and instruct in relevant skills, you’ll soon start getting angry looks when you approach their desks. Sales teams on the other hand work closely with their leaders, thrive best when given guidance and encouragement because at the end of the day, the constant beating from lost deals should be overshadowed by the celebration, the praise, and the recognition.
If the salespeople’s ABC is “Always Be Closing”, the good sales leader’s is “Always Be Commending”. Always support your team and be there when someone asks for your help. Stop what you are doing and listen. Your team wants to be successful and close that deal as much as you do, or maybe more. And they know what they need to do. Don’t pull a Glengarry Blake speech on them.
And when a deal doesn’t turn out to be as promising as hoped , don’t ask “why didn’t we sign at the higher price we originally discussed?” Getting scolded will only make that team member feel like you’re not appreciating the effort they put into that deal. Instead, offer support and constructive feedback to make the next deal better. Be a champion for your team and show them the way without condemning or complaining because you will not get the true results you want.
Great sales teams are constantly talking, exchanging ideas with one another and laughing out loud with customers on the phone. Loud noises, for the most part, show that your sales team is “in the zone” and it’s actually what you want from your sales team. In our Transifex US office, we have an open space, so the initial reaction was to ask the sales team to tone it down. Wrong move. Let your sales team do what they know to do best.
Excitement and energy in sales teams is contagious. You want your sales team to experience the whole range of emotions, share the effort, celebrate the wins together. You want the gong.
Knowing my background isn’t in sales, I knew that acting as the VP Sales at Transifex would require help, and I strived and believe any leader should strive to:
I acted as the sales VP for Transifex for 4 months and I want to emphasize that “acted” is an apt term for this process. I’ve led many large deals for Transifex since we started, including 6-figure ones, but when I first took on this role, the idea of leading our sales team scared the bejesus out of me. My instinctive feeling was “I’m not made for this. I’m an engineer. It feels so wrong.” Sure, I get excited talking about our product. I can do that for hours. But actually sell? Darn that felt hard.
Now that my tenure as the VP of sales has come to an end, I can confidently say that sales is not for the faint hearted. If I had to rate myself, I’d be generous and give myself a 5/10. I had to learn fast a lot of things: leading and coaching a sales team on a day-by-day basis, running sales ops, forecasting a quarter, setting up comp plans. And I had a lot of conflicting feelings throughout the process.
The engineer inside me was excited to learn something new and understand how another part of the business worked ground-up. The adventurer inside me was thrilled with the opportunity to work outside of my comfort zone and stretch myself. At the same time, I had moments where I felt again insufficient for what the role required. And it’s then I reminded what I learned from my uncle Renos:
“it’s OK not to be certain about what you’re doing the first time. Just give it your best and have fun while at it.”

Top highlight
Pricing is one of the biggest levers that you have in SaaS. The recurring nature of the business model makes any price increase, decrease or discount an important decision.
But at this early stage of your company, the goal of your pricing is not to optimise to make (THE real) money. The goal is to test if customers will pay something that will make your business work.
And your business will work if:
You will always have time to optimize pricing later.
About this seriesThis series of articles are drafted from our experience at Point Nine Capital on the top priorities for early-stage SaaS companies. Note that though more relevant for startups who focus on SMBs first and then go upmarket, the priorities are general enough to apply to most SaaS companies.
Some suggestions here to decide your early pricing for a SaaS biz:
If you’re selling to small businesses, you need to get 100s$ of dollars from them a month to scale. If you sell to medium sized businesses 1000s$ a month. For enterprise, a lot more than that.
When you decide your first pricing, pick a figure relevant to your customer’s size and cost of acquisition.
If you see friction, try to stick to that figure. Instead of lowering the price to get an adoption, refocus the product to provide value to your customers. Keep asking them: “What can I provide you so you pay me xx?”
1 plan + a trial period is better than 2 plans + a trial…. and yes, I know that you should have 3 plans for psychological reasons.
You should think that every pricing tier adds a lot of extra complexity to manage. The more plans, the harder it becomes to understand the different conversion and expansion rates. At this stage you don’t have the resources and understanding of the market to deal with that.
If you can, try to simplify your pricing to a metric that somehow correlates with the value perceived (ie. users/seats).
Remember that the goal today is not to optimise, but rather to check we have a potential business.
Then, try to copy a pricing plan that the potential customers have seen before. You don’t want them to avoid trying your product because they don’t understand your pricing.
Users tend to understand well pricing models in which they can control the input (again, number of seats, data ingested, etc.).
If they sense that the pricing can be uncontrollable, they will probably not even try your product.
Increasing it by even x2 later will be veeery hard. First because you anchored yourself and your customers to a lower price, so there’s a lower perception of value. And second because you will feel scared of rejection and your team will feel it too and push against it.
An exception to this rule is if your product has some kind of product virality — like Slack, Trello, etc.. Then you want as many users as possible, thus it makes sense to lower the price.
The goal of pricing at this stage is to get your customers to pay something relevant. A free plan sometimes makes sense for marketing reasons or to lock-in a market.
If you add a cheaper pricing tier to avoid competitors and become the category leader, don’t do it just now. You can do that later.
On top of that, a freemium plan brings the following challenges
If you can, extend trial periods instead of freemium. Learn why people are not converting —it might be hard to understand the value, your product might have a long on-boarding, etc.
If you don’t limit discounts over time, you are giving away a big chunk of revenue over the life time of a customer. A 20% discount of $1000 month, over 3 years means $7.2k per customer.
Referrals are a great source of leads at this stage.
The person who does the referral is endorsing your product and sharing his “trust”. That helps bring customers.
Pricing is a very complex topic. Those comments are just focused on early stage, because pricing should not be a key area of your focus then — you have higher priorities. But as soon as you get some growth, you should start learning about the elasticity of price and how to capture more of the value you’re generating.
But those are topics for a future post.

Introduction
In the early stages of most B2B SaaS startups life, it is often the CEO or Founder who acts as the initial Head of Sales. While this makes sense given the likely resource constraints, and the value to be gained in getting in front of customers from Day 1, a lack of formal sales training and an absence of a sales process can seriously undermine the initial sales efforts.
In this short post, I outline how these SaaS founders need to modify their approach and to implement a simple sales methodology to increase their odds of success.
“The CEO/founder should close at least the first 10 (or 20 or whatever) customers. That way, she knows. She knows the process, what works, what doesn’t. It’s OK if you are “terrible” at it. What matters is that somehow, someway, you still get those 10 >paying< customers closed”. Jason Lemkin
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Section 1: The Early Days
In the early days, startups are encouraged to do things that ‘do not scale’, and are advised to ‘get out of the building’ so they can engage with real prospects (regardless of the cost of customer acquisition).
“One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don’t scale.” Paul Graham
Acquisition costs incurred are likely to exceed the lifetime value (LTV) at this juncture. After all, startups are not “mini versions” of large companies as Steve Blank reminds us, but rather, are research projects designed to validate assumptions and to gain first-hand insights from the market.
“A startup is an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.” Steve Blank
Once product-market fit has been obtained, however, it is important to ensure that the costs incurred in selling are commensurate with the likely return (lifetime value) and that sales methodologies are amended to reflect the change in reality.
However, in the early days founders need to rely on their extended network initially to obtain access to prospects, and need to reflect on objections raised so these can be overcome in subsequent sales conversations.
The SaaS Sales Landscape
Firstly, it is worth understanding the sales landscape for B2B SaaS startups. When the product feature set matures, and you start versioning your application (offering different price tiers), sales will typically evolve into hybrid models where entry level solutions are low touch (ideally self-service), and enterprise offerings are more high touch.
However, at the start, your application will be anchored at a particular price point / or range.
At the bottom end, you have entry-level SaaS applications priced at circa $10/month, up to enterprise solutions at circa $10,000+/ month with many other price points along the way. Depending on where you sit on this pricing continuum, your primary approach to sales will vary greatly.
Christoph Janz of Point Nine Capital does an excellent job of describing the differences in his blog post — Five Ways to Build a $100M Business.
If your average order value is < $5,000 / year, your application ideally needs to be a ‘self-service’ model i.e. one where the user signs up themselves with ‘zero touch’ from the company.
Hence, at this level, your customer acquisition strategy needs to primarily be an organic one, based on inbound marketing i.e. creating quality content that educates the market and attracts prospects to your site. Once on your site you need to have a clear strategy on how to capture these visitors as leads. Pawel Grabowski does a great job describing the main techniques in his post : 9 Calls to Action that Convert Blog Readers into Trial Users
At this level, you need to ensure you keep your cost of customer acquisition (CAC) down so face-to-face sales meetings need to be avoided once you have achieved product-market fit.
You will also need to focus on Google Ads (target a narrow set of “exact match” commerical intent keywords initially) as well as outbound prospecting.
Activation
Once on the site, the main call to action (CTA) for visitors needs to be a ‘register’, ‘sign up’ , ‘free trial’ or ‘get started’ one, which enables the prospect to sign up easily, to onboard successfully, and to gain utility from the application straight away, without the need for much in the way of human intervention.
“The best products reward users as quickly as possible after installation and account creation. But it’s easy to forget about this and as a result, watch conversion rates from download/install-to-active fall.” Tom Tunguz
2. The Middle Ground
Price points between $5,000 and $100,000 per annum are often referred to as the ‘valley of death’, and need to be treated with caution. Many SaaS businesses occupy this zone, and a key danger here is that the cost of acquisition can easily exceed the lifetime value, and thus the business model may not be viable in the long run.
Hence, if you need face-to-face meetings to sell, have long sales cycles, and have limited upselling opportunities, you need to keep a very close eye on finances. Over time as the product matures you will want to reduce product complexity so that you reduce the human touch points, and move prospects towards the self-service end of the spectrum.
3. Enterprise Level
For those applications priced at over $100,000 a year, you are in ‘field sales’ territory, where ‘high touch sales’ are often needed, long sales cycles are the norm, and a customer success manager is needed to ensure the product is adopted and value obtained. Ideally, a hybrid model is put in place where the initial engagement is a mix of inbound marketing, and email/ phone based activity in advance of a meeting. At least at this level, margins can be high enough to ensure that any face-to-face sales efforts are justified (and given the price point remote sales are unlikely).
Finally, in the era of Covid, it is hard to imagine face-to-face meetings in the future taking place to the extent they once did so it will be important to better manage complex sales processes by derisking (purchase) decision making, reducing buyer risk and designing virtual selling (via Teams, Zoom or the like).
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Section 2 — The Art of Selling
Many early stage founders acting as sales people lack the necessary training and are undermining their ability to convert these initial prospects. However, by following a simple sales methodology they can increase their odds of a positive engagement dramatically.
A Simple Sales Methodology
The following represents a simple sales methodology that can be used as a basis to create one that works specifically for your SaaS startup.
Historically our relationship with sales training has been pretty poor. One rarely encounters entrepreneurs with sales qualifications or sees sales training listed on university curricula. Nonetheless, some basic training can ensure that you are equipped to engage with prospects in confidence. At the very least, it is worth reading up on SPIN selling and the Sandler sales system, as these are popular sales methodologies among software companies and will help you structure your approach. If you are looking for additional sales resources on selling specifically in the context of SaaS sales Winning By Design is highly recommended.
2. Create a Marketing Buyer Persona
Secondly, you should create some marketing personas to represent the characteristics of the *ideal prospect*.
“A marketing persona is a composite sketch of a key segment of your audience. For content marketing purposes, you need personas to help you deliver content that will be most relevant and useful to your audience.” Ardath Albee
When thinking about personas it is useful to think about elements like:
Once you have clarity as to some basic personas it can help ensure that your initial engagements are aligned with those you perceive as being representative buyers rather than the public at large (as shaped by your network). This will help ensure that any face to face meetings are focused on those most likely to have a need that the solution addresses. It will also help ensure that any initial marketing budget can be focused in areas where your target personas are likely to be represented.
Ideally you road test these personas initially via the likes of Linkedin — undertake a search for first level connections (friendlies) with titles and industry sectors aligning with your buyer persona. Contact these friendlies and pitch them the idea (don’t try and sell to them). At this stage you are simply looking to validate some assumptions —
After a couple of initial validation calls it is now time to go deeper with some others.
3. Meet Some Friendlies
At this early stage, you are essentially seeking to validate assumptions you’ve made about the market appetite for your solution. If your application truly meets the needs of the persona group you are already on the sales path but that should not be the key purpose of these initial meetings. Right at the start, many introductions are warm ones, as entrepreneurs rightly leverage their immediate contacts as a means to get in front of people. It is important that these friendlies represent the target persona market you have outlined, as otherwise, the feedback loop is likely to be weak, and these contacts are not likely to offer constructive criticism given they may not even relate to the pain you are seeking to address. Worse still, they may be keen not to hurt your feelings so the feedback you get contains inherent biases.
No matter how pressing the need is to bring cash in the purpose of these friendly meets is not to sell. View them as a back channel — can they validate your assumptions? What flaws do they see with your approach? How do people like them buy? Who can they introduce you to that may be interested in engaging?
4. Iterate the Application
It is important to use these initial interactions as a means to gain insights that can be
While some of these initial conversations may translate into genuine sales prospects, you will be better served in the long run if these are viewed more as collaborators.
Offering free access to some of these early contacts in return for social proof (case studies/ testimonials/ logos) is a useful way to get people using the application so future development decisions can be based on observed data rather than hypotheses.
Trying to sell to warm contacts after an outreach that sought advice is very much “bait and switch” territory and will not serve you well in the long run.
5. Put a Basic Sales Process in Place
The cost of CRM systems have collapsed and there is now a host of entry level systems you can use to manage your pipeline. Choose one, ensuring it can easily connect to any data sources you have (be that lead generation forms on websites, or existing data sets) and also ensure that it can integrate with any outbound marketing tools you may have like MailChimp. Once in place, you need to then embark on a lead generation initiative to fill the pipeline. It is also important to define a basic sales process i.e. what the various stages in your pipeline are, and how to move a prospect along the pipeline.
Applications like Zapier can be useful as it can act as glue that helps bring these disparate solutions together before you upgrade to enterprise grade solutions down the road when cashflows permit.
The sales process is likely to lean heavily on outbound, given resource constraints, as well as some content, and entry level Google Ads for high purchase intent keywords where applicable.
6. Create Content to Generate Leads
For many B2B SaaS companies, inbound marketing represents a corner stone of all marketing activity. Inbound marketing is when you create compelling content that educates and informs your target personas, and they obtain value from it. As your audience engages with the content, it builds both familiarity and trust, ensuring that your solution is ‘front of mind’ when a pain arises that your application addresses. A common approach is to gate the most valuable content behind a form where prospects provide data about themselves in return for access to the content.
One often over looked area is the importance of amplifying the content created by promoting it on a regular basis through a mix of channels from email to social media updates. The act of promoting the content needs much more emphasis than it’s mere creation.

You can read more about how to generate leads via inbound marketing in my Definitive Guide to B2B SaaS Marketing
7. Qualify the Prospect
Once you have generated leads you need to qualify them. The amount of data captured can vary from a simple email address to a detailed assessment of their needs (See FlexPort form capture below).
Again some of this pre-qualification can take place in advance of a face to face via step up forms, or email exchanges with inside sales teams. For example, I use a simple Typeform questionnaire to qualify prospects I get through my personal site. This extra layer helps to filter out those that are less committed. As the startup matures marketing automation software can be used, but in the early days some manual processes will be needed.
8. Managing the Meeting
Once the prospect has been qualified and a face to face meeting has been arranged (or increasingly a Zoom call) it is important to set the meeting agenda in advance.
Instead of defaulting to presentation mode where you ‘run through’ a PowerPoint, or better still, you take them through a high-level overview of the application, it is best to focus on a conversation where you seek to understand their needs a little better, as well as to gain an understanding as to how they buy solutions like yours. NB this is in stark contrast to how most entrepreneurs approach these meetings.
The following are the sorts of questions you should have the answers to by the end of your conversation.
1/ What is the job that they do (related to your solution) and what business pains do they have?
2/ How significant is the pain?
3/ Is the pain pressing? What if they do nothing?
4/ How do they buy solutions like yours i.e. do they need to go via procurement or can they buy direct? If they buy direct do they have to have a shortlist of vendors to chose from? Or you competing with other applications or are you competing against inertia where they stick to the status quo?
5/ Has the person you are talking to got decision-making and/or purchase authority?
6/ Have they budget?
7/ What other stakeholders are likely to be involved in the decision?
8/ What does the internal decision-making process like?
9/ What are their timelines? Do they have a compelling reason to act now? Is this something that needs to be resolved urgently?
10/ What alternatives exist in terms of solving their need? (Inertia — or doing nothing is usually the main competitor enterprise sales people have)
11) Where do they look for solutions like this (can help inform the marketing team as to where they should be concentrating their marketing budgets)
Without a checklist like this, it is all to easy to default to presentation mode when instead you need to view the interaction as an information exchange where you are looking to surface their needs so you can align your solution with these (or not if the case maybe).
Of course with all of this you need to manage your time — 30 min slots are increasingly the norm. Hence you may want to structure your process where by the above takes place seperately and in advance of a ‘sales pitch’. Only once you are clear on their requirements can you then tailor a presentation that reflects their needs.
9. Manage the Close
Once you have surfaced these answers (to the best of your ability) you are then in a better position to sell on features against these needs. You have followed the advice of Stephen Covey ‘seek first to understand and then to be understood’.
Assuming your solution addresses their needs, it is now time to showcase the power of your application before asking for the business. Only now it is time to demo!
Finally, once the demo has been done you need a script that manages the next phase. Did the feature set meet their requirements? Were there any obvious objections? Were these objections over come or were they show stoppers?
It is also important to seek an escalation of commitment from the prospective buyer to assess real intent.
Summary
In summary, selling B2B software can be challenging, particularly in the early days, when it can be difficult to generate leads as resources are tight, and sales experience is thin on the ground. By following the simple sales methodology outlined above (or a derivative of it) early stage SaaS businesses can ensure that their efforts are rewarded.

Most public SaaS companies are valued on a next-twelve-months (NTM) revenue multiple, and while revenue is also an important metric for private companies, many investors focus on ARR (annual recurring revenue). ARR is not typically reported by public SaaS companies, but it can be derived easily by multiplying quarterly subscription revenue by four. As I wrote here, for a SaaS company to get public they usually need to hit ~$100M of ARR, but how fast do they need to grow? I took a look at ~40 public or acquired high-growth SaaS companies and benchmarked their quarterly ARR from their S-1’s (companies usually report at least 8 quarters).
The chart below has the ARR ramp and net new ARR median and average added each quarter. According to this data set, SaaS companies need to be north of $100M of ARR, growing at least 60%+ YoY and adding $10M+ of net new ARR a quarter to get public.
Average and Median Quarterly ARR / Net New ARR ($M)
How about the more recent IPOs? The chart below shows the ARR ramp of the 5 enterprise software IPOs that filed this year. Note AppDynamics was acquired before they started trading.
2017 Enterprise Software IPOs Quarterly ARR ($M)
While the median ARR is ~$100M and growing 60%+ YoY, there is a wide variation among these 40 companies. Atlassian was almost at $400M of ARR and Rally Software was at $50M. Both companies had very successful offerings. I expect the next wave of SaaS IPOs to fall in the higher end of that range given companies are waiting longer to go public.
To receive these posts by email, click here.
***For back-up, here is a table with the ARR ramp (sorted by ARR) for each of the 41 companies I benchmarked — it includes the ARR at the IPO quarter and preceding reported quarters, as well as annual and quarterly growth rates.

Back in January I announced my last day at Algolia, where I had spent the last 18 months as Brand Director. During that time, the company grew from 50 to 200 people, and the marketing & design team overhauled almost every facet of the brand, content & communication strategy - I got to learn a lot. In fact, my journey with MadKudu starts at Algolia.
Joining Algolia, I knew very little about SaaS, about being an employee, and about Brand. I came in with my experience building a media brand & my intuitions that the same methodology could be applied to a SaaS brand, but everything behind the scenes was foreign to me. I was introduced to Pardot for managing marketing data, to Livestorm for running webinars. I got the hang of Lever for recruiting new team members and I got the hang of Confluence for knowledge-sharing.
Then one day, my colleague Fanette says “we’re going to start using MadKudu for lead scoring.” Our previous iteration of lead scoring, built in-house inside Pardot, hadn’t really garnered much attention — the sales team didn’t trust it and the marketing team felt the impact of that. My understanding of lead scoring was conceptual, and since qualified leads are really the best bottom of funnel metric for brand, content & communications, I subscribed to #notif-madkudu on Slack and didn’t pay much attention beyond that.
Every day, great brands were signing up for our product, Fortune 500 companies were scheduling demos, and the marketing team had no idea. Within a few weeks, the sales team caught on as well — “How do I get the MadKudu leads routed to me?” they’d ask — as it turns out, since MadKudu plugs directly into Salesforce (where sales can see how its scores leads), leads can actually be dynamically routed based on the score — but I wouldn’t discover that until later.
What was interesting was that, of all of the marketing products we used, only MadKudu had garnered sales respect. That was a feat in and of itself.
Later that year, Algolia was a sponsor for SaaStock, the premier European SaaS conference in Dublin. I went to support the Algolia team, and got to meet Guillaume Cabane in person for the first time. Some people call him “G” or “The Mad Scientist” — I wish I had come up with a nickname for my personal brand.
Guillaume’s a character deserving of his own article, but he’s also a big fan of MadKudu, and used them while he was VP Growth at Segment and uses them now while VP Growth at Drift. He talks about them everywhere he goes, which is why Francis, MadKudu’s Co-Founder & Chief Revenue Officer, as in Dublin that week.
Francis & I hung out at the tail-end of the SaaStock closing party, and I made a mental note to reach out to him next time I was in the Bay Area.
I missed MadKudu by about a minute when I was out in San Francisco last December. I had lunch with Ludovic Ulrich, who runs Salesforce’s Startup Relations as well as their Incubator in San Francisco. MadKudu had just moved out of the Salesforce tower when I met with Ludovic spoke highly of them — it had quickly becoming a trend that everyone who had interacted with them spoke highly of them.
My last trip out to San Francisco as an Algolia employee was in January — Francis & I grabbed breakfast at Hobee’s, where my Mom, my brother & I usually go for breakfast on the weekend. I learned about where MadKudu was at today, the problems they were facing, and I made a coy attempt to let Francis know that, whenever they should hire their first marketer, I’d be happy to discuss.
Francis was less coy. “We think Brand is key to success.” I hadn’t realized I was being interviewed until the eggs & hashbrowns arrived. I hardly touched them.
As Francis jumped in a car to run off to a customer meeting, he suggested I meet with Sam Levan, the co-founder & CEO, next time I’m in town. I wasn’t going to have a next time in town, so I suggested the next day. The next morning I met Sam, where I learned about where MadKudu was heading in 2018 and beyond. I also got to meet Hannah Mirza, one of the first non-founder employees whose passion for customers got me excited about customer advocacy and the potential to bring the customer voice front and center.
I learned that my experience at Algolia — MadKudu being brought in by marketing ops and slowly becoming a favorite of sales, marketing & growth — was typical, and that nearly every customer was brought in by a champion (usually after one of MadKudu’s existing customers recommended us) and then slowly became a favorite inside revenue teams.
That first week in January I really got to know the people behind MadKudu: kind, passionate, eager people who all seem to have found a common home in MadKudu. They are meticulously organized & focused — I can see already this will be a big hurdle for me — but they are also OK being authentic & honest about vulnerabilities. Short comings are shared, and plans to overcome them are set in motion. “Personal growth” is part of our daily team syncs, with each employee sharing about their latest gym efforts, hikes with dogs, handball match results or cooking session. There is an eagerness to have something good to share every day, and there is as much support in your professional accomplishments as personal.
The next trip to California was this past March, my onboarding as Head of Brand Strategy. Q1 was wrapping up and the decision had already been made to put our core engineering office in Paris. That I, a non-engineer, would be the first hire out of the Paris office wasn’t necessarily in the cards, but it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing either.
MadKudu has generated an insane amount of demand for the size they are, so I’m spending my first six months less focused on increasing signups and more focused on helping the Paris team be successful — I’m wearing a recruiter hat these days, speaking almost daily with some of Paris’ most talented Data Engineers.
At the same time, we’ve begun digging into who we are, who we’re talking to, and what kind of conversations we want to have with them. I’ll continue to write about my experiences & mistakes, and should have some more to share soon.

Download a copy of the SaaS financial spreadsheet template here
—
As I’m currently in the process of raising seed funding for my startup Marker, I had to build a financial planning model for my investors.
To speed things up, I looked for a spreadsheet template where I could simply plug numbers and be done with it. Most traditional financial models don’t work well for subscription businesses due to the recurring nature of revenues. I found some models tailored for SaaS but most were too complex for my needs (the best financial template in my opinion was from Christoph Janz).
So I built my own.
You can make a copy for yourself here.
This plan is not perfect by any means. But what it lacks in accuracy, it makes up in simplicity.
I hope this model will help early-stage SaaS entrepreneurs spend less time building financial models and more time creating and delivering value for their customers.
The rest of this post explains the logic behind the plan and how it was constructed.
Financials models are nothing more than a bunch of hypotheses thrown together in a spreadsheet. Your job is to come up with your own unique set of believable hypotheses.
That being said, all financial plan have one hypothesis in common:
Your plan will turn out to be false
At first, this got me quite frustrated.
Why the hell should I waste my time entering random numbers in a spreadsheet if I know damn well the whole plan is wrong?
Is it only an item to check on my fundraising checklist?
Not quite…
After a lot of trial and error, it hit me!
The goal of an early financial plan is not to demonstrate how great the opportunity is. The goal of an early-stage plan, especially for first-time founders, is to show investors you truly understand what drives growth.
Unless your team has a proven track record, your financial plan should serve as a tool to convince investors you know what you are talking about. Use it to show where you are going, how fast you want to go and most importantly, explain how you will get there.
Before investors will even look at the actual numbers, they are going to assume you do not have what it takes. They know the biggest risk for inexperienced early-stage founders is the execution risk.
But how do you convince investors you have what it takes?
By being practical.
As I said earlier, financial plans are nothing more than a bunch of unproven hypothesis thrown together. These hypotheses can be grouped into 2 categories.
The “costs” hypotheses are the easy ones. With a bit of research, you can easily figure how much you need to budget for each item.
The tough ones are the revenue hypotheses.
When you build a model for a SaaS business, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is the most important line on your plan. The real challenge is then to come up with reasonable, yet ambitious MRR hypotheses.
This is where it gets tricky.
Successful SaaS startups grow their MRR at a rate between 10% and 25% monthly growth rate (MoM). You can use these benchmarks as sanity checks for your model but don’t use these numbers to project your growth.
Why?
Because you’re not telling your investors how you are going to hit these growth targets. You have no clue how to grow at a 10%+ MoM growth rate.
Therefore, the key is to identify the growth hypotheses that will directly impact your MRR.
My plan has 3 growth hypotheses:
These growth leverages directly impact MRR
All others metrics (traffic growth, conversion rates, etc…) are secondary.
Now that you know what grows MRR, you can start plugging numbers and growth rates to see how the model behaves.
Open the template, look for the tabs “Growth Hypotheses” and “Cost Hypotheses” and fill out your numbers.
Then, based on your newly established goals, define what activities and actions you will put in motion to reach your goal.
Now the fun part…
Once you filled out your growth and costs hypotheses, take your 3 growth hypotheses from above and start brainstorming actions and activities you could put in motion to drive growth.
Let’s do a quick one together here:
Increase the number of new customers:
Increase the average transaction value:
Increase the frequency of repurchase
Make sure these ideas map your goals. For example, don’t bother posting 3 tweets a day if your goal is to sign 10 customers a day.
Build you own action plan and get confident you’ll be able to reach your goal.
Note: if you’re not sure how to get all these metrics, use a SaaS dashboard tool like profitwell.com
Financial planning is more than an item you check on your fundraising checklist.
It’s a tool to help bridge the gap between you and your investors.
Startup investing is all about reducing risk (both factual and perceived) as much as possible. Use your financial plan as a tool to help your investors understand your reasoning. By doing so, you decrease their perception of risk and increase your odds of getting funded.
And remember, the goal is not to make the plan perfect. The goal is to get investors confident that you know what you are talking about.
Good luck!

During the first half of the last century, numerous fortunes were made electrifying devices that were previously manual. Because electrification was new, the qualifying term “electric” was an important distinction when describing these newfangled gadgets. However, the adjective “electric” was eventually dropped when all the devices in a product category utilized the technology. Software terminology is stubbornly not following a similar evolution.
It’s high time we kill the term Software As A Service (SaaS) and call it what it is — software. Even Salesforce abandoned it’s silly “No Software” tagline, after the company had to explain in 2015 that it meant, “No legacy software, just cloud software.”
You’re not a SaaS company, you’re a software company. You’re not a SaaS investor, you’re a software investor. You’re not a SaaS entrepreneur, you’re a software entrepreneur.
ASP To SaaS To Software
In the early 2000’s, my software startup was dubbed an Application Service Provider (ASP). At that time, I had to explain to skeptical customers that it made more sense for them to rent our software on a subscription basis, rather than purchase it outright. With few exceptions, no one now buys premise-based software. However, moving companies to the cloud was an exhausting process.
I vividly recall a meeting at Siebel to explore a potential partnership by which Siebel would sell our GoToAssist screen sharing technology to its customers. Each of the Siebel executives wore suites and ties, which seemed out of place, even fifteen years ago.
Even more off putting than their wardrobe was their arrogance. After patiently explaining that we were unwilling to deviate from our cloud-based business model, a senior member of the Siebel team derisively told me (I’m obviously paraphrasing from memory here), “Our customers will never allow software to be delivered through their firewalls! If the software does not reside on our customers’ servers, we won’t sell it.”
By the time we launched GoToMeeting, the term ASP had largely been replaced with Software as a Service (SaaS) and the software subscription model was firmly established. Despite the prescience of the Siebel executives, we successfully sold GoToMeeting, and the other GoTo family of products, to Citrix in 2004 for a tidy sum.
Vertical Software To Mobile First
Over the next decade, thousands of startups focused on software verticals in which they displaced Siebel-like, premise software with solutions delivered via the cloud.
Although software startups continue to be founded to exploit vertical markets, few of them now compete with legacy, “boxed” software. Rather, the software companies I’ve invested in, such as JazzHR, TaxJar and SimpleLegal, compete with Web 1.0 desktop oriented dinosaurs which utilize the cloud, but offer a poor user experience, especially on mobile devices.
Even so, we don’t call this new crop of companies “Better GUI Software” or even “Mobile First Software” startups. Instead, we continue to use the anachronistic term SaaS, even though no company on the planet still delivers old-school software on a disk.
Vertical Artificial Intelligence
An expansive and lucrative greenfield opportunity, especially for startups, is the vertical applications of artificial intelligence. Tim Urban’s Wait But Why blog does a great job of describing today’s AI capabilities. According to Tim, we are currently leveraging, “Artificial Narrow Intelligence (which) is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds human intelligence or efficiency at a specific thing.” Some of the examples he cites include self-driving cars, complex mobile apps such as Siri, Pandora and Waze, as well as Spam filters.
Tim goes on to conclude that eventually AI will morph from verticalized, narrow intelligence, to “Artificial General Intelligence (which) refers to a computer that is as smart as a human across the board — a machine that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can.”
Though AI technology is evolving rapidly, generalized artificial intelligence is still years away, leaving plenty of time for entrepreneurs to create tremendous value creating vertical AI solutions, in the same way software engineers in the 1980’s first computerized manual workflows with the advent of the PC.
Just as it eventually became unnecessary to qualify hairdryers as “electric,” a similar nomenclature evolution will no doubt occur in the auto industry. Soon it will be an anachronism to describe cars as “electric,” as the distinction with petroleum-based cars will be irrelevant. Hopefully, by then, we’ll also have finally stopped identifying software as SaaS.

Hi there lone Marketing Manager,
If you are anything like me in my first year as a marketing team of one at a rapidly growing startup, you might have already searched this very title in Google.
Though I’m no longer a lone ranger on my team, that time where I was taught me a few tricks of the trade (or “hacks” as I like to call them) that helped me do the work of a fully-scaled marketing team.
To help you along in your hustle, I’ve decided to share my top five hacks. Without further ado, here they are:
It can be really tough when you don’t feel like you have enough time in your day to complete everything you need to complete. And the truth is, even if you follow my first hack, you might still feel like that.
The value of time blocking your day is to focus on the most crucial tasks at hand and make sure you have time scheduled on your calendar to complete them. Treat it like you would any other meeting to ensure that time doesn’t get filled with something less important.
2. Obsess Over Organization
One of the most challenging things for me is when I feel like have tasks floating around everywhere. There might be some in my email, my notebook, my calendar, a paper napkin from lunch, etc.
One thing I did very early on in my role was to adopt the project management tool called Trello. This Kanban-style tool makes it super easy to manage and prioritize all of the tasks I need complete. I literally put every single thing I needed to do in there regardless of how big or small it was. My new favorite hack on Trello is a Chrome extension called Ultimello which helps me sort my lists by due date.
3. Streamline Social Media
Somewhere between the time Myspace and Snapchat debuted, marketers began to think they had to have a brand presence on every single social network. And if you can maintain that as a marketing team of one, you are my hero!
If not, then you have to pick a few channels that make the most sense to your brand. For us, it was Twitter and LinkedIn. For you, it might be Facebook, Instagram or any of the other emerging platforms that make the most sense for your industry.
Once you decide which platforms to invest your time in, pick a tool that helps automate this process. Buffer is a great tool and it’s free. They also have a great Chrome Extension to help you easily curate posts right from your browser.
4. Set Some Goals
You won’t know you are successful unless you set some goals to measure yourself against. Don’t worry if you do not have much data to compare against. The main idea is to have something to work towards and also something to reflect on down the line. Having goals in place will also help you to drive the business forward.
5. Get By With A Little Help From Your Friends
This one comes in two parts. One part is to get to know some great contractors. Though you can’t do everything yourself, you can utilize some great resources who can help you maximize your time and efforts. There are sites like Fiverr where people can do design work for as little as $5 per hour.
The second part involves real friends. I started a monthly marketing manager lunch because I began to meet others who were in the same boat as me. This was very helpful in exchanging ideas and working my way through challenges.
Being a marketing manager on a team of one is definitely challenging, but hopefully these tips can help you make the best of it and see success!
Cheers!

先日の CVC 向けメトリクス勉強会でも紹介した「The Startup Founder’s Guide to Analytics (スタートアップ創業者のための分析ガイド)」というとても良い記事があります。誰かが訳すかなと思っていたのですが、なかなか訳されないようなので簡単に紹介しておきます。詳しくは元の記事を御覧ください。
現在 Fishtown Analytics の CEO の Tristan は、Squarespace や RJMetrics、Argyle Social などでの分析系の実務経験を経て、現在はシリーズA以降のスタートアップ向けに分析ツールコンサルを行っています。彼はスタートアップの従業員数を軸に以下のフェーズに分け、それぞれのフェーズで必要な分析ツール（あるいは不必要な分析ツール）を紹介しています。
この記事を元に、自分たちの会社規模に即した分析ツール群がきちんと導入されているか（あるいはあまりに多く導入されすぎてないか）を考えつつ、あくまでこの記事は理想なので、それを踏まえた上でうまく自分たちに活かせそうなところを見つける指針になれば良いのかなと思います。
Google Analytics と Google Tag Manager は基本として入れておき、イベントトラッキングとして Mixpanel か Heap の導入が勧められています。このあたりは本当に簡単に導入できるので、ノンテクの創業者でもやっておくと良いかと…。
会計ツールとして Quickbooks、サブスクリプションビジネスなら Baremetrics がお勧めされています。日本では少し違うかもしれませんね。
あとは不必要なことはやるな、というのがこのフェーズです。
マーケやセールス担当の人が入ってくるフェーズなので、UTM トラッキングや CRM の導入を始めつつ、NPS を計測するために Wootric か Delighted を導入する、というのが指針です。
グーロスしていくための基盤づくりのために、data warehouse、ETL、BI ツールの導入を開始するフェーズで、この部分が一番難しくクリティカルだそうです。
データウェアハウスでは Snowflake か Redshift。ETL は Stitch と Fivetran、BI ツールとしては Mode や Looker などを検討するのがお勧めとのこと。記事にかかれている通り、分析担当者やコンサルタントを雇うことを検討しても良いと思います。
OSS を活用しながら自社ならではのグロースを追い求めていくフェーズです。データサイエンティストの雇用を考える時期であるとも書かれています。
SQLベースのデータモデリングプロセスの確立は Fishtown Analytics が公開している dbt などで。3rd party 製のツールだと間に合わない＆課金が重くなってくる頃なので、Web 分析やイベントトラッキングは Mixpanel 等から Snoplow Analytics に移行。とはいえ、あまりに重い投資をするのも無駄になるので、Spark や Hadoop の環境を揃えていくのではなく Jupyter Notebooks などの活用も検討をしてもいいかも、ということでした。
分析専門の人が 3–6 人以上フルタイムでいるような状況です。Airbnb の知識のスケーリングの記事や Creating a Data-Driven Organization などに参照が張られています。
コンサルタント目線からのレコメンドですが、スタートアップのフェーズを確認しつつ分析基盤を整えていく上で一つの基準点になる良い記事ではないかと思います。「何をやるべきでないか」もきちんと書かれている元記事も是非ご参照ください。

Note: My experience in customer development has been largely with SaaS (B2B) startups. Therefore, many of my lessons may not be directly applicable in a B2C scenario.
I conducted a workshop a few months ago, on customer development as part of the ProductNation initiative. Much of the content in this post is derived from the notes I had prepared for that workshop.
I’ve divided this post into the following 3 sections:
In the 2 years I spent in the product and growth team at BrowserStack, I spoke with hundreds of customers on the phone. The primary objective of this customer development exercise at BrowserStack was to improve the product and build new features to drive growth for the company.
Customer development is certainly not asking your customers what they want and then building it.
What customer development really does is help identify the right problems to solve so that you build something that your customers will buy. Additionally, it helps you validate your hypothesis and assumptions. The idea is to spend more time speaking with your customers and less time and money on engineering and design.
I cannot overemphasize the importance of identifying the right problems to solve. BrowserStack gets this right. I was told by the CEO there that solutions are relatively easy but identifying the right problem to solve is not. I couldn’t agree more.
In sum, customer development doesn’t provide you with all the answers on what to build. But it definitely provides a better understanding of customers and a keener appreciation of the problems they grapple with. You will still need a founder or a product manager to sift through all the information to determine what is relevant, prioritize the inputs received and decide how to turn the inputs into a tangible feature or a product.
A good point to start the the process of customer development is with some hypotheses you’re trying to validate. If you’re building a new product from scratch, there will be some hypotheses you have about the industry or the problems you think your potential customers face. Your logical next step then would be to get on a call with your potential customers and find out as much as you can about their problems before you even start building anything. This step is applicable to even a small feature you’re trying to build for an already existing product.
For example, in BrowserStack, one of the hypotheses we had was that occasional usage of the product was one of the biggest contributing factors to a high churn rate. Therefore, our customer development exercise in this case was focused on understanding the behavior and day-to-day activities of our customers and the availability of alternatives as a result of which they were canceling their subscriptions.
In order to validate your hypothesis, you need to speak with your customers or your potential customers if you don’t already have a product. Therefore, let’s first identify who your ideal customers are or who your ideal customers could be. You should be able to define your ideal customers through a mix of the following parameters: Industry, Size of company (based on the number of employees or revenue), Region, Role/Function, Title. Let’s call the different sets of ideal customers created through the parameters above as user personas. For example, in BrowserStack, one of the personas was QA Managers in Enterprises (1000+ employees) in the Technology (Software) industry.
Once you’ve identified your user personas, you need to create an actual list of users you could speak with. If you already have a product that is being used by customers, then creating the list is not a problem. However, do note that the user personas of your free and paid product could be different and you will need to speak with the relevant ones based on the problem you’re trying to solve. If you’re building a new product, in addition to reaching out to your personal network, you could also scour LinkedIn for potential contacts and get in touch with them over LinkedIn itself or through Twitter. Quora could also be a place where you could identify people you could speak with.
Once you start this exercise, you will realize that people are actually not that averse to speaking with you. They do it for different reasons. At BrowserStack, people loved the product and they loved propagating the product in their organization. Who wouldn’t want to be known as the person who introduced and evangelized an amazing product in their company? We had many such users at BrowserStack. Scheduling calls with them was a breeze. Some others are just willing to help. And many others feel important when you tell them that this exercise is limited to a certain number of people and that their inputs would help shape the future of a product or a business.
Once you’ve created this list of users, reach out to them through email to schedule a call or an in-person meeting. Among the customers you reach out to, the response rates for the ones willing to get on the phone with you depend on how you sell to your customers. For self-service sales (as was the case with BrowserStack), around 20% of the free users (those without a subscription) I reached out to were willing to get on the phone with me. For paid users, the response rate was as high as 50% to 70%. For inside-sales or field sales (as is the case at WebEngage, the startup I work with currently), almost all the customers want to speak with me.
Following is an example of an email I had sent to some of our registered users on BrowserStack who had not purchased a subscription. Once they responded with an answer, I was successful in requesting them to get on the phone with me to answer some of the other questions I had based on their first reply.
I have a slight preference for conducting customer development studies over the phone than through in-person meetings. I can take notes during the call without distracting the customer whereas taking notes in an in-person meeting can be a distraction for the other person. I have done some customer development studies on Email as well but these have been mostly for very specific questions I had. I personally don’t prefer online surveys. I think these should only be done when you already have some options/solutions in mind and you’re only seeking help from your customers to validate and prioritize.
If you’re doing customer development over the phone, take into consideration the timezone your users reside in and suggest time-slots to them based on their time zones. Use LinkedIn or Rapportive to figure out where your customers are located. Also, ask them for their mobile numbers specifically. I’ve had people not join the scheduled conference calls in the past as they forgot about it or missed the calendar reminder. And I tend to now ask them directly for their mobile numbers as the odds of the call happening are much better in this case.
Lastly, for the emails you send out to schedule these calls, remember to follow up with a 2nd email to those who did not respond to your 1st email. I cannot overemphasize the power of the follow up. Half my calls at BrowserStack got scheduled through the follow up! Needless to say the emails have to be personalized. Nobody likes signing up for some generic customer study.
Here’s an example of a follow-up email I had sent to the customers at BrowserStack:
In this section, I’ll cover some of the questions I always ask customers. This is not an exhaustive list and your exact list of questions will differ based on the hypothesis you’re trying to validate. I generally tend to prepare around 15 to 20 questions that I need answers to during the call. Of course, the order in which I ask my questions is dynamic and depends completely on how the call is going.
In my experience, open-ended questions work much better than close-ended ones. I tend to not ask the user to choose among options or what they think about a particular solution. I’ve realized that I only end up biasing the user or constraining their thinking with such close-ended questions. An example of a close-ended question is Do you prefer A or B? Instead of asking the user to choose between two options, I tend to ask more questions about the problem the user is facing.
Following are some basic questions I usually include in my customer development calls:
Take copious notes during your call. Record your calls so that you can refer to them later. As soon as your call is done, create a summary of what was discussed during the call. When you start doing multiple such calls in a day, it becomes difficult to remember who said what.
Once all your calls are done, create a summary of all the call logs in one place. Look for patterns in the summary and try converting these patterns into solid findings. Based on these findings you will be able to determine the plan of action for your product.
Of course, this entire customer development process is iterative in nature. You will take these inputs, build a product or feature or create a strategy and put that into practice, do more of the customer development to validate what you’ve built and so on.
Lastly, while the process of customer development is continuous in nature where you’re speaking with your customers on almost a daily/weekly/fortnightly basis, the majority of customer development tends to happen in the initial stages when you’re trying to validate your hypothesis.
You will start seeing some patterns as soon you have made between 10 and 15 calls. Later user interactions tend to yield similar patterns. Hence, you may decide to conclude customer development studies for the your hypothesis when you stop hearing new things.
Each call can take anywhere between 30 and 45 minutes. I would not suggest doing more than 4 customer development calls or meetings in a day as the process can be exhausting. Remember, in addition to just speaking with your customers, you’re also taking notes and summarizing the discussion as soon as you’re done with the call.
If your product has been in the market for a few years, you could also consider putting together a Customer Advisory Board that you can depend on for testing your initial hypothesis and for validating your solution. While I was at BrowserStack, our competitor SauceLabs had put together this board. This made their customers feel important. So much so that some of them had updated their LinkedIn profile to mention that they were a part of this board.
At BrowserStack, we employed customer development to build features addressing a number of problems eg. increasing conversion, reducing churn, revamping pricing etc. In the future, I will cover some of the specifics of how we went about solving these problems and the role that customer development played in tackling these problems.

Top highlight
Startups are built to solve specific problems. When starting out, we focus all our energies on solving that specific problem. Any effort spent on anything else is wasted.
Choosing your software tools is no different. Today’s tools are amazing, and it’s not worth over optimizing when starting out. The important thing is to quickly choose tools that won’t slow you down, and keep building.
Over the course of starting 3 companies over the last decade and advising dozens more, I’ve gotten a pretty good sense of the right tools for the job.
The first question anyone needs to start with when picking the right set of tools is what you want to optimize around. There are inherent tradeoffs when choosing products, such as cost vs functionality, security vs speed, ease of use vs powerful integrations.
Here are the important attributes for early companies to optimize around:
The following recommendations optimize around these six attributes.
Here’s a handful of critical apps you’ll need to get any organization up and running quickly and cost effectively.
Team Collaboration Sub-Stack
You can’t go wrong with these tools. This stack will cover your core operational needs, quickly, cheaply, with a ton of flexibility going forward.
If you’re building a software product, you’ll need a set of additional tools to help build, measure, iterate and support your product. These additional tools are still evaluated on the initial set of six attributes, with an expanded set of functionality.
Product + Engineering
Support
Key Ops Tools
SOC 2 audits are becoming increasingly common for SaaS companies. If you’re planning on doing one, or simply want to get ahead of the game, you can adopt a few additional tools that will make your life easier down the road. Setting them up early will save time and likely make it easier to iterate on your processes while you’re smaller.
If you want to instantly track which SaaS tools you’re already using, optimize spending, improve security, see how you stack up against others, and get customized insights, sign up for early access to Blissfully.

Working on cold outreach after scouting for a bunch of prospects through a witty hack doesn’t have the same impact as it did a few years ago. With SaaS, we like to convince ourselves the products are so great, so fast to deploy, so easy to use that the product sells itself. Taking the popularity of freemium-to-premium models for SaaS, it’s clear where that tale comes from. But as many figure out to their shock, when they try to expand to more departments in a government agency or large company, after landing users, this is extremely untrue. SaaS products don’t sell themselves, even with early viral growth.
And you might have landed a fancy client, but that doesn’t mean you can keep that sliver of business, let alone cross-sell, upsell, or sell across more divisions which could span many geographies. Doing so would require creating an outside sales team on top of the inside team. It’s exactly when the product feels like it is selling itself that building out this process and sales team is critical. Stalling or stopping at this point might expose you to competition and lose you the race to be number one in your category. Below are a few more points to keep in mind when it comes to selling SaaS products.
Staffing your company with professional services, customer-facing resources, customer support, etc. at this stage is an investment that will give good returns not just in increasing your footprint within that account but in building the mightiest sales tool there is: a good reference. Of course, new clients are great, but the best place to sell anything is where you’ve already sold it. So it’s critical that you turn that early customer into an internal advocate and an unassailable external reference. You see, great products and services don’t have to sell themselves. Their champions help sell it for them.

By Sairam Krishnan & Avinash Raghava
The current state of India’s services and software industry is on thin ice. Business has slowed as the nature of their clients, and the way they do business, has been changing at a rapid pace. This means there will be an impact on the fortunes of and jobs in the IT services industry — and, indeed, the broader economy. We are already seeing this play out around us.
But there may be a sliver of light among these clouds, one that has the potential to become especially bright. Before we get to that, though, let’s do a quick macro-level rewind of the Indian economy. One reason to do this is that we want to talk a little bit about jobs.
In the decades before the liberalisation of the early 1990s, low economic growth haunted a closed country with poor exports and incredible red-tape. It was a different, difficult time, and the centrally planned economy limped along like a steam-powered train going up a hill station. Except the scenery wasn’t beautiful.
Post-liberalisation, India’s middle class rose, both as producers and consumers, and the country’s growth lifted millions out of poverty and into the much-vaunted middle class. But in the absence of large investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, and the relatively slow growth in exports, there was still a dearth of well-paying, cognitively-demanding, and future-oriented jobs.
This is when the software services wave helped India and its young. What started as a business run over point-to-point leased data circuits bloomed into its own by the turn of the century thanks to the Y2K scare. If the first four decades of Independent India had its people dependent on its government and the public sector for secure jobs, the 1990s, 2000s and much of the last decade told a story of IT services supplying India with secure, well-paying jobs, changing the trajectory of entire families and the whole economy in a single generation.
Today, as the Indian IT services industry stares at a reboot as its business gets disrupted by the march of automation, there’s a sunrise sector — the sliver of light we referred to earlier — coming into being: the SaaS wave, which is being termed a trillion dollar opportunity.
India-rooted SaaS businesses are in a prime position to be able to address changing software needs for SMB and mid-market companies in the US. Helping the SaaS sector extend and grow its footprint will unlock a treasure-chest for India’s future.
Let’s break that down, with a little bit of background.
Most of yesteryear’s software was of a variety called on-premise. Basically, companies had to buy and run the software they wanted to use on their computers and servers, and this meant that only large companies with the finances and other resources, were able to deploy computing and data for their business processes.
But in the late 90s, cloud computing rose to try to give smaller companies, and even larger ones that demanded more flexibility with their software, other options. Salesforce was the first major heavyweight to own this advantage over on-premise. Labelling themselves as ‘No Software’, they gave SMBs and mid-market clients the opportunity to deploy computing power, without going through the hassle of building their own servers, or having to pay massive deployment costs.
Soon, SaaS became the software of choice for more and more companies in the US and across the world.
In India, the rise of SaaS also meant something different, something more: If software didn’t have to be installed in person and could be deployed and managed over the internet, we could do it from here.
In India, Zoho was among the first wave of companies that used the cost arbitrage of India’s software talent, and the cloud advantage to build a massive business. Following Zoho (and literally from its ranks) came Freshworks and Chargebee, poster boys for another generation. But these weren’t the only ones. The list includes Wingify, Unmetric (acquired by Falcon), CloudCherry (acquired by Cisco), Attune, Indix (acquired by Avalara), PipeCandy, Klenty, MadStreetDen, Go Frugal, BrowserStack, iCertis, Druva, WebEngage, Clevertap, Zenoti, HighRadius, Rategain, and a whole host of others.
With these companies leading the way, there is now a surge of young SaaS players who are on the way to making India a SaaS powerhouse. The services wave of the 1990s and 2000s made sure that India continually invested in technology education, and that entrepreneurs and professionals already know the global services playbook. And with the rise of Indian SaaS, these very skills and experience will be put to use.
This week, India’s SaaS ecosystem converges in Chennai for SaaSBooMi, a ‘for founders — by founders’ event focused on helping the second round of SaaS companies from this part of the world. This is the second edition of SaaSBooMi, in which more than 400 companies are due to participate and learn from the founders of the biggest and most successful SaaS companies. The future looks incredibly bright for Indian SaaS companies and when the history of this industry is written, SaaSBooMi will be a key milestone for the next decade’s superstar job and value creators.
Gartner predicts that the public cloud services market will grow to $266.4 billion, up from $227.8 billion in 2019. Of this, SaaS will be the biggest contributor — forecast to grow to $116 billion in 2020. Though India has a very small share of that today, a recent NASSCOM report, quoted here in the Economic Times, said that the Indian SaaS market is estimated to hit $3.3–3.4 billion by 2022. This is line with a 2016 prediction from a joint report by Google and VC firm Accel, that India is likely to become a $10 billion revenue industry with an 8% share of the global SaaS by 2025.
Community-driven events like SaaSBooMi are brilliant ways to grow this wave in scale and scope. But we can do more. Structural interventions from the government, including efforts to reduce bureaucratic friction around legal issues and taxation can help stimulate a sector that is showing willingness to put in the hard yards.
India-rooted SaaS is primed to be the biggest mover of the Indian economy of the 2020s. It’s up to all of us to make this happen.

Thanks also to the data inputs from NASSCOM, SaaSBOOMi and Zinnov.

I’ve done a keynote talk today at the B2BRocks conference at Station F in Paris. It was a slightly special moment because this conference is actually the first SaaS conference I have ever been to—about 6 years ago when I was a student at HEC and Alex. Delivet introduced me to the startup ecosystem. I don’t think I even knew what SaaS was at the time ;)
The initial presentation about the topic —which I have published here— was made for a 2-hour workshop so I have had to rebuild the slides a little to make it fit within the 15 minutes I had today.
Nothing super new but the slides are a little nicer and the presentation is shorter. Hope it can be of help to some early-stage SaaS entrepreneurs starting to build a KPI dashboard or just looking for benchmarks!

Sammy is the Managing Director and Cofounder of Blossom Street Ventures. Connect on LinkedIn or email him directly at sammy@blossomstreetventures.com, especially founders at all stages.
On median and average, fast growing SaaS businesses are unprofitable. So what is the “healthy” level of burn to drive growth? We looked at the last 36 software IPOs to answer the question (going back to MongoDB in 2017). The data is below and observations follow.
Revenue to burn is 3.5 : 1. That’s the acceptable level of SaaS burn. We arrive at that figure by looking at the median and average operating income which is -26% and -31% respectively. That’s 3.8x revenue to operating income and 3.2x, respectively. Since all of these companies are very successful (they IPO’d after all), it’s safe to say that so long as SaaS revenue is growing nicely and you’re retaining the customer, you’re allowed to lose money; just make sure to generate 3.5x as much revenue for every dollar of loss.
Few are profitable. Only 8 of the 36 companies (22%) are profitable with Zoominfo and Certara showing the best margins at 32% and 28% respectively.
A few are very unprofitable. Qualtrics which just went public has an anemic margin of -168%. Coming in second place is the highly valued and hyped Snowflake at -135%.

Today, everyone are moving towards Cloud World (AWS/GCP/Azure/PCF/VMC). It might be a public cloud, a private cloud or a hybrid cloud.
But are you aware of what are Services Cloud Computing provides to us ????
Majorly there are three categories of Cloud Computing Services:
a) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) : It provides only a base infrastructure (Virtual machine, Software Define Network, Storage attached). End user have to configure and manage platform and environment, deploy applications on it.
AWS (EC2), GCP (CE), Microsoft Azure (VM) are examples of Iaas.
b) Software as a Service (SaaS) : It is sometimes called to as “on-demand software”. Typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. In SaaS everything can be managed by vendors: applications, runtime, data, middleware, OSes, virtualization, servers, storage and networking, End users have to use it.
GMAIL is Best example of SaaS. Google team managing everything just we have to use the application through any of client or in browsers. Other examples SAP, Salesforce .
c) Platform as a Service (PaaS): It provides a platform allowing end user to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
Google App Engine, CloudFoundry, Heroku, AWS (Beanstalk) are some examples of PaaS.
Below fig 1.0 while give you more idea on it.
d) Container as a Service (CaaS): Is a form of container-based virtualization in which container engines, orchestration and the underlying compute resources are delivered to users as a service from a cloud provider.
Google Container Engine(GKE), AWS (ECS), Azure (ACS) and Pivotal (PKS) are some examples of CaaS.
e) Function as a Service (FaaS): It provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
AWS (Lamda), Google Cloud Function are some examples of Faas
Hope this gives you clear idea on what are Cloud Computing Services provided in market!!!!!!

Top highlight
For the fifth year in a row, we’re proud to work with Pacific Crest Securities, a SaaS-focused investment banking firm, to share results from a survey of 336 SaaS companies. The survey represents deep benchmarking data and insights on growth and operation of SaaS companies.
Many thanks to the readers of forEntrepreneurs who participated in the survey and to the team at Pacific Crest Securities for their work on the survey. To learn more about Pacific Crest Securities or download the full report, click here.
Part 1 of the survey results focuses on growth rates, go-to-market trends and cost structure. A new highlight in this year’s survey is data on balancing growth and profitability in SaaS companies, commonly known as The Rule of 40%.
You can find Part 2 of the results here, which compares application delivery methods, operational costs and gross margins, contract terms, churn rates, capital requirements and accounting methods.
We’ve also published the forEntrepreneurs 2016 SaaS Survey Infographic! The infographic pulls together major takeaways from the SaaS Survey and ties in advice for founders on relevant metrics.
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
As expected, many of the fastest growing companies are among the smallest. Eliminating them brings median growth rates down ~10% points. Median growth rates are consistent with last year’s results. However, this year’s respondent pool was more evenly distributed.
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
Not surprisingly, companies that spend more on sales and marketing (as a % of revenue) generally grew at a faster rate than those that spent less. This year’s results were in-line with previous surveys.
While field sales remains the most popular way to sell for companies >$2.5MM revenue, companies with <$2.5MM revenue tended to use inside sales as their primary mode of distribution. In comparison with previous surveys, companies $2.5MM+ have shifted to greater use of field sales (+12 percentage points from 2015).
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
The median CAC ratio per $1 of upsells is $0.27, or 24% of the CAC to acquire each new customer dollar. The CAC ratio number for expansions is $0.20, or 18% of the CAC to acquire each new customer dollar. For renewals, it is $0.13, or 12%. These results are substantially similar to previous years. If you want to read more on CAC, you may find this post to be of interest — Startup Killer: The Cost of Customer Acquisition.
We used answers on CAC ratio and subscription gross margin questions to determine an implied CAC payback period.
Respondents reported an implied median CAC payback period of ~18 months, though there was a wide distribution of responses.
“What is your gross profit margin on just subscription/SaaS revenues?”
Median subscription gross margins are 78% (nearly identical when removing the smallest companies from the group). These results are virtually unchanged from 2015, 2014, and 2013 results.
Survey results did not point to a significant difference in direct commissions between companies that predominantly use a field go-to-market strategy vs. inside sales. However, the median fully-loaded commission for field sales (12%) was higher than that for inside (10%).
Commissions on renewals are either non-existent or very low, with 40% paying no commission and a median rate of 3% among those paying one. Upsells command a median rate of 7% and more than half of companies pay full commissions on upsells. The most significant changes compared to last year include: 1) Upsells: 59% paid full commission rates on upsells vs. 45% in last year’s group; comparable to 58% in 2013 results. 2) This year, only 11% paid full commission on TCV for multiple year contracts vs. 20% in last year’s group.
(Excluding Companies <$2.5MM in Revenue)
Results are largely in-line with previous results, but EBITDA and FCF margin were much more negative than respondents predicted (1% EBITDA margin and 3% FCF margin for 2015).
(Including Companies $15MM+ in Revenue)
In this year’s survey, we sought to evaluate how SaaS companies of scale (at least $15MM of 2015 GAAP revenue) trade off growth and profitability (as measured by EBITDA margin). This has become a hot topic for management and investors as attitudes have shifted away from “growth at any cost”. The median growth plus profit margin in the group was 20%.
(Including Companies $15MM+ in Revenue)
~26% of respondents with at least $15MM in 2015 GAAP revenue had a revenue growth rate + EBITDA margin of 40% or higher — “The Rule of 40%”, a popular benchmark for top SaaS company performance.
The median TTM revenue growth rate + adj. EBITDA margin for publicly traded SaaS companies was ~37%, implying that just under one half met or exceed “The Rule of 40%”.

In the past couple of years, a growing number of B2B software companies have launched their marketplace / app store where users can find apps and plugins built by third-party developers. The godfather of these SaaS marketplaces is, obviously, Salesforce’s AppExchange which was launched back in 2005 (!). Since then many have followed. Of the twenty biggest public SaaS companies (by market cap), fourteen now offer an app store. And this trend is not limited to public companies: private companies such as Slack, Stripe or more recently Intercom also provide one to their users.
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
It seems that every SaaS company grows big enough until it develops its app marketplace.
This rise of app stores is driven, in my opinion, by two trends.
Industry maturity: more and more established champions. We are in a phase where SaaS is not the “hot new thing” anymore. The SaaS landscape, in many software categories like Sales, Marketing, or HR, seems to have reached maturity and doesn’t evolve as fast as it used to. Big SaaS companies dominate many verticals (Salesforce, Zendesk, Workday, Hubspot) and have reached such a size and control such a market share that it will be hard for newcomers to disrupt them.
Now that they have established dominance, they need to solidify it and create new moats. A good way to do that is by launching a software marketplace. It enables them to provide value to their customers without developing too many products in-house, and it also creates network effect dynamics: a critical mass of users and third-party developers can lock the market even more.
Users’ consumption habits: a convenient model when dealing with too many apps. In 2018 there is no shortage of SaaS to choose from. Faced with this explosion of tools, customers privilege convenience. The app store model is relevant in that case as it is one that most people are used to (think of how you consume apps on your mobile). Many SaaS users have now settled with a bunch of main software (Google suite, Slack, Salesforce…) that they use as hubs to consume other apps.
Product: building integrations to the major app stores becomes a must. A benchmark conducted by Profitwell showed that products with +4 integrations have 25–30% higher retention than products with no integration at all. In another survey conducted by BetterCloud, the respondents (IT professionals) placed “integrations” at the fourth position of the criteria they care about when purchasing a SaaS (behind cost, security, and Ease of use). It is crucial for SaaS founders to consider developing integrations with the major SaaS platforms early on.
Marketing & Sales: app stores are viable distribution/acquisition channels. In the current environment, several SaaS app stores have become significant distribution channels. To a point that many startups generate the majority of their revenue through these platforms (especially on AppExchange). This trend will definitely grow and cannot be ignored by SaaS founders.
Product strategy. The increasing importance of SaaS apps stores directly impacts the product roadmap:
Go to market strategy. In a crowded SaaS landscape, building an integration / plugin can be a great way to:
HR / recruiting strategy. The different aspects mentioned above imply that new skills are required to build and market on these platforms. This is why there is an increasing demand for “Partnerships and API” roles on the:

The inaugural SaaStock 2016 took place in Dublin, Ireland on September 21–22, 2016. It brought together over 60 speakers, and 700 delegates from 30+ countries, who all shared a common passion for B2B/ Software as a Service (SaaS).
The following represent some of the key lessons from the event:
The event opened with the ever insightful Des Traynor of Intercom taking us on a journey through the evolution of software from the 1840’s beginning with Ada Lovelace. He described how the evolution of SaaS has led to a ‘product centric’ world.
Old world — sell to CEO and hope the product trickles down
New world — sell to me and I evangelize internally
Old world — buy before you try
New world — try before you buy
The theme of Des’ keynote was on the importance of being a ‘product first’ company which was one a number of other speakers such as Peter Coppinger from Teamwork also focused on.
Des went on to argue that additional features for your SaaS application always needed to be feasible, viable and desirable.
Recurring usage = recurring value = recurring revenue
Occasional usage = occasional value = occasional revenue
He also cautioned against getting sucked into what he describes as low impact, low value work arguing that product first companies focus exclusively on high impact work.
In essence, Des was arguing that putting more resources on product, over and above sales and marketing was much more important in the early day’s of a SaaS startups evolution. Of course, this can be a challenge (particularly for VC backed companies) where pressures on driving growth often shift the focus to investing in sales to the detriment of product.
“Product first companies need to worry about churn more than growth.”
2. Make Sure You Have Achieved Product Market Fit
Peter Reinhardt the CEO, Co-Founder of Segment spoke about finding product/ market fit, which again was a topic that came up numerous times through out the day.
“80% of SaaS companies never make product market fit.”
Many speakers argued that European companies often dialed up their sales and marketing spend before finding product / market fit and they warned delegates against ramping up too quickly.
“Don’t blow your seed round on paid adverts. Invest in engineering and build a world class product.” Nick Franklin and Christoph Janz
How do you know when you’ve found product/ market fit?
“Product Market fit feels like a landmine going off.”
Peter argued that far too many SaaS startups did not find product / market fit and interpreted weaker signals as representing it.
“Glimmers of false hope is not the same as customers wanting to rip it out of your hands.”
3. Plan a Successful Entry into The US Market
The topic of the US was also a common theme throughout the day given the attractiveness of the market (not withstanding the challenges associated with entering a market with domestic competitors).
“Europe is a great place to start — the question is how do you address the US market?”
The need to have a solution that was attractive to the US was important, and a range of suggestions included; the importance of European companies operating on an ‘English first’ basis, and recruiting staff from beyond their own countries to ensure cultural diversity from day one.
“If you want to build a category leading SaaS businesses you need to be competitive in the US. There are a lot of European countries who don’t get the success in the US that they hoped for.”
Again timing was important and it was argued that US Market entry needs to be deferred until a clear product market fit has been established, there has been adequate funding and once the market had been seeded first.
“You need to be resource constrained until you get product market fit.”
How you enter the US market was also the topic for much debate and Jos White of Notion Capital shared some valuable insights gained from his experiences with Message Labs.
For many, there was a view that Europeans had an advantage given the fact that the European market is so fragmented compared to the US (languages, currencies, culture etc). For US companies looking to expand in Europe, they often struggled given the more heterogeneous market that we are more used to here.
“Do everything you can to win the US market even it means neglecting your home market. You really want to be the category leader — your sales and marketing efficiency will be way better. US & Canada makes up circa 50% of the world’s global software market.” Nick Franklin and Christoph Janz
Hiring your first head of sales was viewed as being key. However, there was one major challenge with this — in that senior sales people sell themselves very well making it difficult to assess how good they’ll be. Suggestions to overcome this included the need to:
1. Dig really deeply into their resumes.
2. Use your investors who have experience with other companies who have successfully entered the US to support you (perhaps even having them interview candidates).
3. Do extensive reference checks (a step that is often skipped).
4. Go there yourself rather than hire someone (as an alternative).
It was also argued that your solution may need to be pitched a little differently in the US and this was something that need to be tested in terms of value proposition/ web copy / sales collateral.
In the US it is a lot more of an ROI sale than in the EU where the focus is often on ‘whether we have the budget’.
Of course, the capital requirements of a US entry are also a significant factor, and thus the decision is of key strategic importance (and may in most instances necessitate a VC raise).
“It’s a global game, execute on that basis. Don’t be constrained by geographic limits”. Gil Dibner
Finally, some delegates shared stories about how they were able to successfully sell in the US without the need for a domestic sales presence. So very much a case of ‘horses for courses’.
4. Drive Customer Success
A number of speakers spoke about the importance of driving customer success as being a key criteria for growth.
“Customer success is when customers achieve their desired outcome through interaction with your company. Customer success-driven growth is growth that happens because your customers succeed, upgrade, buy more, and tell their friends.” Lincoln Murphy
Murphy went on to argue that successful customers who had achieved their desired outcomes:
Customer success is the new sales — take care of your existing base — Dave Blake, ClientSuccess
Murphy also went onto describe how churn was the symptom of an ‘underlying disease’ and that startups needed to focus on what was causing the churn.
“Companies that embrace customer success as an operating model organise everything from acquisition to first use to company-wide roll-out in a way that makes customers accomplish their goals. These companies are deliberate about the customer journey, know what’s happening at each stop, and can move customers quickly from milestone to milestone. Nothing is left to chance.” Lincoln Murphy
5. Be Comfortable Pivoting
The topic of pivoting also cropped up as speakers shared their respective startup journeys with a number of them talking about how pivoting helped them transform their businesses. Siraj Khaliq, the Co-founder, of The Climate Corporation described how they made two pivots on their path to exit.
Khaliq described how they stayed aware of adjacent opportunities and this helped them pivot successfully despite their being some resistance to the idea.
For me the key point here is that startups make a number of assumptions, on which they base their core business despite the absence of data initially to validate them. Having founders with both the confidence and the ability to pivot when faced with changes to these assumptions, or the emergence of more attractive adjacent opportunities is key.
6. Always Be Testing
The ability of SaaS companies to test is one of the most powerful elements that SaaS startups have at their disposal. As traffic grows, the need to constantly A/B test needs to be a key element for all marketing teams to focus on. Kieran Flanagan of Hubspot, outlined a number of approaches they use ranging from:
i/ Giving the team the confidence to ‘fail fast’
ii/ Prioritizing experiments based on; Priority, Impact, Ease of experiment implementation
iii/ Using a range of different applications from Trello to Google Docs to manage the process.
“Sometimes small things can make a huge difference e.g changing copy on a page. Adding 6 words let to a 20% inc in conversions.” Kieran Flanagan, Hubspot
Regardless of the business size, ensuring processes are in place to constantly engage and talk to customers was viewed as being of crucial importance, alongside the need to make decisions based on data (with a dollop of gut instinct added to the mix). Again having the confidence to make judgements based on intuition and gut feel was viewed as being critical even when faced with data which may indicate a different route should be taken.
7. Increase Your Prices
A number of speakers talked about aligning pricing with value, and that many startups under-priced their offerings.
“Increasing price is a very underrated tactic.”
Both Leo Widrich from Buffer and Nick Franklin from ChartMogul described how they had successfully increased prices for new customers without having any negative effect on the numbers signing up.
“ Don’t give away your product too cheaply. Increase your prices. You don’t have much to lose.” Nick Franklin and Christoph Janz
Sidenote, my article ten key elements to help with your SaaS startup’s pricing strategy elaborates on some of the pricing themes.
8. Ensure you Align Incentives
Drift CEO, David Cancel described his tips for retention recommending that having full clarity on how you are incentivizing your team is a key criteria for success.
“ The most important rule in management — Get the incentives right”. Charlie Munger
Cancel argued that you need to:
He went on to argue that most metrics were not aligned with customers, and that as a result retention suffers. Sales people incentivized to drive leads will do so without giving any consideration as to whether or not they are the right types of leads. Similarly, marketing can fill the sales funnel with the wrong types of leads if their incentives are aligned with growth rather than retention.
9. Don’t Screw Up Your Fundraising
Janz talked about the importance of committing to a fund raising process wholeheartedly ensuring that you created a sufficiently competitive process to increase your leverage.
“ Don’t screw up your fundraising. Create an awesome deck (not just ok). Talk to the right number of investors. Your goal needs to be that you can run a competitive process.” Nick Franklin and Christoph Janz
Again there was a mix of views through out the day as to when and whether to take VC funding. We heard from bootstrap successes like Teamwork as well as VC backed startups like Intercom, and again the perspectives were wide and varied (although there was a significant VC representation at the event who ensured their voices were heard).
10. Ensure your Initial Sales Team Mirror Your Target Market
Siraj Khaliq shared a number of insightful stories about his journey to exit. He talked about the importance of recruiting people from the key market you are selling into. In his case, he was selling to farmers, and their initial senior enterprise sales guy struggled given how different he was from the personas he was trying to sell to.
In summary, the inaugural SaaStock was a resounding success, with great speakers, and panelists, and with lots of fantastic lessons for SaaS startups. The sun shone and the wifi worked fine. I’m looking forward to SaaStock 2017 already.
P.S. Apologies to Peter Coppinger from Teamwork, who despite a brilliant presentation does not get much of a mention above. The theme of his talk was essentially a list of ‘what not to do’ to build a $12m ARR SaaS business, and thus his tips have been omitted so as not to confuse.

The IBM Cloud, Data & AI team is excited to announce that IBM Watson Studio Desktop has been awarded the 2019 SaaS Award in the Best SaaS Product for Non-Profits & Education category. Our design, development, and offering management teams are honored and thrilled to receive this award as a recognition for their diligence and focus.
The SaaS Awards program is now in its fourth year of celebrating software innovations and the successes they create for business. With awards for excellence and innovation in SaaS, the Software-as-a-Service Awards program accepts entries worldwide.
“The standard of entries this year was incredibly high, with consistent attention to innovation and most importantly, customer success. The volume of entries warranting consideration of a place on the coveted shortlist was unprecedented,” Larry Johnson, SaaS Awards and Cloud Awards.
Along with IBM Watson Studio Desktop, we were honored to have three other products selected for the shortlist in the 2019 SaaS Awards: IBM Regulatory Accelerator, IBM Digital App Builder, and IBM Blockchain Platform.
IBM Watson Studio Desktop was created with the goal of streamlining the process of data analysis and modeling. This product is a desktop installable version of IBM Watson Studio for the cloud, giving users an option to store their data locally on their computers as opposed to uploading it to a cloud. It provides an environment designed for users to easily create, train, and manage machine-learning data models.
The experience includes built-in data science tools for tasks such as data preparation and image recognition so that users can streamline their data workflow by having all of their needed tools in one space. These tools are all presented within the product’s unified user experience and available on the users’ desktop as opposed to online, giving users a higher level of security in the case that they are working with sensitive data and prefer to keep it out of a cloud environment. IBM Watson Studio Desktop features an easy installation in Windows or Mac OS, automatic updates once it’s installed, and upholds the highest standards in data security.
The team behind IBM Watson Studio Desktop aimed to create an experience that helped streamline the data science workflow for their users. The team found that their target users were data scientists and specialists who were often dealing with information, resources, and tools scattered across different environments. With many existing data analysis tools, users were also lacking the flexibility to work wherever they needed, which constrained their workflow. Another major issue was the limited number of portable or compatible features across the many different software tools that data scientists used, hindering their ability to efficiently collaborate with colleagues.
The team aimed to design a product that included data tools and capabilities within a cohesive user experience. A challenge was creating an interface that was an extension of IBM Watson Studio so that users could seamlessly transition from cloud to desktop versions of the product. The team had to redesign all the data science and machine learning capabilities of IBM Watson Studio into a desktop tool. This included having to learn a new technical domain of a desktop based interaction so that the team could understand how to recreate a cloud-based user experience for a desktop environment.
“Working with data and creating AI can be time consuming and complex. We designed an experience that seamlessly integrates the tools our users need to simplify their process, and provide the flexibility of working anytime, anywhere.” — Alex Swain, IBM Watson Studio Desktop Design Manager
IBM Watson Studio Desktop provides our data users more options, accessibility, and more of a community. As an extension of the IBM Watson Studio for the cloud, this product opens up the field of data science to more users, making data analysis more accessible to those who may be working with sensitive data that they are unable to upload to the cloud. This product, an addition to the existing cloud platform, also creates more of a community for our data users, as they now have more data analysis options available through our software products without having to transition to completely new environments. We’re thrilled that this product is recognized for its contribution to the education field, as we are always striving to design tools that make complex worlds such as data analysis more accessible and welcoming for our users.
Congrats to the IBM Watson Studio Desktop team for all their hard work in making this a great product for our users.

The Marketing, Sales & Services Metrics to Monitor in Your SaaS KPI Dashboard
Growing any business is difficult. Scaling a Software as a Service (SaaS) company is especially hard. Most SaaS companies struggle to achieve predictable revenue growth and even public SaaS companies struggle to achieve profitability.
To make a SaaS company successful, you can’t just change your software delivery model to the web and expect it all to work. You must make thoughtful, data-driven decisions when it comes to your marketing, sales and services operations.
Why? In comparison to enterprise software firms of yesteryear who could rely on large, up front fees to get a quick payback, SaaS business model relies on small amounts of recurring revenues. The SaaS economic model is unique from almost any other. Unlike a services businesses where you can pay for your new equipment after the first few jobs or a consulting business with no overhead that can close big upfront contracts from the get-go, revenue in a SaaS business is built one small sale at a time, paid in small increments.
This makes SaaS marketing hard because you need to find ways to find and attract a high volume of quality leads and then find ways to increase lead volume for years to come – all on a small budget.
Sans big deals, SaaS sales is hard. You need to find ways to make your salespeople more efficient, so they can close more deals more quickly. But, every investment you make in productivity increases your payback period even further. Further, you can’t afford to hire experienced salespeople to help you figure it out.
SaaS customer success is hard because it’s just another upfront expense you must justify within an already limited budget. But, it’s critical because you might not get any payback on your marketing, sales or services if customers cancel before break-even occurs.
But even though scaling a SaaS company is hard, it’s not impossible. Fortunately for all of us, a few successful SaaS pioneers have shared parts of their playbook. Companies like HubSpot and Marketo invented and then shared their modern marketing and sales playbooks as well as their financials as public companies — leaving little doubt of it’s effectiveness. Zendesk certainly eats their own cooking, showing companies how to manage customer success. Of course, the trailblazer themselves, Salesforce, has shown us what it takes to keep growing and growing. Even relative new comers like Buffer are leading the way, transparently exposing their inner workings even during their adolescent SaaS phase. And of course, we have investors like David Skok and Jason Lemkin who have seen the playbook from inside many a SaaS board room and shared it with the world in detail. And that’s not to mention the services companies like inside sales consulting firm, The Bridge Group and inbound marketing agency Kuno Kreative that have made a name for themselves by helping SaaS companies scale and sharing their best practices in their reports and on their blog.
Together, these companies, investors and consultants have created and named a set of metrics that every SaaS employee would be wise to understand, and every SaaS executive should monitor closely.
Being a data-driven SaaS company ourselves who also helps companies monitor their key performance metrics, we’ve compiled a list of key metrics every SaaS company should track.
We’ve divided them up into three categories: marketing, sales and customer success.
Let’s start with marketing…
Monthly unique visitors is the number of unique individuals visiting your website each month. If a person is visiting the site multiple times, they will be counted as one unique visitor as long as they use the same device and browser for the visits or do not clear their cookies in between visits with the same device and browser. While this metric alone doesn’t provide many insights, it is a great reflection of the size of the audience and is a good measure of the impact of your overall marketing efforts.
By measuring the volume of unique visitors from each source, you can also measure the the effects of all your marketing campaigns and activities. And while growth in unique monthly visitors is a great gauge of the effectiveness of your top of the funnel marketing, don’t forget to look at engagement metrics like average time on site, average pages visited, repeat visits, number of comments, downloaded content, email subscriptions and other such metrics. These metrics will tell you about the quality of your traffic, which is equally important as quality.
Use tools like Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics to measure unique visitors. Unfortunately, HubSpot Analytics does not measure unique visitors. They reason that it’s not a perfect measure since users can delete cookies and use multiple devices. Therefore, they track visits. Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics measure both and since Google Analytics is free, most SaaS companies start there.
Not every SaaS software offers a free trial or a self-service option. Many force you to talk to a salesperson before seeing the software. But, self service is perhaps the best way to lower cost of customer acquisition.
So, for self service SaaS companies, signups is probably the most important metric.
Whether you offer a free trial or a freemium plan, marketing’s goal should be to drive signups.
In an ideal world, the user can learn the software on his/her own, begin using it regularly and find enough value to convert to a paying costumer.
There are many ways to increase signups. We could write a whole blog post just on that. But, the most obvious ones are growing traffic by writing helpful, educational content for both prospective and existing users, and optimizing your website’s conversion rate.
Just like visits, you can use analytics tools like Google, Adobe and HubSpot to measure this metric. But, with more than 20,000 companies monitoring more than 500,000 apps and projects, many SaaS companies turn to Mixpanel to measure user acquisition and track users once they sign up.
Tomasz Tunguz, venture capitalist at Redpoint Ventures, defines PQLs as “potential customers who have used a product and reached pre-defined triggers that signify a strong likelihood to become a paying customer”.
For freemium business models, a PQL is the new MQL or marketing qualified lead. It helps SaaS businesses pre-qualify potential customers based on their product usage.
At Databox, PQLs are one of the most important metrics we track. Our free product allows users to connect with 3 data sources for free, allows up to 3 users and allows access to fewer features than our paid products. We’ve defined PQL criteria for our business based on a user’s interaction (features used, time spent and frequency of usage) with the product. Our developers then run experiments to increase our PQL volume.
Like many other SaaS companies, we determine whether a user meets our PQL thresholds inside of Intercom.
Once you’ve documented your PQL (or MQL) definition, you need to calculate how many you need each month.
Knowing your qualified lead to close ratio (See Sales section below), work backwards from your revenue target to calculate the volume of leads needed. (Here’s a helpful revenue to lead calculator if you want some help running that math.)
All would be great in the world if you could snap your fingers and start generating the lead volume you need to exceed your revenue target. But, since that’s not realistic, plan to increase your lead volume every month, so that you’re comfortably hitting your annual revenue target by the end of the year. In fact, “there’s no reason leads can’t grow every single month like clockwork” says Jason Lemkin, the creator of the LVR ratio.
Why should you obsess over LVR? Since it is just a matter of time before some percentage of your qualified leads close to a customer, LVR is a great indicator of future sales attainment.
To calculate LVR, use the following formula:
As an example, imagine you created 1,100 qualified leads this month and 1,000 qualified leads last month, you are growing LVR at 10% month-over-month. Assuming quality of your leads stayed the same, use your average sales cycle to forecast new sales revenue in future months.
Organic traffic comes from your organic rankings in the search engines, whereas paid traffic comes from Pay-Per-Click (PPC) ads, sponsored links, or purchased ads. But which one drives better results?
Organic search results are 8.5x more likely to be clicked on than paid search results, as searchers consider organic results more trustworthy. Once your content is ranking organically, every click is free too. How can you beat that?
Well, it takes time and effort to grow organic traffic and even then it converts at a bit lower rate than paid clicks.
So, where you invest depends on how quickly you need results and how much money you have. If you need results now and have budget, paid search is the right place to focus. If you don’t need immediate results, focus as much of your time and budget towards content creation to steadily grow organic traffic over time.
Of course, if you intend to be in business in the future, it’s always smart to invest in growing your organic traffic. And companies that have been producing higher volumes of content for longer time periods have a distinct advantage. So, the longer you wait, the harder it’ll be.
If you can do both, do both. Don’t waste money, though — make sure you’re converting your traffic (especially your paid traffic) into revenue.
No matter where you invest, It’s essential to measure the volume of traffic, leads and customers you are generating from your organic and paid traffic channels. You can also gain insight into which keywords or ad campaigns are driving better results and focus more effort and budget on the ones working and less on the ones that aren’t.
To track the performance of your paid and organic channels, you’ll need a few tools to get a full picture. You’ll need an analytics package like HubSpot or Google Analytics to measure your traffic, lead and customer acquisition volume by these sources. Unless you’re selling online, a package like HubSpot will help you track your clicks all the way to revenue. They call it closed loop marketing analytics.
You should also connect with your ad platform to see paid search performance more granularly.
Regarding tracking your organic rankings more closely, Google has made it harder in the last few years to optimize organic search. While there are tools that will report your rank or placement in search engine result pages (SERPs) for each of your target keywords, it’s technically against Google’s terms of service. Google has also encrypted many SERPs so that analytics packages (including their own) no longer report traffic by keyword for many searches. Instead, focus on optimizing volume of organic search in the beginning. Explore using services like SEMRush, Ahrefs, Moz and Google’s own Search Console once you’ve made some traction.
Word of mouth marketing can not be beat. When your customers help you acquire new customers, growth can be exponential.
Perfected by consumer internet companies as early as hotmail.com (before it was bought by Microsoft), Airbnb and Gmail, as well as newer internet software darlings like Dropbox, Slack and every successful social network ever, virality is every SaaS startup’s dream.
To measure virality, calculate your viral coefficient. The formula is simple:
Invites = Number of invitations the average user sends.Conversion percent = The percentage of invitees that convert to customers
As an example, a virality coefficient of 1.5 means that every signup brings 0.5 additional signups, so for 100 signups, you actually get 150. The greater your viral coefficient, the faster and faster your company will grow.
To model your viral growth rate, download this calculator from David Skok’s blog.
At Databox, a few months ago, we pivoted from an outbound, enterprise sales model to an inbound, freemium-driven model selling to a wider range of company sizes. Our development team has had a huge impact already on our revenue generation and we plan to improve it even more by tracking and improving the metrics below.
Depending on how you’ve defined your marketing and sales process, you might have different definitions for different types of leads. You might have subscribers who simply subscribed to your blog, leads that simply filled out a form on your website to download an ebook, marketing qualified leads who fit a strict definition of “fit” and “interest” based on how they’ve interacted with your site and what you know about the contact and their company, or product qualified leads who are using parts of your free product. You might even use all of these definitions.
At Databox, we pay closest attention to the number of PQLs who convert to customers, but we also measure the overall number of new users who convert to customer too. As an example, we measure our PQL to customer conversion rate as the percentage of PQLs that end up converting to paid customers. Here’s our simple formula:
Whatever lead to customer conversion rate you measure, make sure you define different lead types and consistently calculate your conversion rates.
Your conversion rate is a benchmark for how good a job you are doing at turning leads into customers. By increasing your conversion rate to customer, you’re directly increasing your revenue.
To measure your conversion rates, many companies use a marketing automation platform like HubSpot or Marketo and/or a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. We’re pulling PQL volume from Intercom.io and pulling sales data from Stripe, then doing the calculation inside Databox.
Average Revenue per Account (ARPA), also known as Average Revenue per User or per Unit (ARPU), is a measure of the revenue generated per account, usually per month as most subscription businesses operate monthly. But you can always calculate it yearly or quarterly according to your plans and billing options.
A simple way to calculate this is to divide the total MRR you have at the end of a month and divide it by the number of active customers at that time, like so:
A good practice is measuring ARPA for new and existing customers separately, to have a sense of how your ARPA is evolving or if new customers behave differently compared to existing ones. Some companies also calculate this as average sales price (ASP) to separate the impact of upselling from the price at the initial sale.
To track your ARPA, you need to rely on your billing or accounting system. Many SaaS companies use Stripe to manage billing, but you need to pull data from Paypalor Quickbooks if you are using those systems too. If you’re using multiple payment methods, and have not consolidated your data into a centralized accounting system, you might need to pull from multiple systems and add the numbers together.
David Skok calls CAC “The Startup Killer,” as a very large number of startups have failed (even those that solved the Product/Market fit problem) because they did not find a way to acquire customers at a low enough cost. Understanding how much it costs to acquire new customers and identifying the most profitable marketing and sales channels is the key to profitably scaling a SaaS business.
To calculate it, divide your total sales and marketing cost by the number of deals closed within a given period. If you’re following an inside, channel or field sales model, make sure to include salaries. If your product sells itself without salespeople, where you don’t need to grow your headcount as fast as customer acquisition scales, you can calculate your costs without the headcount costs.
Follow this formula:
A viable business model for a SaaS company comes down to balancing two variables: 1) CAC and 2) the ability to monetize those customers (or LTV; which stands for Lifetime Value of a Customer). In an unbalanced business model CAC exceeds LTV, where in a balanced model CAC is significantly smaller than LTV.
Skok gives us two rough rules of thumb regarding CAC:
Per Skok, CAC changes drastically based on the complexity of your selling model. Freemium or No Touch self-service business models have CAC between $0 and $200. Light & High touch inside sales inflate CAC to between $300 and $8,000, and with a field sales team your CAC can go from $20,000 to even up to $200,000.
To reduce CAC, try A/B testing to improve conversion rates, minimize the level of touch required to complete a sale, or by making your product easier to understand more quickly via an improved trial process.
To calculate CAC, you’ll need to aggregate all of your costs from something like Quickbooks or by manually tracking in a spreadsheet. Also, you’ll need to track the number of new paid users you acquire during each period.
Recurring revenue is the lifeblood of any SaaS business. The MRR is a single and consistent number to track, no matter how many pricing plans and billing cycles you have.
But how do you calculate MRR?
The easiest way is to summarize all the revenue you receive from your paying customers per month. Another way is also to multiply the total number of paying customers by the average revenue per user (ARPU).
For example, say you have 5 customers. Three of them are paying $100/month, one is paying $200/month and one is paying $960/year. First, the yearly billing period needs to be normalized into a monthly amount (dividing by 12, which is in this case $80/month). MRR in this example is $580 ((3 x $100) + $200 + $80). When divided by the number of customers (5), you get the ARPU ($116 in this case).
While that calculation sounds simple (and it is), SaaS companies need to calculate multiple MRR numbers, depending on the complexity of their business. For example, all SaaS companies should measure New MRR and Churned MRR to calculate Net MRR. If you’ve built a pricing and packaging strategy that enables you to generate additional revenue from existing customers, you should calclate add-on MRR and factor that into NET MRR too. Here’s a list of different MRR numbers you should calculate:
If you measure a higher Churn MRR than your New MRR, you are likely losing as many customers as you are gaining each month. That is a recipe for going out of business fast.
When your Add-on MRR is higher than your Churn MRR, that means you’ve figured out how to have positive retention (or negative churn). This means enough of your existing customers are upgrading, countering the revenue lost from the customers who are cancelling. In this scenario, the average new customer you acquire will grow.
Money companies focus more on measuring Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). As you’d imagine, ARR is the annual value of recurring revenue and means Monthly recurring rate multiplied by 12. Once you achieve positive retention rates, ARR gives you an estimation of how much revenue you’ll generate in a year, not including customers you’ll likely book during the remainder of the year.
One of the crucial parts of managing your customer relationships is keeping track of how your services team is performing. Customer Success is the foundation for every SaaS company, and excellent customer service is one of the biggest driving forces behind it.
The services team is also a linchpin between many of your teams. They work with sales to drive upsells, cross sells and renewals. They work with marketing to do product marketing. They help sales ensure that expectations are set properly with customers before they buy and they work with the product team to identify ways to improve or enhance the product. Because they are such a critical team, it’s important to ensure they’re focused on the customer, first and foremost. The following metrics will ensure that focus.
It’s inevitable to receive a certain number of complaints, questions and suggestions from your customers.
The number of support tickets created is a measure of how many customers are requesting help. Better than just tracking an absolute number of support tickets, you should keep an eye on the trend of average numbers of daily, weekly and monthly tickets, to respond in case you see an escalation of tickets. A good practice is to tag tickets by types (bugs, feature requests, questions, suggestions and other). If you stay organized like with tags, you’ll be able to quickly determine whether’s there’s a problem, usability issues or just active customers requesting new capabilities, when ticket volume inevitably spikes.
Use a service like Zendesk or Helpscout to monitor your support ticket volume. We track tickets created via Intercom chat.
Average first response time is the average amount of time it takes for Customer Support to respond to a case after it’s submitted by a requester (customer).
Because people don’t like waiting to have their problems solved, average first reply time correlates with customer satisfaction. In other words, the lower your average first response time, the more satisfied and engaged your customers will be.
Plan your staffing carefully to scale with your customer count. When SaaS companies are growing quickly, it’s a mistake to underestimate future support ticket volume. When planning your budget, hire and train support people before you need them.
To track average response time, use your help desk software. Investigate when you see response time lag.
While it’s important to respond to users quickly, it’s critical to resolve issues quickly. Average resolution time is the average time it takes your Support team to completely resolve or “close” a ticket. It is a stronger corollary to customer satisfaction and retention than first response time. After all, it doesn’t matter how quickly you respond to a ticket, if you don’t resolve the tickets too.
Calculate with the following formula if your software doesn’t calculate it for you:
You can measure customer satisfaction using customer surveys, and in particular, the Net Promoter Score. NPS is the most popular metric to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty. But don’t just use NPS to measure your customers’ happiness with your products. Customer ratings are also necessary to evaluate your support team’s effectiveness. Also, it’s smart to measure your NPS after product updates to see which changes triggered a positive or negative response.
The NPS tells us the likelihood of a person to recommend a company or its product to someone else. NPS typically uses the 0-10 scale, where 0 means they won’t ever recommend the product and 10 means they definitely would. The higher your NPS the better, as it indicates satisfied users, who will likely stay with you over time.
Three categories of people can be distinguished: Detractors (a 0 to 6 score), Passives (a 7 or 8 score) and Promoters (respondents giving a 9 or 10 score). Calculating NPS isn’t as simple as averaging the ratings. So, use software to do it.
There are many tools that help you for measure and calculate your NPS: Drift, Delighted and Promoter.io.
Probably obviously, active users means the number of people that are actively using your product. This metric is a benchmark to determine the health of a SaaS company’s customer base. More usage by more users is a strong sign of a healthy SaaS app.
But since usage patterns and frequency is appropriately different for different companies, there’s no universal measure of “good” vs “bad” usage. In other words, every company must define the usage that defines an active user. Is it certain features? Is it certain features used at a certain frequency? Must active users use a combination of features to be considered active? Unfortunately, there’s no standard answers; every company is different.
As a best practice, you should define a user “active” when they do something from which they have derived undeniable value. For most apps, that means they should do something beyond just logging in, before counting them as active.
Depending on your business, you might want to define usage different for your mobile and webapp. At Databox, our “Active users” metric is split into “Active Webapp Users” and “Active Mobile users”, as we count those separately as usage patterns are very different in each app. Users tend to configure datacards and datawalls inside our web app, while they tend to view them more frequently in our mobile app. For example, An Active Webapp User has done something of the following: created, edited, deleted, duplicated, reordered, or renamed a Datacard or Datawall, invited a user, made any changes to Datacards or Datawalls in the Designer, connected a new data source, previewed a Datacard or Datawall. An Active Mobile User has not only opened the app, but also viewed alerts, favorites, notifications, messages or scrolled/swiped on any of the Datacards.
Active users can be measured as Daily active users (DAU), Weekly active users (WAU) or Monthly active users (MAU) as the amount of unique users who are “active” within a given amount of time. Improvement in these numbers is a good signal that you’re business is moving in the right direction. These numbers can help you identify the impact of key initiatives, including new marketing channels, sales approaches and product enhancements.
But, some call DAU and MAU vanity metrics. Holding nothing back, Mixpanel calls them “Bullshit metrics”. They argue that a better indicator of success is retention, which tells you how sticky your product is, and how many users return to it after their first experience. One way to measure “stickiness”, though is to divide your daily active users by your monthly active users, as in the formula below:
A DAU/MAU ratio of 50% means your customers return 15 out of 30 days in a month. If it makes sense that your software should be a daily habit, this is an excellent metric to calculate.
It’s quite obvious that you should build a product that people love and use. You won’t renew deals if your customers don’t use your product.
Customer retention rate can be defined as a metric that indicates the proportion of customers that have continued to use your product for a while. The opposite of Retention is Customer Churn, also known as customer attrition. To calculate customer retention rate at the close of a month, look at repeat orders from repeat customers in the past month, and compare these orders to number from two months before. (Do not count new customers you acquired in the previous month.)
For example, if the number of customers subscribed at the beginning of last month is 200 and the customers customers who continued subscribing at the end of last month is 170, the customer retention rate is 170 / 200 or 85%.
Churn rate is the proportion of customers or subscribers who leave during a given time period. “Churn is a measure of how efficient a company is at retaining customer revenue” (as explained in The Maximum Viable Churn Rate For A Startup by Tomasz Tunguz.
It is often an indicator for customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, aggressive and successful marketing from the competition, or reasons outside of your control like business failure or strategy shifts. Some customer churn is to be expected. But, the greater the churn, the more capital is required for the business just to maintain its revenue. Churn can quickly sink a SaaS company.
What is a good churn rate? Some sectors have significantly higher rates of customer churn than others. For SaaS companies, a 3% or lower churn is considered to be good. SaaS companies that sell to smaller businesses should expect higher churn, while SaaS companies that sell to enterprises should strive for very low customer churn.
Acquiring new customers is usually way more expensive than retaining existing ones. So, keep a sharp eye on the customer churn rate and identify the reasons for it. Get in touch with your previous users and try to get as much info as you can why they are leaving. Get ahead of churn by defining the usage levels that correlate to retention and do your best to drive customers to that level of usage. Always seek new ways to deliver more value to your customers as a way to improve retention.
Your goal should eventually be to achieve negative revenue churn. To accomplish this, prevent customers from unsubscribing while also finding ways to increase revenue from your existing customers. The increased revenue from existing customers should offset the revenue lost when others cancel. Negative churn happens when this expansion revenue from existing customers is higher than lost revenue from churning customers. This is the case when your existing customers expand their use of your product by purchasing add-ons, upgrading to higher plans and increasing their Lifetime Value to such an extent that it makes up for any revenue lost to other customers churning. If a company loses 5% of customers to churn each month, but the 95% of remaining customers are so successful (i.e. customer retention is only 95%) with the product that they purchase additional services, increasing their spend by 5%, revenue retention would be 110% compared to the previous month.
To calculate churn, you must use data from your accounting and/or CRM system. Ideally, these two systems are integrated, so that you can pull data from either place.
Customer Lifetime Value is one of the most important metrics for understanding your customers. For some, it’s the only one that matters. It helps you make business decisions about Sales, Marketing, Product Development, and Customer Support.
First, we need to calculate out Customer Lifetime which is:
If you have a monthly Churn rate, then the Lifetime will be for the same time period (in months). Let’s take two examples: If your monthly customer Churn is 5%, then your Customer Lifetime is 20 months (1 / 0.05). If you take the 25% annual customer churn rate, your Customer Lifetime is 4 years (1 / 0.25).
Once we have the Customer Lifetime, we can calculate our Customer LTV. The simplest formula is:
If your ARPA is $100 and the Customer Lifetime is 20 months, we get the LTV which is $2000.
As you can see, Churn has a direct impact on LTV. If you can halve your churn rate, it will double your LTV.
The LTV is also important in discovering if a business model for a SaaS company is viable or not. In an out-of-balance business model CAC exceeds LTV, whereas in a balanced model CAC is significantly less than LTV.
If these KPIs are the important metrics for your business, you may want to be able to check them anytime, anywhere – in the middle of the night, if needed. And you also want to know if something changes, when it changes and why it changes.
However, that’s hard for most SaaS businesses given the number of software systems most use. At Databox, we sometimes feel like we spend as much time building software to run our SaaS business as we do working on the SaaS product we sell. Obviously for us, we don’t have to do that for reporting. And we don’t think you should either.
With Databox, you can pull all your dispersed data quickly into one place, and have all your data available wherever you want it (accessible on your mobile phone, desktop, Apple Watch, office screen, or even inside Slack). There are hundreds of datasources that work out of the box, you can connect to any SQL database like AWS Redshift, MySQL… or bring your data from spreadsheets or custom built software behind your firewalled applications.
You can even get a daily or weekly scorecard with your most important KPIs and for more dynamic metrics, you can define a set of alerts which let you be the first to know when something goes wrong or when something goes wonderfully!

Be the first to respond.
This is the only way I know how to do it…
Behind every great SaaS success story, there’s a great VP of Sales. From Jim Herbold (formely Box) to Sam Blond (Zenefits), we read daily about the SaaS sales leaders that are driving astronomical revenue growth for their companies. But before you can become the sales leader of a Lemkin worthy SaaS unicorn (er, decacorn), you need to first make the jump from wherever you are now to your first SaaS VP of Sales position.
And lets be honest. It’s going to be a jump.
There’s no lock-step path to VP Sales glory. It’s all too new (for now). Sure, if you’re at Oracle or SFDC there is probably a great VP career track (that just wasn’t my path). But out here in the rough streets of Silicon Valley, getting a real shot at being a VP of Sales for an up and coming SaaS start-up takes more than just strong tech sales/management experience (but you need that in spades, of course).
So the big question is how do you become a first-time SaaS VP of Sales?
In my experience, there are two components to getting there (Spoiler: this isn’t 7-minute abs. This sh*t is hard!).
Here you go…
#1 Know how to identify a great opportunity before everyone else does.
#2 Understand SaaS sales metrics (the ones that matter) better than the CEO.
Let’s dive into these:
Now that sh*t doesn’t just sound hard, it sounds next to impossible without your uncle @pmarca feeding it to you. But it’s actually not that hard, if you know what you’re looking for. More importantly though, this may be your one shot at getting there — so let’s map it out.
You can determine if a below the radar SaaS company could rocket under your leadership with strong answers to the following questions:
a. Do they have an ARR between $1mm and $5mm?: Below that you’re taking a risk on Product Market Fit, and above that, someone smart is going to tell them to hire a proven VP of Sales, not a punk kid like you.
b. Average ACV >$3,000 and <$10,000?: Below $3,000 can be just fine (see this ACV list on Quora), but if they are already mildy killing it, then they probably should hire a director of marketing from Slack into a CMO role, and not you. Above $10,000, you’re going to be too late to the party. If they are already doing >$1mm at a $10K ACV, someone more experienced than you has already found them.
c. <30% Churn?: Here’s the deal. VC’s are going to say above 20% makes them nervous, and below 10% is on the right track. Fortunately, you’re not a VC, but you do need to arrive before they do, which means taking a gamble on a higher churn rate. Anything under 30% means that the company is on to something. With time, the product can get stickier and the CS teams can get better — and that churn number will go down. >30% and you’re taking a risk that Product Market Fit isn’t there yet. That may be a risk you’re willing to take if other factors are inline, but if buyers are dropping off too regularly, how meaningful of a solution could this company have really built?
d. Product Market Fit: While others may disagree, my determination of product market fit is 100% contingent upon strong answers to the questions (a) (b) and (c) above. There can be Product Market Fit below $1mm ARR, and before (b) and (c) have arrived, but I’m not smart enough to see it.
e. Profitable: If they are profitable (even if just barely), and meet the revenue criteria in (a) and (b) above, that probably means that they’ve never had to take (much) cash — and have (mostly) bootstrapped. This is a great sign. If they are looking for a VP of Sales, it’s probably reluctantly-so because they know it’s going to be expensive and they’ve gotten this far without you. It also means you’re going to have your work cut out for you once you land the job. But trust me, these guys need you the most.
f. Strong Product Team: If they’ve never really had a VP of Sales (just that one VP of Biz Dev who was good at “opening doors”), that can be good news for you (not as good as if they’ve hired two who’ve failed). What’s not good news is if they don’t have a kick-ass product team. You can do lot’s of great things as a VP of Sales — but building a great product AND figuring out how to sell it, ain’t one of them (that’s called being a CEO — don’t do it!).
How you can determine if the product team is great is pretty simple. Double check the metrics from (a) (b) and (c), then demo the product (looking closely at the UX and implementation process). If it looks great, functions intuitively, and the person/team who built it looks like they haven’t slept in 2 months, you’ve got something.
g. At least one sales rep who is killing it: This should be your favorite person in the entire world. This is the guy who despite an imperfect product, despite the implementation SNAFUs, the messed up pricing, the delayed invoicing, and zero marketing support, has found a way to crush sales. What this means is that with an improved everything else, some recruiting, some training, and a revamped sales process, you might just flip the revenue switch over night (I mean, like 90 days).
Bonus: Two things that shouldn’t distract you:
When evaluating a SaaS opportunity based on the criteria above, there are two common distractions that can lead you off course:
Whatever you do, don’t run away based on these two criteria. These are SaaS red herrings that are going to send your VP of Sales competition running for the hills — which is exactly where you want them to be.
During Shep Maher’s first year at GuideSpark, they had 7 inbound leads and grew 300%. Watch him tell that story here.
At my current company, LawRoom, they nailed (a)-(g) on my checklist, but the website was (and still is) er, not great. It turns away prospects and candidates every day (our new website is launching in June) — but it’s such a temporary problem compared to, say, Product Market Fit, that it’s critical that you don’t get distracted by it.
This is actually what the site looks like now (my mom was NOT impressed):
Once you’ve identified a target based on the criteria above, your goal now is to demonstrate to the CEO that you’re the right person for the job. And in this new frontier of SaaS, it’s unlikely that your resume is going to do the trick (you would have stopped reading paragraphs ago, if that were true).
So you really have two goals: (1) master SaaS metrics, and (2) figure out how to show it.
Remember when I said this sh*t was going to be hard. This is the hard part, and where most of you will drop off.
To master SaaS sales metrics, you just need to read every damn blog post ever written about SaaS — twice.
Here’s your first semester reading list:
www.saastr.com
While your future CEO is busy juggling a million things to stay above water — you’re about to ask to be the highest paid employee in the company. You better have a freakin’ plan. The solution that your future CEO is looking for is a VP of Sales with a playbook. Fortunately for you, the playbook is out there. You just need to master it.
Now, and lastly, for the fun part. You have to take this abundance of SaaS knowledge, and you have to make the sales pitch of your life to your future CEO with it. Your future CEO who has probably never hired a true VP of Sales before. Your future CEO who may not know how to comp you, how to measure your productivity, what goals are realistic for you in the first 90/180 days. Your future CEO who may think carrying a bag is the best approach (“just to make sure you can pay for yourself”) because he/she can’t fathom how you’re about to drive revenue quickly and meaningfully.
And that pitch has to be compelling. It has to show an almost scholarly understanding of his/her problems at $Xmm in ARR, and an almost prophetic vision of how to grow 2X, 3X, 4x in revenue.
If you’re familiar with The Challenger Sale — this is commercial teaching 101 (chapters 4–6 for the super serious out there), and the blueprint for how you should present your SaaS playbook to your future CEO.
That’s it. The 1, 2 punch.

In some ways, the “local maximum” for SaaS companies was 2015. Valuations as a multiple of revenues, both for public companies and startups, peaked back then.
But revenues didn’t peak. SaaS recurring revenues have just grown from there. Even if multiples have retreated a bit, it almost doesn’t matter. Because many of the best SaaS companies have doubled or tripled their revenues since then.
Fast forward to 2018, and we’ve now got 5 SaaS Decacorns and another 7 worth $5b or more.
This is a big change in the evolution of SaaS. I remember when Accel invested $60m into Atlassian at a $360m valuation. I loved the Atlassian products and was a long time customer, but it seemed like an insanely large round (and bet) at the time. Fast forward to today, and Atlassian is worth almost 30x that. $11 billion.
And as long as the good times last, we should add more decacorns to the list. Veeva and others should grow into Decacorns, and Dropbox and Slack and others are potential candidates in the not-too-distant future. And companies like Adobe with huge valuations have become SaaS companies.
This should keep the VC taps running, and Private Equity engines running, and the general SaaS ecosystem thriving, and M&A potential at least interesting — at least as long as the market stays strong.
Hope and confidence are important but fragile things. But for every decacorn, at least when times are good — there can be 10–20 unicorns that can hope to become them. That makes room for 100+ SaaS unicorns today (wow). And for every unicorn, there can be 10–20 $100m+ valuation SaaS startups working and hoping to get there. That makes room in the market for 1000–2000 SaaS startups worth $100m+ or more (!)
Good times, indeed.

Okay, I promised to explain how a regular developer can built something profitable from scratch and it’s time to deliver on that promise. As in my previous articles, we’re not gonna build the next Google this time. And I don’t feel Vitalik Buterin-ish enough (and, frankly, am not that smart) to create something as awesome as Ethereum. Instead, let’s try and dive into a fun, beautiful, and modestly profitable niche. Which one and how? Well, here the story begins. Radical transparency mode ON.
I’ve always been a proponent of the principle that sourcing business ideas shouldn’t be a serendipity. It’s a skill that can be developed and improved just like any other ability. One day I tweeted this:
So let’s try our own medicine and sift through Fiverr’s gigs. But I have a thing for social media marketing and image generation, so let’s explore what Fiverr has to offer here first. Oh, and we’re not going to logo making section; the niche is too competitive.
See those grey numbers in parentheses at the right of the rating’s stars? That’s how often people order a particular gig. So we have a clear opportunity here; a business offer that could be automatized thus disrupting this niche. Yes, I’m talking about making quote images for small businesses.
The quick research showed that quotes is one of the most popular content formats for social media. And not without a reason: it can be produced fast, its components usually not protected by any copyright, and most people love it.
Why does this format matter? Because it’s ever-green. That means quote images as a format will still be here for a long time.
It also fits into a pretty standard pricing table of a SaaS:
All this research makes it possible to formulate a mission and a proposal of our SaaS: sell packages of unique quote image content with the client’s branding, tailored for a particular social network. It has a clear value for a user as they would solve their content sourcing problem at once and also promote their brand by having their logo on the content.
Let’s get to work.
To make a good quote image we need four things:
Quotes can be collected on quote websites; services like Unsplash provides free photos for backgrounds; there are tons of beautiful typefaces available as well. So let’s focus on the crucial part of our web service, the image generator.
If you’ve read my previous articles, perhaps, you are aware that I’m not a big fan of hip complicated tools, so for the job of images generating we will use PHP and ImageMagick. These tools are robust, fast enough, and simple.
Let’s not go too deep into the code itself, it’s too specific and, probably, plain boring. Here is what I had after a week of coding:
Looks good, huh? After having this I decided to take it a little further and make animated GIF and videos as well by combining single images into a sequence and packing it into a GIF or MP4 file. For the latter I used the FFmpeg library. Eventually I could make such content in bulk:
That looked cool but it still wasn’t a product. To make it an MVP I had to add the following entities.
Website itself. I decided to build it on Laravel — a popular and well-tested PHP framework — and it turned out to be a great decision. Despite having some issues…
…eventually I figured it out and the framework ceased to be a liability and become an asset.
Here is what I came up with as the order editor:
Payment processing. In order to be a SaaS we should get paid, right? Perhaps, if I were incorporated in a first-world country I’d use Stripe. But here in Russia it’s not available yet. Besides, I like taxation of this country (6% income tax, pretty lax, if you ask me). So the only good option available was Paypal. Despite their long audit they’re pretty convenient, by the way.
Making images in bulk. Our users are interested in packages, not single images, remember? Fortunately, Laravel has a good queue processor which I used to make images one-by-one and packing it into a single zip archive afterwards.
Collection of text quotes and backgrounds. To produce unique quote image content we need enough quotes and images to form random matches. That means that any quote should match with any background perfectly. I’d added 500 quotes and images, made a simple generator to make thousands of random matches, and carefully reviewed all of them. Backgrounds that weren’t perfect matches 100% of the time had been removed.
Landing page. There are Lao Tzu’s treatise-sized volumes written on that subject, so I don’t feel in position to explain how to make a perfect LP. However, here are some quick check list:
Stats and logging. I can’t emphasize enough the importance of in-depth statistics. Anything that can be accounted should be accounted. It’s not necessarily to be a complex system with polished charts. Just a SQL table would suffice as long as it’s thorough enough.
By the way, if you for some reason can’t implement such stats, at the very least, use something on the frontend. Your decisions ought to be data-driven, so you need some data to drive them (okay, okay, a bad pun).
Server. Image generation is a costly process, so I decided to rent out a server from Hetzner. They offer the best bang for the buck and that allowed me to postpone having fun with deploying my app to several servers. I know, it’s a bad practice to have a web server and a queue worker on the same machine but in the beginning it’s fine.
It took me two months to get everything ready to launch. So, let’s see where it takes us?
If there is a perfect place to launch new products, it’s ProductHunt. I didn’t even bother to look for a hunter with a lot of followers this time. All I did was just hunting it myself and having a royal full-night sleep.
This launch has brought me not only great feedback but also some paying customers.
Here is what a ProductHunt induced traffic spike looked like. QuoteBooth took something like 25th place on the main page.
What’s more important than this validation is that one client has ordered MP4 files instead of plain images without any nudging. That means animated quotes can sell themselves pretty well.
Now, when we got our first sales what should we do next? Right, let’s make an incremental improvement iteration.
Motivational quotes are pretty much universal format which fits many verticals, since most people love their pep up effect.
However we can achieve much more market coverage by offering vertical-specific quote images. That may sound difficult but in reality what I did was just ordering to collect quotes and backgrounds on Upwork.
I decided to test two specific verticals and one general: travel, fashion, and love.
There were one more thing that my clients asked me about all the time, a tool for making their own design templates for quotes. So I’d built it in too:
There are a lot of room for improvement but that should be enough to keep me busy for a while.
The most obvious steps could be:
From my estimations QuoteBooth can easily hit $10000/mo in revenue, and I already have ideas derived from this project.
Thanks for reading, I hope it was useful.

Memoirs written by people in their mid-thirties tend to involve tales of hard living, steamy scandals, and other salacious subject matter, but Grant Miller’s story is one of a misspent youth struggling with…enterprise software product requirements. “Struggle” may be the wrong word, as he and his co-founder, Marc Campbell, managed to make themselves millionaires nine months after founding their first company together, but along with this new venture, Replicated (#ProudInvestor), Miller hopes to help founders enjoy a smoother path to success.
His autobiography takes the form of EnterpriseReady.io, a collection of resources that help SaaS founders understand the complex product requirements that come with selling to established businesses. He’s identified 11 features an application must have to be adopted broadly by large clients:
At EnterpriseReady.io readers will find how-to guides and case studies that demonstrate successful deployments for each of these items. But beyond this laundry list, Grant has identified a few broad mindsets that founders can benefit from, even those who might be years away from pursuing enterprise sales.
The most pernicious problem Miller sees is a belief among elite technical founders that big companies are dumb, or at least seriously behind the times. “The funny thing is that many founders don’t want huge potential customers like ‘stodgy banks’ using their apps, only cool, hip companies,” says Miller—though these founders may change their tunes when they need to live up to the ambitious valuations they accepted while fundraising.
These beliefs, by and large, are rooted in some truth. Behemoth corporations don’t adopt modern frameworks or design patterns rapidly. New UI paradigms take years to trickle into their products if they ever do. But these complaints miss the bigger picture. Massive conglomerates earned their size because they have built many successful lines of business that are in the market, producing revenue, and likely…profits. By default, these companies are more risk averse and more interested in protecting the status quo. On the other hand, startups are actively trying to exploit change to disrupt the status quo to create the market opportunity they need to thrive. For startups to be successful working with large enterprise customers, they have to recognize these inherent differences in perspective.
Miller adds that it isn’t just about risk aversion, “Founders often don’t appreciate the large differences in priority that comes with massive scale,” says Miller. “When a company has 100,000 employees, they can’t be managed the same way they would be at a 10-person or even a 100-person startup.” He points to Team Management, Single Sign-On and Role Based Access Control as examples of how enterprises need applications to be administered differently. A two person team might be happy to share usernames & passwords to access 10–20 applications (even then it’s a bad idea). But, for enterprises trying to engage tens or hundreds of users with an application, they can’t even think about managing each of their users in each of the proprietary user management systems for each application, there are just too many to manage manually.
Large corporations aren’t stupid; they just have a different set of constraints that many startup teams won’t truly appreciate unless they’ve run a large enterprise IT department (or struggled with meeting the requirements of these companies for years).
As iterated above, enterprises are not just large SMBs. Founders are often surprised by how much of the sales process is done through a champion inside of the enterprise organization versus a more direct process to a decision maker inside of a small business. Simultaneously selling to many stakeholders inside of a large organization — end users, corporate IT, finance, just to name a few — creates challenges compared to speaking directly with a person who will use your product and holds the credit card.
As a result, SaaS companies looking to move up market into the enterprise have to enable the people inside of large enterprises to spread the product horizontally and sell it up through their organization. It isn’t just about satisfying a single type of user’s direct business needs (though that is the first step) but the next step is to be able to meet the needs of all of the adjacent parties. For example, features like product security to pacify the CISO and audit logs to appease the compliance officer can go a long way in communicating that a startup “gets it”.
Beyond just building these features, SaaS companies should document how these features work in the form of marketing collateral that can be shared within an organization. Founders need to get comfortable allowing 3rd parties to push their product. Instead of wordsmithing every bit of copy, entrepreneurs need to orient their marketing to the multiple different audiences inside of a large organization, this means developing a wide variety of collateral in the form of PDFs and PowerPoint decks. These resources allow an internal champion to communicate effectively with other parts of their organization about the areas that each is concerned.
Once the deal is closed, and the customer is onboarding, Miller advises that SaaS companies think about how they can accelerate the career of their champion within these enterprises. Often these advocates have risked their hard earned relationship capital within their organization to support new technologies. One key he suggests is to embrace and provide air cover back to the champion by providing advanced reporting functionality to prove the business case & ROI that has been unlocked by the adoption of the product.
One warning: listen to and learn from these sherpas, but don’t let them design your software. You will hear dozens of feature requests from customers, but it’s the job of a great product person to sift through those ideas and to build generalizable tools that can be sold across multiple enterprises. EnterpriseReady can help give product leaders distinct buckets in which they can group feature requests to understand if they are common requests or just the personal preference of a specific customer. Often the biggest challenge is just being on the same page with the various parties within an organization as to what their requirements are. Find a common vernacular and specific example that you can reference when taking feature requests.
Selling to the enterprise can be equal parts frustrating and lucrative. As easy as it is to poke fun at boring old behemoths, entrepreneurs should empathize with them — after all, the goal is to become one.

Slack makes work more enjoyable. It’s beautiful. Intuitive. Extremely easy to use. And, about to interconnect the SaaS ecosystem & define the future of work. Slack isn’t only a messaging app — it’s a command centre for interacting with nearly anything: services, building experiences through conversations between you and your customers, a search engine to request information, or share, mix, and save intel to relevant channels, and a medium that can provide the foundation for broad A.I. adoption. Slack Bots are personified software — A medium between technology & humans.
Slack bots are the ultimate interface to enable human-like interactions that will fundamentally change the experience between people & software.
The potential of Slack Bots is huge. So, there’s no surprise that Slack has launched an $80M investment fund for its Bot Platform. Why and how will Slack have an impact on the future of business? Here are 8 predictions for the coming era of Slack Bots & how they will connect the SaaS ecosystem.
Ben Brown wrote a brilliant piece describing how Slack will act as an operating system for your business. The same way Apple enabled the “app experience” on the iPhone through their iOS, Slack will enable the “message experience” through their interface. Ben Brown describes this as “messaging experience design”. It’ll be the basis for how companies will build Slack Bots using messaging as the experience to connect users to any SaaS service. In other words, you’ll just need to have your desktop Slack application open to access, type commands, request, or interface with Bots that are at your service. Bots are the new App that connect the SaaS ecosystem:
These apps will use Slack as their primary user interface, and thus be available on all platforms, and appear natively as if they were built into Slack, and provide all sorts of features that otherwise might live in a web, desktop or mobile application.
Interacting with Slack Bots wouldn’t be much fun if they didn’t have personified characteristics with quirky personalities. The same way Amazon Echo has Alexa as a persona, all Slack Bots will likely have their own, too. In a previous post I talked about the next wave of startups and instead of saying the “Uber of X”, all you need to do is “Just add A.I.”. The rise of A.I. startups and their “Bots” are already happening:
Now you can see how easy it is to connect the dots between Slack Bots and A.I. personas of Apps that are how you interface with services. The combination of Slack’s rapid growth and the rise of Slack Bots will ultimately drive organic adoption of A.I. services with users barely realizing it. Just have browse through the Bot store and add one to your channel.
Marketers are about to have a hay day with the new ways of engaging with employees, customers, and prospects through the messaging experience. That’ll naturally lead to someone coining a new marketing term — something along the lines of “Conversational Marketing”. But, since conversations are the basis for any relationship, I think the credit goes to Drift for coining “Relationship Marketing”. Hat tip to David Cancel & Elias Torres.
Conversational & relationship marketing will drive better customer experiences because it’ll make interactions in real time scale. Easier, and more enjoyable to have, too. Sometimes you might be talking to a human, and sometimes a Bot. I don’t think it’ll matter — the personalities of the Bots may be more enjoyable that speaking to real human anyway. That’ll be the power of combining Slack Bots + Channels + A.I. + Messaging Experience.
You probably already have apps running in the background on your phone helping to automate your life. John Meulemans wrote a cool piece on this, “Why an Invisible App Will Be Your New BFF”:
Think of apps that you won’t have to open in order to use them. Apps that talk to you, like magic, through notifications and API’s of your favourite apps like FB Messenger, Slack or even Siri… The biggest advantage… No need to install apps. Just invite a bot into a conversation, text it, cc it or even give a voice-command in order to get things done.
The utility of invisible apps running in the background will be greatest as they help automate tasks. And, not when you tell them, but when they sense you’ll need them and pop up at your service. You won’t need to be technical to direct software to automate tasks — that’s the beauty of the messaging experience and how these apps will be designed and built. It’ll help computers connect to people in ways they do naturally.
Amir Shevat, Head of Developer Relations at Slack, wrote a post about this — “The Era of the Conversational Office.” It relates back to the previous predictions that messaging will drive conversations, and conversations will drive everything else. The conversational office means it’ll not only be easier to collaborate with remote workers (which has been drastically on the rise), but with software and computerized systems. Amir describes the importance and what this means for the future of work environment:
Why is this so exciting? Why is it so great that we converse with our systems? Why should a computer communicate with us through this chat-based user experience? The answer to that lays in the fact that most current systems provide a sucky (hard and unproductive) user interface. We hate our vacation system because it is hard to navigate, we shy away from our expense system because it is cumbersome, our CRM is a nightmare of checkboxes and data fields we do not understand, our bug and production system is a shrine that only the IT managers and developers can step into.
Spot on. Now everyone can interact with those systems in much more meaningful ways.
Let’s be honest… no one enjoys legacy LMS systems and being forced to sit through hour long powerpoint presentations for training. It’s the worst. People don’t learn that way anymore, let alone retain information. The future of learning is continuous and through bite size nuggets that can be consumed when there’s a few minutes to spare. In fact, 80% of learning on the job happens informally — that’s outside of LMS systems, training, and the like. People are continually searching for things online throughout the day. In many cases, these searches to fill knowledge gaps that they have at the moment. For engineers, it could be researching a new technology that they’re adopting.
Slack Bots will bring learning bots to your Slack command centre with invisible apps that can listen, learn, and recommend. (Check out Jeff Mcneill’s post on learning bots for human learning.) It would be the perfect delivery channel for bringing learning to a portal where your team actually spends their time. This would help solve one of the biggest problems with today’s learning systems. The Abhijit Bhaduri, the Chief Learning Officer of Wipro, describes this well in his post “Scaling up Learning”:
Formal opportunities to learn are always rationed and never timely enough simply because learning is never built in to any person’s daily routine.
If “People are the Next Big App”, then Slack Bots could be the missing links to connect appropriate learning experiences to continually keep ourselves “updated” and relevant in the workforce.
FYI… if you’re an engineer and like to share things on Slack, we’re building a Slack Bot for learning over at Outlearn. We’d love to get your feedback in the process. Shoot me an email if you’re interested alex [at] Outlearn.com
Thanks to Matt Schlicht I just discovered and joined a handful of public slack channels that essentially micro communities. His post “The Top 75 Slack Communities for Entrepreneurs & Developers” is an excellent place to start. There’s no doubt that this trend will continue. At Outlearn, we use private channels for on-boarding and to support customers. It’s pretty easy to see how these private channels could be used for micro communities, invite only groups, your top customers or advocates (Influitive might be fairly worried about this. Not sure why they don’t have an Advocacy Bot yet…). These channels could be the ultimate way to engage your advocates, reward them, and build relationships.
Perhaps the best part about these communities is how you can interact with people where you interact with your colleagues. You don’t have to adopt a new platform, create a new login somewhere, or remember to visit a site to continue a conversation. It’ll all happen right next to this window in my Slack app. Naturally, that reduces a lot of steps and increases my likelihood I’ll join in the conversation.
There’s nearly an App for everything on the iPhone… Now, for the coming era of the Bots. What apps did for the phone experience, Slack Bots will do for the work collaboration experience.
Welcome to the Bot Era. A world where invisible apps connect experiences between humans, computers, and artificial intelligence through natural language & communication.
Does your company have a Slack Bot? Reply in the comments with a quick pitch… perhaps we can make an equivalent of a Product Hunt, but for Bots — “Bot Hunt”… type a command for a problem you have and the bot will recommend an appropriate bot to help you.
Share some bot love & hit recommend if you enjoyed ;)
p.s. Slack, I love you.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is an elegant business model. Once you build the product, you can sell it to any number of customers. The only changes required are minor tweaks to the configuration. SaaS businesses work by charging a recurring fee. At each billing cycle, we need to re-earn the trust of our customers, creating a powerful alignment of interest between us and the customers we serve.  For customers, SaaS just works™. They don’t have to install anything, and paying a smaller recurring fee is a lot more palatable on the balance books. For us, SaaS has two benefits. First, having recurring revenue makes our finances predictable. Second, it cuts down development overhead, since new products can be rolled out simultaneously to all clients. To understand the SaaS business, let’s deconstruct the levers that control it.
Financially, the objective of a business is to increase profitability, where:
Profit = Revenue — Cost
There are two ways we can increase profitability. Either we increase revenue or decrease costs.
For a SaaS business, revenue can be modeled as:
Revenue = Number of customers * Revenue/Customer
or more completely,
Revenue = Number of customers * Number of product types * Price per product type * Number of seats/customer * Retention rate
To increase revenue, we control the following levers:
There are two ways to increase the number of product types we sell to customers:
The easiest way to grow revenue is to raise the price of each product line. As long as the market is willing to pay more, growing revenue by raising prices requires no development. In an ideal world, we have perfect price inelasticity, i.e. we can raise the price without losing any customers. That will only happen when our product offers unique value that no-one else can match. To figure out just how high we can price the product, we triangulate pricing for SaaS through a few strategies.
A non-exhaustive set of strategies to increase the number of seats:
Retention is a measure of the number of completed payment cycles. Customers churn when someone else does a significantly better job of delivering value. Competitors need to create such a compelling proposition that it persuades our customers to overcome inertia, training, and migration costs. To lose a customer means that we weren’t listening.  To ensure customers stay, SaaS businesses need a Customer Success (CS) team. The tactics used by CS to drive retention are:
The number of customers can be modeled as
Number of customers = Acquisitions * Conversion rate
The levers we have are either increasing the number of leads coming in through the gate, or increasing our success at converting them into paying customers. While the strategies for growing the number of customers is too broad a topic to cover here, we have marketing and sales organizations that are uniquely focused on this.
Key costs in a SaaS business can broadly be identified as:
The core thesis of a SaaS business is that the costs grow roughly linearly, whereas revenue grows exponentially. To see it in action, let’s create a very simple business model:
Where revenue is:
and cost is
While we start in the red, over a period of time we see incredibly attractive returns.
Plotting the cumulative values against each other, over time we get:
Understanding the levers at play empowers us to diagnose issues and drive outcomes. What levers have you found impactful in managing your SaaS business?

Top highlight
This post is about fear and uncertainty, how we respond to that uncertainty, and how we accidentally perpetuate learned helplessness in software development.
SaaS products are service touch-points. Customers don’t buy, they rent or pay-per-use. Adding features to the product cannot be equated to adding features to a physical product. The feature may be “shipped”, but more accurately you are establishing a potential value stream in a complex service ecosystem. To quote Dave Snowden, “software development needs to be seen as a service and as an ecology not as a manufacturing process.” Yet, the vestiges of manufacturing remain.
Complexity triggers our defense instincts.
We plan. We play planning poker. We estimate. We play “buy a feature” with our stakeholders. We try to calculate ROI (the cost and reward side). We draw linear process flows as circles and call them loops. We stoke the feature factory, crank the velocity, add bullet points to feature lists, and bask in a false sense of rigor. Output soothes the nerves, albeit temporarily.
As Snowden remarks, “going through a linear process in shorter cycles or drawing it as a circle does not make it non-linear”. Our challenge is nonlinear. Therefore, you’re battling a mismatch between the problem space and the approach. Manufactured Product = linear. Service = nonlinear, complex adaptive system.
Remarked a developer friend:
After all the ****ing song and dance with estimates, it is three months later and no one is using the damn thing. It was shipped and forgotten … on to the next feature right away. We were 1.2x of estimate, yet the ROI discussed is tracking at .2 … probably negative if you figure in the technical debt we were forced to add. We’ll lose money! But hey … we are “predictable”
The reality is that we are not great at predicting/understanding:
But, but, but, but …. we should still try, right?
It’s not worth it. Heavy business cases, ROI calculations, project estimates, feature estimates, complex prioritization schemes, etc. — all of that upfront stuff — is mostly useless. They reinforce a linear delivery model mindset and being able to predict the items above. We might progressively narrow in on an ROI estimate over time, but solving that puzzle upfront is nearly impossible.
Your best bet is to aim resources at a seemingly valuable problem to solve (or customer’s job-to-be-done), attempt to continuously deliver value, and hone your ability to “sense and respond” based on what happens. We may not be great at the points above, but we’re better when we actually observe a response (sense) and respond accordingly. Amplify and diminish/mute/kill accordingly.
But you need to be able to move quickly, deliver value continuously, learn and experiment, and fail safely. “Our team can’t do that!” you say. That’s a problem. When your ability to move and learn quickly is compromised, we are forced to maniacally protect our resources. We MUST become clairvoyants. We MUST try to do the impossible and look into our crystal balls and correctly predict the future of a complex adaptive system (hard/impossible). You can only do that when your horizon is very short, and you are moving quickly.
We then have a self-fulfilling prophecy … because we’re weak, we impose a way of working that discourages ever becoming good at our weakness! The feature Tetris / factory starts up, and your team never learns how to iterate and progressively add value to a value stream. Worst of all, teams become overly reliant on receiving a prescriptive idea/solution vs. aggressively tackling a problem to solve, failing, and learning.
And that’s where I’ll stop for the day. Are your planning and estimation efforts actually adding value? Do they “work” (outside of assuaging internal fears, and aligning everyone’s cognitive biases)? Are they really necessary? If you’re firing on all cylinders and doing all that stuff, well awesome! If not, is this a chicken and egg problem?

SaaSに代表されるようなB2B向けサービスを展開する上で、顧客セグメントの広げ方（いわゆる山の登り方）は資金の少ないスタートアップにとって、極論すると生死を分かつ程、大きな戦略判断になる。
その判断において、エンタープライズ(大企業)、それともSMB(中小企業)から山を登るか？は1つの顧客セグメントを切る軸として重要な判断軸となる。なぜなら、(超一般化すると)セールスサイクルや獲得コスト、プロダクトの難易度等において、エンタープライズとSMBは違う生き物だからだ。当然のことながら、狙う地域、市場の構造、競合プレイヤーの存在、プロダクト特性によって異なるが、大まかなこの2つの生き物の違いを理解した上で、戦略を考えることは非常に意義のあることだと考える。
そこで今回は、日本の市場全体、そして一般的なエンタープライズとSMBの違い、それにより発生するSaaSの”イノベーションのジレンマ”についてTomasz Tungus氏らの記事等をベースに考えたい。
まずは日本の市場構造の全体像をエンタープライズ(大企業)とSMB(中小企業)に分けて、さっとおさらいしよう。
まず企業数ベースで言うと、日本はSMBが99.7%を占め、特に小規模がそのほとんどを占める小企業大国であることはご案内の通りである。しかし、SaaSはアカウントベースでの月額課金であることを踏まえ、従業員数で見てみると、エンタープライズは全体の約30%、SMBの中でも中規模が約50%と市場の見え方が変わる。一方、どこかお金を持っているかを付加価値総額で見てみると、エンタープライズが大きなお財布を持っていることが判る。
まとめると、社数では小規模(SB)、従業員数では中規模(MB)、お財布の大きさではエンタープライズというのがざっくりとした日本の市場構造だ。
次にSaaSスタートアップの視点で見た時に、エンタープライズとSMBの一般的な違いについて、Tomasz Tunguz氏の記事をベースに以下に示す。
御覧頂いて判る通り、資金の少ない創業初期のスタートアップにとってSMBから登る方がいくつか有利な点がある。(以下)
1.初期の売上を立上げがしやすい SMBの方が意思決定が早く、セールスサイクルが短いので初期の売上を作りやすい
2. 顧客獲得コスト(CAC)が低いSMBの開拓において、顧客社数も多く、リーチしやすい。それに加えて、セールスチームに経験豊富な、単価の高いアカウント・エグゼクティブ的な営業マンは必要ない
3. 必要最小限のプロダクト(MVP)を早く作りやすいセールスサイクルが早いので、プロダクト開発へのフィードバックももらいやすい。その上、初期の売上をプロダクト開発の重要な資金源にすることができる
4. 資本効率が良く、少額の資金で進められる1–3に関わることだが、早期にエコノミクスが回しやすく、少額の資金で進めやすい
そのため、Salesforce.com、Hubspot、Box、Zendesk、DocuSign等、数多くの成功したSaaS企業はSMBから入り、その後エンタープライズ向けに拡大する”Up marketアプローチ”を取るケースが多い。(但し、領域や時勢によって例外も多数あることは忘れてはならない。HR TechのWorkDay等は初めからエンタープライズ主体で拡大したが、ドットコムバブルの時代で資金調達環境が良かったためだと考えられる。)
エンタープライズとSMBでは必要な営業体制にも違いがあることは上記でも触れたが、これについてPacific Crestが行っている世界336社が参加しているSaaS企業の統計から説明したい。
契約額サイズの小さいSMBの場合はインサイドセールスやネットでの販売を担当するマーケティングが主体に、エンタープライズの場合、手厚いアカウント直の営業が一般的な違いだ。契約サイズと企業規模は1対1には結びつかないので、粗い議論だが、大まかな求められる体制の違いは理解頂けると思う。
SMBから登った場合、SaaS企業が成長をする途中で陥りやすいワナが存在する。それがいわゆる”SaaSのイノベーションのジレンマ”だ。
イノベーションのジレンマは、1997年にHBSのクレイトン・クリステンセン教授が提唱した理論で、本来的には「大企業は新しい小さな市場には魅力を感じず、既存プロダクトの価値や事業体制とカニバリ/相反が起こるため、イノベーションが起こせなくなる現象」を指す。(ここでは、スタートアップが新しい・小さな市場から、古い・大きな市場に行く際の文脈で使わせて頂く。)
この”SaaSのイノベーションのジレンマ”がいかに起こるのか、をお馴染みのSカーブを見ながら簡単に説明する。
・初期はSMBを獲得することで売上成長、プロダクトの磨き込みにより、次の資金調達ができるようになる(A)
・しかし、SMBで拡大していくと、時間が経つにつれSMB特有の高いチャーン(3–7%)が売上成長を上回り、成長が寝てくる(B)
・そこで単価の高く、チャーンの低いエンタープライズに対して、SMB向けに作り込まれたプロダクト、営業体制/アプローチで闘い上手くいかず、売上成長が止まる(つまりB→Cに行けない)
そこで、SMB→エンタープライズの登り方でSaaSのイノベーションのジレンマを回避し、Sカーブに上手く乗るにはA→Bの段階で以下の3つを事前に理解しておく必要があると考える。
1.SMBでの成長の先にはイノベーションのジレンマがあること
2. エンタープライズ向けのプロダクト要件と体制の違い
3. エンタープライズ向けのセールス要件と体制の違い
ちなみにこのSaaSのイノベーションのジレンマを、3のセールス体制を工夫することで乗り越えた事例としてJIRA等のディベロッパーツールで知られるAtlassian社のケースが面白いので紹介させて頂く。
従来のやり方(左)では、SMBに合わせてプロダクト開発、マーケティングでの量の獲得をした後で、チャーンコントロールと継続的な売上成長のために、エンタープライズ専門のアウトバウンド営業チームを作る。
一方で、Atlassian社のFlywheel SaaSモデルでは全く異なるアプローチをとっている。エンタープライズ専門のチームはインバウンド主体で、upsell/cross sell専門で行い、中堅も同様である。アウトバウンドで新規リードを取ることが唯一許されているのが、SMBのマーケティングチームのみであり、いわゆるハンター/ファーマーが従来と逆転させている。
このモデルにしている理由は、大きく3つあると考えられる。1つ目は、Atlassianのプロダクトがエンジニアやプロダクトマネージャーのように直営業を嫌い、リーチしにくく、顧客獲得コストが高いユーザー向けであることが大きな要因だ。2つ目は、開発者向けツールのような個人ユースからチーム、組織へと拡大ができる、つまりSMB→エンタープライズに自然と広がれるプロダクトであることだ。3つ目は、直営業をガンガン掛けるような競合プレイヤーがおらず、営業勝負の市場で無かったことだと考える。これにより、Atlassian社は以下のように急成長を遂げ、2014年当時で年率44%成長を達成した。
これまで語ったように、SMBからエンタープライズへの顧客セグメントの拡大に枚挙に暇がないが、あくまでも超一般論として理解してほしい。市場や競合、プロダクトの特性によって、いくらでも例外があるので、サービスの拡大戦略を考える参考にして頂ければ幸いに思う。

There are plenty of elaborate financial model templates out there, but the ones I’ve seen come with a key problem — it’s a significant undertaking to update them.
In fact, inaccurate financial modeling and the hassle to update that model is what nearly put Baremetrics out of business last year before we worked with them to get a sustainable model in place.
In this blog post, we are going to walk through a SaaS financial model that can be quickly updated by using exports from Quickbooks and Baremetrics. This should help founders and CEOs of companies with up to $500,000 in ARR* get:
The model will take a couple of hours to set up, but the monthly updates should take just 20-30 minutes. Everything in the model is modular, so whenever you grow to a point of needing more customized forecasts, you or your future CFO can expand on the area you find lacking.
*Companies nearing $1MM ARR typically have a model that’s at least somewhat customized for their business. If you don’t, I’d like to know how you pull it off.
Before you do anything else, you’ll want to download the Excel file so you can follow along.
You can also view and use a Google Sheets version! Just make a copy of it and save it to your own Google Drive.
In this section, we look at pulling exports from Quickbooks and Baremetrics to your financial model. The goal is that you can use the same exports each month with minimal changes, allowing you to focus on forecasts and actually building your business.
Before you start, make sure your bookkeeping separates cost of sales and expenses, enabling you to calculate a gross profit. If you aren’t doing this, you should probably get started. You need to understand your gross margins in order to figure out if your business will ever become sustainable.
First, pull up your Profit and Loss report for the current year, separated by month. In the examples below, I’m using Quickbooks Online, but you should be able to use an accounting software of your choice.
Next, copy and paste the export into the Profit and Loss Export worksheet of your financial model. Make sure to paint the area from above the Income all the way to the last month’s Net Income. Make sure to delete any rows that are left in from the example model.
Lastly, fill in the Historicals Start Date and Forecast Start Date in the Controls worksheet. The first is most likely January 1, and the latter the 1st of the current month. Add your current cash balance as well.
Next, we need data about your customers. The easiest way to do this is to pull a handful of quick reports from Baremetrics, but you can also enter these in manually.
Get started by heading over to Monthly Recurring Revenue in your Baremetrics dashboard. From the dropdown, select the time period for your historicals you specified above. For example, Jan 1 — Mar 31. Change the chart dropdown to display “Months”, and use the “Download Breakout” button to pull the first export.
Repeat the same for the following reports.
Once you have all the forecasts, drop in the MRR export to MRR Export worksheet and Forecasts to Forecast Export worksheet. Please note that Customer Export worksheet includes four exports — Active Customers Breakout, Upgrades, Downgrades, and the Active Customers Graph. I’ve separated these by a border line for clarity.
Now that you have exported the data, you’ll need to tell the model how to pull it from the export going forward.
There are five major sections inside your Profit and Loss export: Income, Cost of Goods Sold, Expenses, Other Income and Other Expenses. You’ll need to copy and paste these categories — without the actual numbers or the totals — to the operating model.
Start by painting the category and all its’ subcategories, and paste it to the Operating Model in the same section. I usually like to use “Paste Values” to preserve formatting.
Repeat for each category, and pay extra attention not to include any line item with a “Total” in front of it, otherwise you end up counting the expense twice.
For the Baremetrics export, we have already told the model what belongs where by pasting everything using the pre-set format available in the csv export.
Next, move to the Payroll Model worksheet and add each of your employees with their role, annual salary, benefits, and whether they are an employee or a contractor. Also, add start dates and end dates if they are in the future. While roles currently include Support, Sales, Founder, and Engineering, you can certainly add more if needed.
Map each role and contractor back to the Operating Model from the dropdown below. Doing this tells the model which of the Profit and Loss line-items each payroll category goes to.
The dropdown gets a little clunky, but you should find each of your Profit and Loss Categories to choose from. Note that you can “push” multiple roles and Compensation Components to the same line item.
Lastly, scroll to the bottom of the payroll page to make sure the assumptions are to your liking.
At last, we can begin forecasting. Go to the Operating model, and start selecting the type of forecast you’re going to do for each line item from the “Input Type” column. The purpose of this is to tell the model if it should pull a forecast from another worksheet, use previous month’s figures, or do something else.
Currently, there are two input types pulling from another worksheet — Revenue Model and Payroll Model. Start by changing your primary revenue line-item’s type to Revenue Model, followed by changing each payroll category to Payroll Model. The first is probably something along the lines of Subscription Revenue, and the latter categories you got familiar with already when mapping out your payroll categories.
Note: If the revenue seems all messed up or results in errors, skip to the Revenue Model section and come back here once finished. Unless you know what you’re doing, make sure to select only one Revenue Model as an Input Type.
For line-items other than revenue and payroll, I’ve included pre-fills for % of Sales, and Continue Last Month. The first one is useful for forecasting something not quite as demanding that requires a separate worksheet, but that still scales up with your revenue. Hosting costs are a good example. Continuing last month’s figure is a good idea when forecasting something simple and static such as near-term rent.
You can — and probably should — add some custom forecasting as well. I prefer to color code these with blue text and blue background, to clearly point out that there’s a forecast that’s not pulling from a model or a prefill.
As David Skok points out in his SaaS 2.0 Metrics — the “Bible” — there are three things that really matter when running a SaaS business:
Let’s start with #1 — new customers.
In the Revenue Model worksheet, we’re pulling your historical number of new customers and new revenue from the Baremetrics Revenue Export. This gives us the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for each month of historicals, which we can then use as a driver in our future forecasts. Another driver is naturally the number of new customers.
I like to start by filling in something flat but realistic, and come back to fine-tune things once everything is built out and done. Your Baremetrics exports pre-fills your historical data, which should give you enough context to get started.
Next, let’s continue with #2 — the dreaded churn. As you can see, the formula I’m using for forecasting churn is slightly different. Even though we still pull the number of churned customers and dollars churned, we calculate both churn ARPU and churn %. Now, you could use the actual number of customers churned for your forecasts, but I’ve opted to use a %-based approach as it’s more common.
Lastly, repeat this with #3 — Monetizing your customers, or expansion revenue.
Next, take a quick look at the line “Recurring Revenue, Monthly Only.” Here you should see your forecasts, along with your existing monthly revenue, courtesy of your Baremetrics export.
If your customers are mostly monthly subscribers, that’s it! Your first pass of revenue forecast is done. If you have completed the previous section on mapping your revenue line-item to the Revenue Model, your revenue will be automatically flowing into the rest of the model.
Now, it’s worth repeating that the above model works only if your customers are mostly monthly recurring customers. If the majority of your customers are annual customers, you should build a near-copy of the above revenue model, where the revenue is recurring annually instead of monthly.
However, if you are like many early-stage SaaS companies I’ve seen, you have some annual clients but not enough to forecast with any degree of accuracy. In this case, I often like to include renewals from existing annual plans, and ignore any new annual additions altogether. Excluding all annual plans would ultimately understate your cash forecasts, as you would constantly bring in more than your forecast.
Monthly renewals for your annual plans are automatically pulled from the Baremetrics Forecast Export — all you need to do is to discount it with your best guess for annual churn. (After all, at this stage you probably won’t have an accurate picture of what the actual annual % churn would look like).
This results in your company’s revenue forecast!
At this point, it’s time to take a step back. Most founders we work with prefer to start their monthly review by looking at the big picture on the Dashboard worksheet, before diving deeper into individual forecast models and major expenses.
By now, you have a good understanding how the model works, so you can start to play with the assumptions and see how the effect on your business going forward. Use the table below in the Dashboard worksheet to create differing scenarios. Unless you modified the revenue model inputs in the previous section of the post, this table will pre-fill the input arrays for you.
The Base-Case column uses your last month’s figures, and you can start to insert numbers better than these for the Optimistic scenario, and worse for the Fallback / Pessimistic scenario. Typically, you’d want to plan for
Once done, you can start to play with the “Scenario” dropdown to see the effects of your changes.
The resulting dashboard gives you a high level visibility to your business. You need to know what your revenues are vs. total cash outflow (which here I call Gross Burn), as well as how your runway looks in the coming months.
Given that we’re still working with drivers that don’t change over time, you might want to improve the accuracy of the model after a month or two of tracking results. At that point, go inside the Revenue Model worksheet, and start inserting the following formula to any forecast arrays:
Syntax: =CHOOSE(Scenario, Optimistic, Base-Case, Fallback) Example for new monthly customers, April: =Choose(Scenario, Previous Month + 5, Previous Month + 2, Previous Month +1)Example for Churn %, April: =Choose(Scenario, 3%, 4%, 6%)
If you end up using the array-based forecasting, use the dashboard real estate as a section of “What We Need to Believe?” In other words, instead of pre-filling your array results here, pull here averages and trends for your forecasts. For example, “Churn starts at 4% a month and declines to 2.5% by the end of the year.”
If you got this far, you don’t need convincing that the ability to glimpse into the future is a must for every growing business. It’s likely that none of your forecasts are 100% accurate — in fact, some of them won’t even be close — but you need a financial model to better understand which scenario you’re trending towards.
My goal is that the model we just built enables you to look at the most up-to-date plan to help you with your next steps forward as a company.
If you’re interested in having some work with your company to build a custom financial model and help you update it regularly, we’d love to hear from you at Flightpath!

“Which are some of the SaaS startups in India?” — Many of us must have asked this question in various forums and communities. The data is scattered all over and there are several hundreds of SaaS startups in the country.
When I was part of the team at Pipemonk (now acquired by Freshdesk), we decided to make an attempt to collate the data. I hope this helps a bunch of potential startup talent, investors, marketers and the Indian SaaS community in general.

Today we are announcing the closing of our two latest funds — Craft Ventures III ($612 million) and Craft Ventures Growth I ($510 million) — for a combined $1.12 billion. This brings our total assets under management to $2 billion. Combining our new growth fund with our flagship venture strategy gives us the ability to invest in the most exciting companies across both early and growth stages.
Over the last four years at Craft and prior to that as angel investors, we have backed over 30 unicorn companies at an early stage. Through our first two funds, we have had the privilege of partnering with dozens of visionary founders at their Series A or Series B round, and invested in many more at the seed stage. Some of the unicorns in Fund I and Fund II include Addepar, Bird, Bitgo, ClickUp, Multicoin, Neuralink, Pipe, Reddit, Sourcegraph, and SpaceX — and many more are on their way.
While Craft has invested in market-defining companies across many categories, we have a special focus on two areas where we have unique expertise:
SaaS businesses are attractive for their predictable, compounding recurring revenue. Moreover in our view, Bottom-Up SaaS companies, which have the ability to spread virally like a consumer product, are some of the most attractive opportunities because of their growth potential. At Craft, this practice area is led by David Sacks, who pioneered the “consumerization of the enterprise” as founder and CEO of Yammer, where he adapted growth tactics previously learned as founding COO of PayPal. SaaS companies in Craft’s portfolio include Addepar, AgentSync, ClickUp, OpenPhone, Scratchpad, Sendoso, Sourcegraph, and Vendr.
Marketplace businesses are attractive for their strong network effects, liquidity-driven flywheels, and deep moats for defensibility. At Craft, this practice area is led by Jeff Fluhr, who created the playbook for vertical marketplaces as the founder and CEO of StubHub. The hyper-verticalization of marketplaces is now in full force, and Craft has invested in some amazing companies as part of this thesis, including Instawork, Seated, Shef, Snackpass, and Trusted.
In a time when capital is abundant, our real value is advice and support. Every member of the Craft team has either been a unicorn founder or a successful operator. This deep industry expertise means that everyone at Craft is equipped to provide input or serve as a sounding board when founders need it most.
For Fund III, Craft has doubled the size of our team of Operating Partners, seasoned former executives who can provide mentorship and advice to founders. This team helps our companies grow and navigate obstacles along the way. Areas of expertise include:
We are also delighted to announce four new partners on our investment team:
With the expansion of our team and the closing of our third venture fund and first growth fund, Craft is poised to double down on our mission to partner with the most promising early-stage and growth-stage software founders. We look forward to continuing our focus in areas we know well — SaaS and Marketplaces — and dedicating even more resources to help support the next generation of iconic companies.

Hi there, we’re Point Nine Capital a VC firm focused on SaaS and marketplaces. If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
A couple of years ago the “prosumer” model was really hot among SaaS investors. Prosumers ( professional + consumer) are individuals who buy “professional software” either for their use or their activity as freelancers / solopreneurs. Regarding customer segmentation you end up with:
The prosumer segment is very attractive due to its market size with tens of millions of potential customers. If you manage to capture only a fraction of them paying 5$ — 10$ per month you can build a significant business. Another advantage of this model is the “land and expand” strategy a.k.a employees bring their own software within their company which is “forced” to buy a pro version after a while.
If on paper this model looks very attractive the challenges which come with it quickly became obvious.
Scaling prosumer acquisition is insanely hard. The problem with the prosumer segment is that it has a high churn and a low account revenue expansion potential — prosumers cannot pay much more than a few tens of dollars monthly. As a consequence to scale revenue, you need to continuously increase your top of funnel lead generation without increasing your customer acquisition costs which is almost impossible without a viral product.
The land and expand strategy is insanely hard too. It also became increasingly clear that the “landing” part was doable, but the “expanding” part was a real challenge for pure prosumer products. Businesses need specific features, and very often the gap between a product which appeals to prosumers and its “business compatible” version is huge. Trying to bridge this gap killed many startups.
Many founders and VCs learned these lessons the hard way, and today the pure “prosumer” SaaS model is probably not as attractive as it used to be — in a VC compatible perspective at least.
However the trend I noticed the past couple of years is that the prosumer segment is increasingly served not by pure SaaS players but by B2C / C2C players who are offering extra “prosumer” features to their consumer base:
All the companies cited above are “consumer” companies first (whether B2C or C2C or social).

Decisions regarding pricing are of crucial importance for SaaS businesses. The first decision point usually relates to whether you are contemplating a Freemium offering or choosing to charge from the off. The pro’s and con’s of launching with a Freemium offering are well documented but regardless this decision warrants some thought. Additional areas to consider include:
1/ The number of price tiers you plan to offer
2/ Which currency you plan to anchor in
3/ Whether you plan to dynamically price around the world (changing currency based on IP address)
4/ The indicative price ranges you plan to launch at.
As you evaluate the above, the following list represents some of the key things to consider when evaluating the pricing strategy for your SaaS startup.
In terms of SaaS startup decisions, pricing is a critically important consideration but an area that does not always get the attention it deserves. The good news is that decisions on pricing are largely reversible ones meaning entrepreneurs can test their pricing without much downside.
Pricing decisions inform much more than just the ‘price’, as it impacts everything from the ‘approach to sales’ to the very viability of the ‘business model’. For example a low monthly price point must be aligned with a self service ‘zero touch’ model whereas a high price point will likely need a ‘field sales’ based approach to the market.
(Understanding SaaS: Why the Pundits have it Wrong by Scott Kupor and Preethi Kasireddy)
2. Think in Terms of a Pricing Range
It is useful to think of pricing in the context of prospects across a continuum from hunting ‘elephants’ (a small number of huge customers) to targeting ‘fleas’ (a large numbers of small/ free customers).
Entrepreneurs need to be really clear as to where the realizable value for prospects lies when viewed in the context of $1/ $10/$100/ $1000/ $10000 a month pricing. Are there substitute offerings or analogs you can use as reference points? How big is the pain your solution seeks to address?
Once you are clear where you fit you can then assess the resultant implications of the price range in terms of the marketing strategy (including budgets) as well as the preferred lead generation approach i.e. content led versus outbound led.
You can also use the indicative range to align with your investment requirements, the cost of customer acquisition (CAC), the sales complexity and what this means in terms of your approach to sales (self service versus field sales). Knowing whether you are hunting elephants or fleas is of paramount importance in terms of how you allocate your resources.
(Five ways to Build a $500m business by Christopher Janz)
3. Align Pricing with the Business Model
It is also useful to think about the differences between ‘Freemium’, Low Touch, Inside Sales, Field Sales, and how these different approaches need to align with the proposed price points and sales complexity so as to help you avoid the ‘Startup Graveyard’ so aptly described by Joel York. For example, If you need to demo your application face to face, the cost of acquisition will likely be significant and your price range will need to reflect this. Whether your offering is primarily a B2B or a B2C one will also impact your decision here.
SaaS businesses are particularly tough on cashflows, as marketing costs occur up front, and (uncertain) revenues are generated into the future. For innovative startups the Life Time Value (LTV) is practically impossible to calculate at the start up stage and costs need to be managed very carefully so as to ensure the business stays afloat.
Startups lack historical data on which to base future revenue projections accurately so while costs are largely knowable, the Life Time Value is difficult to calculate accurately for early stage businesses.
However, once traction is achieved, and the business matures, SaaS businesses can generate strong ongoing cashflows with negligible associated costs. Hence the appeal of SaaS businesses! The key is to get your business to that point. If there is even the slightest disconnect between the price point and the product complexity you could be in big trouble.
(Three SaaS Sales Models by Joel York)
4. Seek Out Analogs
It is vitally important to learn from the experiences of others within your wider competitive space, particularly those further along their journey and those offering ‘broadly similar’ or substitute offerings. Pricing needs to also reflect the competitive set to ensure you are not pricing yourself out of the market.
Anchoring your pricing at a similar range to more established SaaS businesses who may offer broadly similar solutions also makes sense e.g. at Xpenditure we looked to ensure our pricing aligned well with other B2B productivity solutions within the expense management space.
“If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants” Isaac Newton
(Getting to Plan B by John Mullins)
5. Use Real Data to Inform Decisions
Pricing in a vacuum is hard, and the old ‘cost plus’ methods hold no weight in SaaS. Pricing needs to be more closely aligned with customer value (which can vary greatly by segment).
By a/b testing different pricing pages it is possible to use data to help inform decisions. Lacking traffic? Buy some PPC adverts and direct eyeballs at two different Unbounce landing pages and measure the results.
“Given the dynamic pricing environment, the most effective way I’ve found to pursue the right pricing is to test constantly and then compare different prices’ effectiveness at maximizing customer lifetime value. This is the process I’ve been using to benchmark different price points.” Tom Tungz
If you do decide to raise prices based on new data, it is best to ‘grandfather’ existing customers when increasing prices (retaining existing/ older and more loyal customers on the older prices) and not charging them the higher price.
(How to Determine which Price is Best for your SaaS Startup’s Product by Tom Tunguz)
6. Focus on Optimizing the Pricing Page
Entrepreneurs also need to consider versioning from the get go, and need to reflect on how different versions are needed as the product matured.
Decisions regarding what feature(s) to ‘version on’ (price discriminate) can be complicated and can result in cash being left on the table. ‘On page’ psychology on pricing pages has become increasingly important, as companies look to signpost products to different segments and to nudge prospects towards taking the first step.
The views on naming conventions have also evolved. It is very much a case of ‘Out with Premium and Basic’ and ‘In with Enterprise, SMB, Freelancer’ etc helping the various segments self select based on their needs as well as their group.
Derisking the decision for time pressed prospects is also of crucial importance, which explains the increase in ‘no credit card required’ sign ups as well as the placement of testimonials, and customer validations as forms of social proof (usually including well known logos) at the point of purchase.
(Hooked by Nir Eyal)
7. Obsess on Key SaaS Metrics
Entrepreneurs must also ensure adequate tracking is in place to ensure they are not funnelling prospects into ‘leaky buckets’ (applications that fail to retain users). Startups needed to ensure retention by delivering early value and applications like Intercom can help SaaS companies pre-empt churn based on data related to in-app behaviours.
Onboarding needs to be ‘frictionless’ and product managers need to ensure the ‘blank slate’ problem is adequately dealt with so new users are not left feeling underwhelmed by the application. (The blank slate is essentially the empty natural state of an app without any data in it).
(Backstage: Designing the New Blank Slate for Basecamp by Jason Fried)
8. Increase Prices as the Product Matures
It is also important to ensure pricing strategies are evaluated regularly. As the feature set matures, and segments emerge where the value being obtained is now disproportionate to the price, having the confidence to increase it is paramount. Pushing bug fixes, feature releases and enhancements on a regular basis quickly mount up in terms of delivering additional value. Ensuring heavy users pay a premium is only fair (driving average revenue per user is a key component of growth). The decisions you will have made about versioning and what you are metering on will be vital here.
Finally, entrepreneurs need to be aware of ‘cohort analysis’ and the importance of assessing customer data based on their cohort (typically those who subscribed at the same time as them). One would hope that over time that cohorts become more sticky, as an improved feature set delivers better value to the different emergent segments, than those early adopters who signed up for version 1 barely out of beta.
(What I Learned from Increasing my Prices by Ruben Gamez)
9. Know your Customer Segments
Like all businesses, ‘knowing your customer’ is critical for SaaS businesses. The world is your market and customers can be based anywhere.
Even simple signals on a pricing page like ensuring currencies reflect the currency of the ‘majority of customers’ is crucial (particularly for US prospects given the market size and appetite for SaaS applications). British companies like Geckoboard price in $ for this very reason (others use IP detect software to change prices based on IP location).
It is also important to recognize the challenges of a ‘Freemium led’ approach so as to ensure you don’t fall into the trap many others have fallen into where whole swathes of users are perfectly content with the Free and have no intention of upgrading (e.g. Spotify, Evernote, Trello etc). If these same free users require support of any kind - it could signal the death knell of your business.
Using personas to develop segmented offerings also helps to ensure that your marketing efforts indicate a strong awareness of their unique requirements will also help.
10. Track Core KPI’s and Metrics
SaaS business are really all about ‘the numbers’. Ensuring the team are au fait with everything from Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) to Churn Rates to Life Time Values ensures that there is full clarity re the performance of the business and where it needs to get to.
SaaS applications offer tremendous value to customers and entrepreneurs alike. But with most cancellations a mere click away, attention to detail is everything. By focusing on building a compelling proposition, that delivers real value to users on an ongoing basis (ensuring stickiness) will help ensure your SaaS startup thrives.
In summary, while focusing on customer acquisition and lead generation often represent the primary focus of sales and marketing teams at many startups, spending more time on your pricing strategy can have a disproportionate impact on your bottom line.

About two months ago I spent some time digging into data on SaaS financing rounds in the last ten years. If you’re interested in how SaaS funding has developed in the last decade, give it a read.
As I’ve mentioned in the post, the analysis was based on Crunchbase data, and I was somewhat uncertain about the quality of that dataset. Meanwhile, we got ourselves a PitchBook subscription, arguably one of the best data sources for private equity and VC financing data, which gave me an opportunity to try to validate the analysis using another, independent dataset. I was a bit worried that the results might look very different, in which case my attempt of “Trying to make sense of 10 years worth of SaaS funding data” would have led me to publish non-sense.
As you’ll see below, though, you’ll see that, fortunately, the data from both sources paints a fairly similar picture. There are definitely some differences, but in most cases, the Crunchbase data and the PitchBook data show the same trend, and it’s just the amplitude that’s different. The latter isn’t surprising: As I wrote in the original post, there are a lot of SaaS companies that don’t have the “SaaS” tag in Crunchbase, which is why I’ve extended the filter to “Software”, “Enterprise Software”, and “Cloud Computing”, with the side effect of casting the net a little too wide.
To compare the two data sources, I’ve created a number of charts that show the data from Crunchbase and PitchBook side-by-side. As you can see, I broke the data down by stage (Seed to Series D), geography (worldwide, and North America plus Europe), number of deals, and $ amounts invested. Have a look:

Great products are the lifeblood of every tech company, whether young or mature. Within the current SaaS landscape — especially regarding self-service and transactional sales models where switching costs tend to be lower and differentiation is more difficult — the role of Product Managers cannot be emphasized enough. They are the key figures to ensure that the company is creating something customers want and execute the product roadmap to stay ahead of the curve, focusing on long-term success. I’m personally excited to see the role of Product Managers continuously evolve. Here are seven reasons why I think this role is more important than ever:
You can’t just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they’ll want something new. (Steve Jobs)
Building relationships with your customers early on is key to success. As Steve Jobs summarizes, it is essential to follow your customers and even think ahead of their needs. In that perspective, it is important to have in mind that markets as well as customer needs change over time, in today’s environment probably faster than ever before. Maybe your customers would like to use voice as their primary input in the future? Part of a Product Manager’s job is to find this out.
It is well known that the first experience with your product matters a lot. A great onboarding to hook (trial) customer increases the chance to create this wow moment. What might be “Always be closing” in Sales, might be “Never Stop Onboarding” in Product Management.
On an ongoing basis, Google’s HEART Framework is a great help for Product Managers and Designers to measure different user-centric metrics and focus on customers. There are probably not many other employees in the company that understand your customers as well as the Product Managers.
One of the current trends I’m observing are shared product roadmaps where companies are publishing the features they’re working on, ideas they have and the history of implemented features. In addition, customers can submit ideas and engage on the product roadmap in form of likes or comments. Here is a good example from Front (a company we ’are an investor in). And of course, why shouldn’t you involve your customers? This shows how much you care about them and widens the idea funnel.
Having a 10x better product in terms of user experience and workflow can be seen as a clear USP compared to your competition. This is in particular true if you have some incumbents in this market and you are (one of) the first player with a fresh approach and new design.
The probability that you refer a product that blew you away from day one is relatively high. This behavior can start a viral loop. At Point Nine, we’re getting super excited when we see viral product expansion within and across companies. It is this kind of viral loop that can help companies grow very quickly without any or little marketing spend (land and expand strategy). In the absence of a great user experience, I am skeptical this is possible.
On the other side, in a market where you have fierce competition, e.g in HR for Applicant Tracking Systems, it can be very difficult to stand out if you only have a 2x or 3x better product. Here the role of the Product Manager is to clearly differentiate your product from the rest, to come up with a new approach and to think differently. If it is only about who is making the features of the incumbents nicer, it is hard to create a $100M business. I am not saying it is impossible but there is a lot you have to make right.
One example in another market is Asana. There are a ton of task management solutions out there but Asana was able to create a 10x better product for small teams than anybody else in the market. According to Asana’s Product Manager Sam Goertler this was mainly because they crafted a carefully chosen feature set and focused to solve a problem instead of simply trying to create a solution, especially during their redesign.
As consumers, we are used to a seamless user experience from all the great apps we are using and have increasingly high standards for new apps and products. These high expectations are shifting more and more into the B2B software market. We — especially the digital natives among us — want to use software and products in our office in the same way as we’re using Snapchat, Netflix or Amazon.
This is even more important for low-touch SaaS companies where users do not want to put in a huge amount of time to learn about how to use your product or new workflows. In today’s environment, if you don’t build your product using the latest models, it will be difficult to drive the formation of sticky user habits. If users have to change their digital habits, they are unlikely to convert to long-time customers. It is fine to have some customer churn as long as you have a big enough group of customers who loves your product and who is regularly engaged with it. Offer simple logins via Google, a great onboarding experience and easy integration into other tools for seamless workflows.
An interesting chart to take a look at the product usage is the Fogg Behavior Model that shows the three elements — 1) Value Proposition, 2) Interface and 3) Engagement — for a behavior to occur. Simply put, you can have high engagement with a confusing interface as long as you have a strong value proposition, e.g. solving a really complex problem. However, you cannot expect high user engagement with a confusing interface for a relatively weak value proposition. This is exactly why Product Managers are so indispensable.
To better understand user engagement, we are also reading product feedback on Product Hunt, the AppStore, Reddit or even Google Chrome Store for an extension. This often tells us a lot about your traction even before looking at the metrics. Sometimes, I am really impressed by the love some companies receive :-)
This little app […] made me change my whole web workspace to Chrome! Not an insignificant feat. I think the word badass comes to mind.
Customers value authentic brands because they ensure trust, create connotation and possibly establish strong relationships that lead to stronger customer lock-in. You do not have to copy Apple’s communication strategy for example, people value integrity of brands and in return this let’s you stand out.
Branding in general is a powerful tool for communication and storytelling. It is also possible to make a B2B brand emotional. Building such a brand in B2B is incredibly difficult, yet not impossible. Some great B2B SaaS brands that have evolved in recent times including Salesforce, Slack, Mailchimp or Intercom for example. The role of the Product Manager is also to build and integrate that brand into the product and culture.
Brand is really the connection between you and your customers. If you have a very strong culture, then the brand will come through. (Brian Chesky)
Yes, I mention Slack several times in this post but they have done a fantastic job in doing so with their playful and fun to use approach — just think about the Slackbot. Andrew Wilkinson has written a great post about that and Sandwich Video produced a nice little intro video in the early times:
The latest Design in Tech report from KPCB indicates that more than one third (36%) of the Top25 funded startups are co-founded by designers. More importantly, this number is up from 20% in 2015. Some good examples include Hootsuite’s Ryan Holmes or Slack’s CEO Stewart Butterfield who held several design positions in his career.
It is in the DNA of these companies to always think about the customers and how each new feature will impact them. They are shaping the product and design early on and are often obsessed with a customer centric view which they often implement into the company culture. Usually, they are the ones among the founding team who is owning the product at the beginning. However, over time the time founders put in shaping the product usually decreases as the company scales. Therefore, it is mission-critical to hire great Product Managers who overtake the work those founders did at the beginning.
Notably, the same is true for B2C companies and if you take a look at the most valued tech companies, you see a lot of co-founders with a design background — be it Brian Chesky from Airbnb or Evan Spiegel from Snapchat who studied Product Design in Stanford. Some people even argue that Evan and his brilliant understanding about product and users is the only but most crucial part, Facebook cannot copy from Snapchat.
In that perspective, Slack is even more interesting since they are an enterprise company but act like a consumer company, blurring the boundaries between B2B and B2C. Why are they doing this you might ask? One of the reasons is that Developers have become powerful decision makers within buying centers, especially for developer tools (obviously). So you should try to find those product champions within a company to sell into enterprise organizations and grow from there.
Software often follows cycles. Over time companies can benefit from the latest technology and might be able to build the same product and features in a shorter period of time compared to previous companies. This can be seen in the graphic below where the youngest company, C, is able to be the product leader in a shorter amount of time compared the previous two companies A and B.
How can you prevent this? There is probably no secret sauce but a good way to tackle this — besides always staying paranoid — is analyzing and iterating quickly. Have clearly defined metrics, learn from the data and optimize them. In most of the cases it is not about who can build the most features but who is able to build the best thought-through product.
As a Product Manager, you are responsible for a lot of different goals that contribute to the company’s overall success, Josh Elman has also written a great piece about Product Managers and their influence.
It starts from understanding and executing on the company’s vision to maintain the product roadmap while always learning more about your customers and market. You are also working in the intersection between the engineering and business side, trying to fulfill unrealistic expectations :-)
A great product manager has the brain of an engineer, the heart of a designer, and the speech of a diplomat. (Deep Nishar, VP Product LinkedIn)
In this role it is not only about holding the different pieces together but also how to adopt new technologies that can add value such as Machine Learning — not for the sake of it but to really solve a problem or improve the customer experience. To sum this up, Product Managers fulfill a lot of different roles and I think this underlines the influence they have on the customers as well as on the company and its vision and its future.
Please let me know if you have any further thoughts or comments.
P. S. In Berlin there is quite a vivid product management community with several Meetups on a regular basis: On Product, Product Heroes, Product Tank. Hope to see you there!

As the year is coming to an end I’d like to share a few thoughts on what we’ll be looking for in the SaaS world in 2017. This is not meant to be an exhaustive enumeration but rather a brief outline of a few big themes that I feel particularly strongly about.
In the last couple of years I’ve come to the opinion that in order to build a SaaS unicorn you need to have either (a) a highly viral customer acquisition engine or (b) significant negative net churn (that is, a dollar retention rate significantly above 100%). The rationale behind this statement, which might seem odd at first sight, is actually simple math. If you don’t have negative net churn you’re losing an increasing amount of MRR every month to churn, simply because your churn rate is applied to an ever-increasing base. That means that as long as you have positive net churn, you’ll have to add an increasing amount of new MRR from new customers every month just to offset churn. As you’re getting bigger and bigger it will become extremely difficult to maintain a high growth rate if you have to replace an ever-increasing amount of churn — unless you have an inherently viral product.
At a somewhat theoretical level, what I’m saying is that since net churn MRR grows as a function of your MRR base, you better have a mechanism that lets you add new MRR as a function of your existing base as well. I know this is a somewhat simplified way of looking at it and I’m sure there are a few exceptions to this rule, but I’m convinced that almost all SaaS startups that want to become big should strive for viral growth, negative churn, or both.
Related posts (from www.theangelvc.net):
Companies like Slack or Zendesk have shown that a superior user experience can provide a decisive competitive advantage and can become a critical success factor for SaaS businesses. Pundits might object that you don’t win enterprise customers by having a prettier interface. I think that’s shortsighted for at least two reasons.
First, user experience is not only about making the UI more beautiful. As legendary UX expert Jakob Nielsen defines it, “user experience encompasses all aspects of the end user’s interaction with a company, its services and its products”. An excellent user experience requires an elegant product that meets the needs of the customer and is a joy to use, but it goes beyond that. The design of your marketing website, the tone of voice of your marketing emails, interactions with customer service — all of this is part of the experience that you offer.
Second, today more and more buying decisions are made by the actual users of the software (e.g. someone in marketing looking for a marketing automation solution) as opposed to the IT department. When the buyer is also the user, usability becomes one of the key decision criteria. This decentralization of software buying, which has led to the consumerization of enterprise software both from a product as well as a go-to-market perspective, is maybe the most important driver of change in the software industry that we’ve seen in the last 5–10 years. But it’s far from over. Millennials arguably have even less tolerance for slow, bloated, ugly enterprise software. If you grew up with UBER and Spotify, if you’ve never ordered a cab by phone and never went to a store to order a CD, chances are you expect your work software to work flawlessly as well. :-) As millennials continue to rise up the ranks, a focus on great design and a delightful user experience will become even more important for software companies.
Two of our most successful SaaS investments to date, Zendesk and Typeform, owe a large part of their success to what I like to call a “10x” improvement in user experience over the status quo. It will be extremely interesting to see which companies can accomplish a similar quantum leap in 2017 and how it will look like. Will it be a SaaS solution with voice as the primary form of input? A mobile-first SaaS app that truly leverages the smartphone’s camera, sensors and other applications to provide a 10x better user experience? Or a software with a conversational interface, powered by a bot? I don’t have the answer, but I’m pretty sure that new ways to input data — methods that are more natural than dropdown menus or smartphone keyboards — will be a part of it.
Further reading:
Up until recently, the main job of software was to make people more efficient by digitizing paper-based processes, doing calculations and enabling more efficient communication inside and between companies. This has led to huge efficiency gains, and I honestly have no idea how companies used to be operated without computers until 40–50 years ago.
And yet, the biggest disruption is still ahead of us. I am, of course, talking about artificial intelligence (AI). How long it will take until AI will reach human intelligence — or if that’s never going to happen — is an extremely interesting topic that goes far beyond the scope of this post (and of course one that I’m not an expert in). It’s safe to assume, though, that software is getting better and better at more and more tasks which were previously thought to be impossible for computers to learn. Watson’s victory against two “Jeopardy” champions a few years ago and AlphaGo’s win against one of the best Go players are two legendary examples, but there are lots of other, less publicized cases, of computers winning against humans.
If close to 50% of jobs will be done by computers in the not too distant future, as an Oxford University study suggests, this will of course have unprecedented consequences for our society. How those consequences will look like, and if the net impact will be positive or negative for most people, is another extremely interesting topic that I’m not going to delve into here. What’s clear is that this disruptive force will create enormous opportunities for SaaS companies.
With today’s software it can sometimes be hard for a SaaS startup to prove the ROI of its product to prospective customers. Putting a dollar sign on the efficiency gains that a customer can realize by using your software can be difficult, and your product may provide lots of pretty intangible benefits that are hard to quantify. Now imagine that your SaaS solution allows your customers to get work done with significantly less people or maybe no people at all. In that case, the ROI will be pretty obvious.
What if future versions of sales automation software will not make your sales force more efficient but become your sales force? I can’t imagine how bots could take over sales calls … or wine and dine with a client. :) But think about jobs like web-based prospecting, lead qualification or email campaigns and the idea starts to sound a lot less far-fetched.
Although we developed a strong interest in AI in the last few years we have not yet seen a large number of “AI startups” that we fell in love with (one notable exception is our portfolio company Candis, which is automating accounting work). This could be because the industry is still at a nascent stage or because it’s still early days for us in terms of learning and developing an investment thesis around AI, or both. In any case, we’re excited to spend more time on this topic in the coming year!

One of the many reasons investors love Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based businesses are because of the predictability and visibility it provides into the future performance of the company. A great way to showcase this to investors is through a well thought out financial model.
A well built financial model is like a well-oiled machine, the more sophisticated the machine the more it is capable of doing. When building your financial think: do I want to build a bicycle or a rocket ship. Different machines are meant to serve different purposes, cater your model to its audience and the stage your company is at.
You have to know how to build a bike before you can build a rocket ship!
But building a financial model from scratch, regardless of the stage you’re at, can be hard and time consuming. Where do you start? What should you include? Do you have enough details or is it too detailed (yes that’s a thing!)…there are so many things to consider.
The first thing you may do is Google it — here’s what happens:
Pro-tip: templates are a good starting point (although I believe you should never pay for a financial model template), your business is unique and so should your financial model — don’t just blindly use a template. Think about the implications for your business and whether something applies or not. That said there are plenty of free templates and resources you can use to get started with, but remember to tailor it for your business.
In my role at SurePath Capital Partners, I’ve seen a fair share of financial models, especially for startup SaaS companies — although there are many similarities, each model is unique.
Outlined below are some of the key components every good model should have. I’ll discuss each in detail including best practises and things to consider when building a financial model for your SaaS startup. This is not meant to serve as a foolproof method to build an investor grade model, but should serve as a guideline and considerations for best practices. (Note a good financial model will have an Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow — in this post, I’m going to be covering the Income Statement in depth)
This is the most fundamental part of any financial model. A good sales plan has clearly identified drivers — the key factors that increase sales. This can be hard, but it is arguably the most important part.
Think: What is the ONE thing that my business needs to drive revenue?
Pro tip: do not just hardcode a revenue number and show it growing an arbitrary percent month-over-month (MoM). This is not well thought out. An investor wants to know the components of that number, so they can see how your business grows and becomes massive.
Here are a few examples:
Think about each stage of your sales funnel from a lead to a paying customer. Dissect it and assign values to how each stage converts to the next (use as much history/experience you have up to a maximum of the last 12 months).
Once you’ve thought through how your sales funnel brings in new customers each month, the next step is to think about your customer count over time.
Each month, you should show the following build up of your customers:
Beginning Paying Customers (the same as the customers you ended the previous month with)
Add: New customers acquired through your sales funnel
Subtract: Customers lost through churn (inevitably some of your customers will leave, or unsubscribe, you need to account for this through a monthly churn assumption)
Ending Paying Customers (this will be the number of customers that pay you this month)
Some Considerations:
Now that you’ve determined your customers in each segment (by product, annual billing, monthly billing), you’re ready to calculate the revenues generated.
Each segment of customers should have its own monthly price assumption (if you have an annual price — divide this by 12), which gets applied to the number of customers in that segment. Sum up all the segments, and you get the revenues for the month.
Pro tip: if you have different pricing for annual vs monthly billing, its a good idea to separate your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) from your cash received. Annual billing customers will pay you upfront so you have the cash on day 1 — but not all this is revenue, whereas monthly pricing you earn the revenue, as its paid. For more info on this difference, check out Tomasz Tunguz’s post.
You’ve nailed down your sales plan, but in order to execute, you need to build out your team. For a SaaS startup, Salaries and Benefits are almost always the largest expense — spend time on it and think it through!
When building up your hiring plan, separate your team into sections — the most common ones are:
Pro tip: The distinction between Sales and Marketing & Customer Success is sometimes not as clear, especially in the early stage — but Sales and Marketing costs should be included in your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), whereas Customer Success costs are not.
The important part of the hiring plan is accommodating for growth
The key here is to ensure you have scalable hiring: think of the capacity of your current team. This is typically a step function — think of it as, “For every X customers, I need 1 new team member (for whatever the relevant function is).
Some considerations:
You’ve done all the heavy lifting now; figured out how your sales will grow, and the team you need to execute on it, but what about the other expenses.
Generally, you should avoid hard coded expenses that do not dynamically change as your revenues grow. Think hard about the relationships between certain expenses how it links with revenues and other expenses. It is rare for an expense to stay absolutely constant as your business scales and grows.
There are 3 broad types of expenses:
Turn fixed costs into step costs.
Even if you have fixed costs for large intervals (ie. your current office can accommodate 30 people, you’re at 10 now), build in the functionality for how this cost scales when you have 40 people. A well thought out model will have accounted for this.
Below are some common expenses for SaaS startups and how to think about them:
Always think of how costs are related to other expenses or revenues, and how scaling impacts those costs!
There are a slew of great SaaSy metrics you can show and calculate, this provides investors the ability to see how profitable your business is for EACH incremental customer (commonly referred to as unit economics) you bring into the machine.
David Skok has an awesome post on calculating and benchmarking SaaS metrics here.
You don’t need to show all of them — show the key ones, highlight the ones that make your business great!
At the bare minimum, include these 5 from the Kiss Metrics post.
Every model is different and unique, but these are some best practises to follow for any financial model
Creating a financial model is hard work, but it isn’t rocket science. It requires time and thought — it’s not something you can rush and slap together the day an investor requests access to your data room. You need to think things through — think about things both ways. Revenues can’t just go up 100% while all your costs stay the exact same.
This isn’t meant to be a foolproof post on creating a financial model (no post will ever be foolproof — every startup is different and unique), but hopefully it serves as a guideline and gets you thinking about certain things you need to consider when building an investor grade financial model for your SaaS startup.

「潜在顧客のリードをいかにして獲得するか？」
B2Bのスタートアップの方とお話させて頂く中で、日々よく話し合うトピックの1つだ。特に、創業初期のスタートアップの場合、リソースも無く、名前も知られていないのでチャレンジは大きい。言わずもがな、直営業や展示会、リファーラルでの紹介は重要。ただリソースも少ない中では、集められるリードの数は限られるし、何よりも効率が悪い。
そんな中で、個人的に「もっとやったらいいのに…」と思うのが、ブログ配信に代表されるコンテンツマーケティングだ。私もVCと言う、B2B向けサービスをやっている中で、コンテンツマーケティングの威力と重要性は痛感させられることが多い。ブログを書き出してからは、大企業/VC/起業家の方から「なんかB2Bのブログ書いてる人ですよね？」とお声を掛けて頂いたり、色んな登壇の場に呼んで頂いたり、非常に助けられている。
ただ、ブログを書いている自分が「コンテンツマーケティングが重要」というのも完全なポジショントークになってしまうので、SalesforceやHubspotなど、世界のSaaS企業トップ250社のコンテンツマーケティングの実態をまとめたcobloom社の「The State of SaaS Content Marketing 2017」より、客観的な数字で見たコンテンツマーケティングの実態と威力について紹介させて頂きたい。
まず世界のSaaSトップ250社の実態を見てみると、驚くべきことに250社中、227社が自社ブログを持っており、全体の89%を占める。250社のリストの中に、Siemensや富士通のような歴史のあり、ブログを持たない企業が少なからず混ざっていることを踏まえると、SaaSスタートアップでブログをやっているのは、ほぼ100%に近いと想定される。またPodcastをやっているSaaS企業も18%にまで昇る。
では、なぜ多くのSaaS企業でブログ等のコンテンツマーケティングが常識のように取り入れられているのか？その答えを端的に言うと、「旧来のマーケ手法より圧倒的に顧客獲得のROIが高い」からだ。下の図を見て頂きたい。訪問セールスやTV広告等の旧来からあるアウトバンドマーケティングと比べて、ブログなどのコンテンツマーケティングは顧客1リード獲得当りのコストが68%低い。更に、コンテンツマーケティング主体の方が、7.8倍のトラフィックを獲得できるという、メリットもある。つまりざっくり言うと、コンテンツマーケティングは「約1/3のコストで8倍の効果」がある強力なマーケ手法と言える。
次に、SaaS企業のコンテンツマーケティングの主流である、ブログについて深掘りしたい。SaaSのブログのコンテンツの中身を見てみると、大きくは、お役立ち系とPR系に分けられる。
お役立ち系：顧客の課題に対するハウツーの紹介や最新のマーケット動向に関するレポート など
PR系：企業の新たな取り組みの紹介やプレスリリースの詳細 など
特にブログでのパフォーマンスの高いトップ25社に絞ってみてみると、お役立ち系とPR系の両方の内容を提供している企業が40%を占め、続いてお役立ち系コンテンツのみ提供している企業が36%と多い。これは、後段で紹介するが、お役立ち系コンテンツの方がPR系より、リード獲得効果が得られるためだと考えられる。
そして、ブログで流入してきた潜在顧客が実際にどのような行動をとるか、その効果について見てみると、全体の33%はリード情報獲得にまでつながっており、非常に効果が高いことが判る。
その他、ブログをやっているSaaSトップ企業のトラフィックの詳細については以下の図に示す。もしブログをやられているSaaS企業の方はベンチマーク情報として、ぜひ活用してほしい。
続いて、SaaSトップ企業のブログの統計データから見た場合、SaaS企業がブログ投稿によるリード獲得を加速化する上でのtipsを紹介する。以下の図に示す通り、大きく3つの示唆がある。
1つ目は、SaaS企業が良く陥りがちだが、自社サービスの導入事例や会社の取組みの裏側など、PR系のコンテンツを作りがちだ。顧客からしてみれば、スタートアップに対して親近感を湧くかもしれないが、PR系のコンテンツでサービスを選ぶことはほぼ無い。顧客がSaaSなどのパートナー企業に求めるのは、「自分の業界にいかに精通していて、課題をいかに解決してくれるのか？」だ。なので、顧客視点のお役立ち系のコンテンツは実際PR系より7倍リード獲得に効果がある。（別の統計では、PR系コンテンツの場合、ユーザーから何も反応が無いケースが、お役立ち系の3倍ある。)
2つ目は、ウェブ検索での訪問数が多いブログは平均的なブログより12%長い。これはGoogleのアルゴリズムを踏まえた、SEO視点での効果のためだと考えられる。
3つ目は、ウェブ検索での訪問数と①バックリンク数(ブログ記事が他のサイトで引用されている数）と②参照ドメイン数(ブログ記事を引用しているドメイン数)の相関関係を見てみると、①バックリンク数の相関係数は0.22と相関が弱い一方、②参照ドメイン数の相関係数は0.72と強い相関がみられる。これも2つ目同様、Googleのアルゴリズムの影響だが、考えるべき重要なポイントと言える。
最後に、SaaS企業にとって参考となるSaaS企業のブログとして、HubSpotを紹介したい。以前、私も記事で取り上げたが、HubSpotはインバウンドマーケティングのSaaSの雄であり、月次のブログ訪問数180万回とトップ企業の平均の約3,000倍もトラフィックを持つ怪物企業だ。是非、ブログ記事を書く参考にして頂くと良いと思う。

Dollar retention is critical to the health of a SaaS company; companies should always understand if they acquire $100 of revenue today, what will that be worth over time? The best companies are usually able to show that $100 from a customer cohort in year 1 will grow to $120 or more by year 2, and over time that number could get significantly larger. This is called “net negative churn”. A SaaS company could be growing ARR (annual recurring revenue) over 100% each year, but if their annualized net dollar retention is less than 75%, there is likely a problem with the underlying business. The top-line growth will be masked for only so long — poor net dollar retention will almost always catch up and slow a business’s top line.
Depending on the business model, companies can increase their share of wallet from customers by increasing their users, selling them more products, marketplace revenue (if offered), other add-ons, and renewing them at higher pricing tiers. For example, Atlassian was able to show in their S-1 that $1 of spend in year 1 would become $7 of spend by year 5, on an indexed cumulative basis (see the image below).
I took the group of high-growth SaaS IPOs I track and benchmarked their net dollar retention rates. While most of the companies in the group disclose some type of retention metric, I only focused on dollar retention and left out logo retention. I will caveat this with saying that most of these companies define this metric in slightly different ways, so while it’s not quite apples-to-apples, it’s interesting to see nonetheless. Most even use a different term and some will leave out certain customer segments (i.e. Box excludes customers <$5K in ACV). Being on the underwriting side of SaaS companies in a previous role, companies tend to pick the most attractive definition. For those interested, here is a list of the companies’ dollar retention disclosure along with definitions.
See the chart below where I separated companies by type — net dollar retention figures (which includes upsells, etc.) and those that just disclose gross dollar retention (excluding the benefit of upsells).
You can see that almost all of these companies have net dollar retention figures (even if defined slightly differently) over 100% — the median is 117% for net dollar retention disclosure and 92% for gross dollar retention disclosure. There are a lot of factors that go into this number, such as end customer segment i.e. SMB or enterprise, pricing model, products available for upsell and cross-sell, etc., but SaaS companies should strive to be over 100% on a net basis.
Ideally, we’d be able to see this by customer segment, but it’s not disclosed. For example, Hubspot had a 90% net dollar retention figure at IPO, and today it’s over 100%. The company has been releasing more products and moving up-market where customers tend to churn less and can spend more. For best-in-class, high-growth private SaaS companies, the numbers are similar. If you look at slide 58 of the KeyBanc Capital Markets SaaS Survey (fka Pac Crest) you can see that the net dollar retention median is 101%. There were also many companies in the survey with well over 100% net dollar retention.
For private investors, net dollar retention is one of the most important factors when evaluating a SaaS company. I’ve seen great businesses add the same (or slightly less) amount of logos per year but still grow very quickly and efficiently due to high net dollar retention rates, even with similar average ACVs. In some cases, the number can be used to justify increased spend on customer acquisition — if a business consistently has annualized net dollar retention of over 140+% each quarter, it could be a good idea to spend more on customer acquisition, even if the paybacks are ~18+ months. Those cohorts can be very profitable over time. The contrary is also typically true; if a business has low net dollar retention (<75%) they should probably spend less on acquiring new customers and assess why their current customers are churning and/or spending less.
Net dollar retention has a huge impact on the long-term success of a business; the companies that get public usually have net dollar retention rates of well over 100%, and in some cases 150%+. It’s unfortunately at times overlooked, but increasingly becoming one of the most core KPIs for any SaaS company.

About two years ago, Josh Hannah of Matrix Partners wrote an excellent article titled “That’s a nice little $40M eCommerce company you have there. Call me when it scales.” In it he argues that an eCommerce business with $10 to $20 million in revenues is not that hard to build and also not very valuable. I would recommend that you read the full article, but one of the key points of the article was that if you fill a niche and have distinctive product/market fit with a set of customers, you can acquire customers very cheaply — up until a certain point, when you’ve maxed out the cheap customer acquisition channels and need to tap into more scalable channels. At that point it becomes a lot harder because the next set of customer acquisition channels will likely be much more expensive. As a side note I’d add that the value of an eCommerce business with $10–20 million in revenue can be even more deceptive if a company has burned a lot of money to get to this level and has very low (or even negative) gross margins. The reason is that in most categories online shopping has become ultra-transparent (something which I’m not completely innocent of ;-) ) and that there’s a group of highly price-sensitive customers which always goes for the lowest price. So if you start an online shop, offer products at a loss, get listed on some of the biggest comparison shopping sites and do some affiliate marketing, you can easily get to tens of millions in revenue. Now let’s talk about SaaS. In the last few years I’ve come to the realization that Josh’s observation can also be applied to the SaaS world: Building a SaaS business with $1–2 million in ARR is not that hard to build and not that valuable. Let me rephrase that. Starting a new company is always hard and most SaaS startups never get to $1–2 million in ARR. Every founder who accomplishes this deserves a huge amount of respect. The point is that getting to $1–2 million in ARR probably has less predictive value concerning a company’s ability to get to true scale than most people think — or at least thought some years ago. The reason, I think, is that over the last 5–10 years it has become much easier to build a SaaS product and get initial traction:
So — it has become much easier to develop and launch a SaaS application and get initial traction, but if you have product/market fit in a small niche, which many SaaS companies do, it may be very hard to expand beyond that niche. And even if your market is large in principle, keeping growth up after you’ve picked the low-hanging fruits and reached a few million dollars in ARR will become increasingly difficult. In order to go from a $1–2 million in ARR to $10 million and eventually $100 million, you’ll have to find highly repeatable and reasonably profitable ways to acquire customers at huge scale. With few exceptions that means you either need to have a viral product (a.k.a. as hunting mice) or you have to go upmarket and dramatically increase your ACV over time. Some SaaS businesses manage to do this and have a shot at building a $100 million ARR company, but for the majority of SaaS companies growth will taper off once they’ve reached a few million dollars in ARR, making it hard to ever grow significantly beyond $10–20 million. In a way, this isn’t surprising — not everyone can become a unicorn. :-) The non-trivial part of what I’m saying is that 5–10 years ago, many of these companies wouldn’t have gotten to a few million dollars in ARR. Put differently, there are more $100 million ARR SaaS companies today, but the number of companies in the $1–10 million ARR range has grown disproportionately faster. That’s my theory at least, it’s not scientifically proven. If my theory is true, will this be bad news for people in the SaaS industry? It’ll depend on who you ask. It could make seed and Series A investing harder because the percentage of seed and Series A funded SaaS startups that becomes really big would decrease — and VCs need large outcomes in order to make their business model work. But it would also lead to the generation of a large number of small-ish but still very viable SaaS businesses, many of which could generate very decent profits for their founders. From that point of view, there’s never been a better time to start a SaaS company. PS: You may have noticed that I’ve changed Josh’s “call me when it scales” to “call me to to discuss if it will scale”. Being a seed investor I’m trying to find SaaS companies that can scale before they have scaled. PPS: If you’re wondering why Josh talks about revenues in the $10–40 million range when he refers to sub-scale companies while I talk about $1–2 million in ARR: The reason is that besides the fact that SaaS revenues are recurring, SaaS margins are almost an order of magnitude higher than eCommerce margins. $1 in SaaS revenues is much more valuable than $1 in eCommerce revenues (all revenue is not created equal!).

Special thanks to Morgan Brown for contributing insights. ❤
When the right words appear in front of the right people, it’s like the copy from your page joins a conversation already happening in the minds of your prospects. It becomes a dialogue of “I wish I had this” and “Do you wish you had this? Let me show you how you can get it.”
The conversation continues from there, sometimes with other people, like user reviewers, chiming in just at the right moment. Sometimes with your marketer sending an email that is so perfectly timed your prospects wonder if you’re reading their minds.
In this conversation, your job is to convey a simple message of the value you have to offer. But, crafting that message is anything but simple. It all starts with…
Customer Success is a complete customer-lifecycle process that helps customers achieve success — whatever success means for them in the real world — with your SaaS so that you can decrease churn, increase revenue, and create an exponentially increasing mountain of new sales.
I’m not over-promising. When you nail Customer Success, those are the results.
This process begins with qualitative data research: Real feedback from real users. This research can help you form a unique value proposition to attract your ideal customers from the very beginning so that you (and they) can start achieving Customer Success, and all of the results that come with it.
At best, analytics can tell you what is happening, but they can never tell you exactly why. They can tell you a channel is underperforming or a page has a high bounce rate but those are symptoms, and you can either guess at the root causes or you can conduct qualitative research to get meaningful answers. When you’re investing time and money into growing a business, guessing becomes expensive. Running A/B tests or trying new things based on your own intuition or your team’s brainstorming without getting outside of the building is an easy way to waste time and money.
In fact, this is how many startups fail — or make fools of themselves. Remember the fiasco when iTunes gave everyone the latest U2 album?
When you try to guess what to improve upon or how to fix what’s wrong, it’s not just that you might waste time getting to what ultimately works, it’s that you might not ever make the change that really matters. As people, we’re great at coming up with options and ideas based on the combination of things we “see” or understand, but we’re not good at identifying the factors that may be completely off our radar.
As Donald Rumsfeld famously said, we’re not good at dealing with the “unknown unknowns.” Unfortunately, it can often be those unknown unknowns that are holding back Customer Success. And we’d never get to the answers ourselves. Unlike Sherlock Holmes, we usually can’t identify the dog that’s not barking. So research isn’t just about speeding up the process of finding wins — it’s essential to finding them in the first place.
Qualitative research breaks down into a few key buckets: surveying, interviewing and observing, and inbound analysis.
Here’s five steps you can use to gather, analyze and utilize qualitative research to continually improve your language — and ultimately rock your value prop:
Most SaaS companies don’t want to narrow their focus to an ideal customer, but this is critical. After all, how do you know what kind of language to use if you don’t have a clear picture of who you’re talking to?
Think you can write a sales page that appeals to everyone? Think again. Copywriters know that effective copy, the copy that converts into action, must be highly targeted on just one persona (or, at most, two — but they don’t recommend it!).
You can start identifying your ideal customer by using Lincoln Murphy’s Ideal Customer Profile Framework.
We’ll wait here while you do that.
Once you’ve identified your ideal customer, you need to determine how the market perceives their problems and your product through the language that you’re currently using on your website and marketing materials.
Language is the foundation of growth.
Here are four methods you can use to accomplish this:
This is pretty straightforward. Implement regular surveying of both website visitors and customer segments via onsite and email-based surveys. These include product/market fit, customer satisfaction, net promoter scores, demographic/psychographic profiles, product features and more.
Onsite surveying is great, but you can also end up getting feedback from people who aren’t your customers — ie. unqualified leads. This is not the feedback you want. Instead, focus on surveying the “qualified noes” (the people who are qualified but decided against buying anyway.) These are the people that can unlock real insights to improve your customer acquisition efforts.
There are two parts to talking to qualified noes: part one is asking your questions within the context of the right parts of the user experience to talk to qualified visitors; part two is asking the right questions.
You want to ask people who just bought what convinced them to buy, and people who abandoned at the last minute why they changed their mind. All of this is detailed well in this article about “golden questions” with Conversion Rate Experts and Sean Ellis.
Custom surveys via email are another important part of qualitative feedback. Ideally you have a regular survey that goes out to your user base on an interval — say every quarter — that asks the same set of questions about overall satisfaction, demographic data and more. This helps you understand if your product is improving or not, and how your user base is evolving.
In addition to regular surveys, you should survey your customers occasionally about new features or initiatives you’re thinking of launching. These can be stand alone, one-off surveys sent from time to time.
Targeting these to the right people is essential to get meaningful feedback.
For instance you don’t want to send new product feature surveys to users who haven’t logged in recently — if they don’t care about your old features, they aren’t likely to invest interest in the new ones.
You can get a lot more detail about how to survey users in Qualaroo’s Marketer’s Guide to Surveying Users.
Surveys are great for aggregate qualitative data, but they often only collect data around the issues you think are important — after all your team is writing the questions. So they are not always the best at getting to unknown unknowns. Free-form fields can help here, but they’re not as good as interviews and observing users.
Interviews, such as those done in usability studies, ethnographic research and customer development provide a much richer profile of users. They also help uncover unknown opportunities and issues. The key to interviews is to ensure you’re not leading the interviewee, and are able to elicit the insights and information you’re looking for. Interviewing is a skill, and whether it’s for usability research or customer development, knowing the right questions to ask and being able to put subjects at ease are critical to making the sessions valuable.
Ash Mayura does a great job of outlining the specifics to customer development issues in Running Lean and includes a specific format and question recommendations to help you get the most out of the interviews. Of course it’s critical that you’re interviewing the right types of people — people who are like the customers you are trying to attract or retain.
Beyond interviews, observation can be really valuable as well. Especially when it comes to usability it studies and ethnographic research, simply watching people interact with your product or service is highly instructive. You can do this remotely, with tools like UserTesting.com and Inspectlet, or you can do it in-person with some of the user testing studies outlined in Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug.
Ethnographic research has you observing users in their actual environment with your product. Watching someone work all day and then pick up their phone to use your app, or login to your service while trying to manage their leads, etc. is an incredibly illuminating experience that not only provides great context to understand how your users think about and use your product in relation to the rest of their lives, but it also creates a great deal of user empathy which is essential in creating new features, campaigns, etc.
Combining these individual deep dives with other qualitative feedback can help provide context to results and analytics data. All of this is proactive research led by the organization, but you also have a great deal of qualitative inbound data that you can take advantage of.
Complaints, support tickets, phone calls, posts on social media, reviews and chat logs are all founts of qualitative data that can be mined for insights. They can be structured, through tools like UserVoice, or they can be mined from unstructured data like support logs or Twitter mentions.
While most inbound customer feedback is simply used to manage complaints and triage issues, the growth team can use this feedback to find new opportunities for features and campaigns that can lead to growth. One of my favorite examples of this is from Bryan Eisenberg, who likes to show how different the language is in e-commerce product descriptions and the consumer reviews of the same product. By mining these reviews, e-commerce companies can find inspiration for everything from ad and landing page copy to new marketing channels to pursue.
User research is an important and rich area of opportunity for businesses. Most of the opportunity is squandered by a lack of action. As usability expert Jakob Nielsen said, even talking to just five users can lead to big insights and wins. By combining surveys, interviews, observations, and analysis of inbound customer feedback, growth teams can find brand new opportunities that can lead to big wins for their business.
As pointed out by Peep Laja on ConversionXL, your value proposition is the number-one thing you need to get right — and to test. It is a promise of the value to be delivered to the customer. It should be in the language of the customer and should join the conversation that’s already taking place.
To do this, you first have to understand what your customer needs (and what they’d like to gain), what their jobs are, and what their biggest pain points are. Don’t try to guess — use qualitative data gained from interviews and surveys of your ideal customers.
Then, look at what your product does, what benefits/gains it offers, and what pain points it relieves.
Where the two lists intersect is where you have problem/solution fit. And each “fit” becomes an ingredient of your value proposition.
Use this value proposition worksheet or Strategyzer’s value proposition canvas to get started.
Of course, when filling out the value proposition canvas, you’ll have to condense your users’ answers in order to make a list to compare and contrast with what your product offers. But don’t throw away the complete responses from your interviewees. This chart will help you find problem/solution fit (aka. product/market fit) and let you know exactly which benefits to highlight for your audience, but it won’t tell you which words to use that fit your audience.
Your audience already has.
Within the responses your interviewees give you are perfect little sound bites, snippets of sentences, or possible full paragraphs, that precisely express — in the raw language of your users — what your customers need, want and fear. Use these sound bites as they are (correcting only grammar and punctuation if necessary) in your copy.
When your copy — even your value proposition — captures the diction, tone, and feel of your target audience, they’ll recognize it as quickly as you recognize your own signature on a check. And it will speak to them.
Now that you’ve collected your qualitative data and put it to use in a working value proposition, it’s time to update the language on your landing pages.
You’ll need to continue to test your value proposition, so form a hypothesis for an A/B test and start testing to determine which variation has a greater positive impact on Customer Success metrics.
A/B testing may be simple, but it’s powerful. Much like the observation technique of gathering qualitative data, a good A/B test measures the real-world behavior of your customers.
Which metrics to look at depends on your goal. Is it lowering Cost to Acquire a new customer (CAC)? Is it monthly recurring revenue, or annual recurring revenue? Is it retaining customers after a typical “drop-off” point in your onboarding process?
Once you’ve chosen a metric and have a hypothesis — which can be as simple as “I think the new language will increase conversions on this page by 25%” — set up an A/B test to find out if you’re meeting your goal. If not, make one change and try again.
You may find that the issue isn’t your language but its presentation, so if you are confident in your value proposition and your on-page copy, you might try having your web design team change the placement of the text, the font, the color, etc. Don’t make lots of changes all at once, unless the page is brand new or severely underperforming. You need a benchmark to compare the new with the old.
The problem with A/B testing is that it doesn’t tell you why you’re getting the results you are, which is where qualitative data comes into play yet again. Once you’ve noticed that version B actually performs worse than version A, you can use on-page open-ended survey questions, or interviews, or any of the other qualitative data gathering methods to ask your customers “Hey, what about this page isn’t working for you?”
Then, iterate based on their responses and repeat the A/B testing cycle until you’ve optimized your value prop, or page, or onboarding process for customer success.
Qualitative data is at the heart of Customer Success initiatives — after all, how can you help customers achieve their successes unless you’ve first asked them what they are. With the foundation of insights ‘straight from the horse’s mouth’ you can build an empire.

SaaS investors spend a lot of time examining the different go-to-market models and sales efficiency of businesses. Given the nature of subscription business models, customer acquisition is one of the most important attributes of a SaaS business — the cost to acquire is up front and the customer pays ratably over the subscription period. It’s necessary to understand for every dollar that is spent in sales and marketing, what is the incremental subscription gross margin that the business gets back? Typically, investors like to see around a 1:1 ratio, which implies a one-year payback. But given the nuances around different markets, seasonality, churn, up-sell and size of deals, the ideal payback period can range from 6 months to maybe even two years depending on the nature of the business.
While I spend a lot of time with these metrics for private companies, I don’t typically look at them for public companies, so I decided to benchmark the sales efficiency among a group of public software businesses. I picked 20 companies out of the broad software group based on the following criteria; $500M+ market cap, growing ~30% YoY from 2015–2016, and trading at a high-growth multiple i.e. 4x+ EV / 2017 revenue (median of this comp group is ~6x EV / 2017 revenue). Overall, these companies represent almost $140B of market cap and in sum almost $16B of ARR based on CY Q2'16. (Note NetSuite was acquired in Jul-16 but I still wanted to include them in this analysis).
For these companies I looked at the past 8 quarters and pulled subscription or recurring revenue, gross margin and non-GAAP sales and marketing. Given these businesses charge on a subscription or recurring basis, I multiplied each quarter’s revenue by four to get an implied ARR figure. I also took subscription gross margin where it was reported. I then took the median CAC ratio over the past 8 quarters for each company and was able to calculate the implied payback period for each. There is a large range of scale between these businesses, with Salesforce at $7.5B of implied ARR and AppFolio at $100M. Interestingly, there wasn’t one recurring theme across the most efficient companies, but certainly some similarities. I’ve added more on that below.
In regard to CAC ratio, see the below chart. The median is actually .7, implying a longer than one-year payback.
Secondly, in regard to the implied payback period, see the chart below. Among this comp set the median is 16.3 months.
Is there anything we can learn from the most efficient companies? I dug a little deeper into the GTM of the companies with less than a one-year payback. It includes Paylocity, Shopify, Atlassian, Paycom, Veeva and Twilio. I wrote a few notes about each company’s GTM below:
Paylocity: SaaS SMB and mid-market payroll and HCM suite provider. Their average customer has ~100 FTEs. How are they so efficient in a market that is competitive and fragmented? Paylocity uses a regionally focused direct sales team who live and work in their territories. They also have a network of over 30,000 brokers where they generate ~30%+ of their ARR through referrals. Brokers affiliated with Paylocity have a large partner network where they can recommend HCM product offerings to customers (such as 401k, benefits and other insurance), of which Paylocity has over 200. This makes them a neutral party that enables the brokers without competing with them.
Shopify: SaaS small merchant eCommerce and physical retail solutions provider. Their ideal customer does less than $1M in annual revenue. Shopify has enabled small merchants to have sophisticated, yet easy to use tooling and a partner network previously only large eCommerce or retail vendors had access to. Given this leadership position, great product and network, most of their customers are acquired organically (~40% of customers were acquired by word of mouth at their IPO). Another 30% come through their partner referrals and the remaining 30% from ad spend on Facebook and Google. They also did not have an outbound sales force until recently, and they are typically only focused on Shopify Plus!, which costs $1,00 or more a month and is their premium offering.
Atlassian: SaaS and on premise software for technical teams to collaborate, plan and build software. Their main product, Jira, is software for developers to track and manage tasks and represents a majority of their revenue. Atlassian has been incredibly efficient in its GTM and uses a low-friction, self-serve sales model. They do not discount on price and are mostly selling to individual developers or technical teams through word of mouth and online ads. They also do not have a direct sales staff. What they do save in sales and marketing they invest in research and development to keep creating great products that developers love. Given the collaborative nature of their products, the numbers of users at a given customer increases over time, increasing account sizes significantly.
Paycom: SaaS SMB HCM and payroll vendor. Paycom also has a unique GTM. They have inside and regionally-based field reps, and do not hire sales reps from competitors, but train and develop them internally (reps have little or no previous sales experience). Management says this enables them to ensure quality. New sales offices take a unique approach as well — the company takes a proven sales manager from an existing team and then relocates him/her to the new office location. The team is then fully staffed slowly rather than all at once, with a strict adherence to quality and efficiency. It takes two years for a new sales office to mature into full productivity. At the IPO, many reps were selling more than $1M in ACV/year and sales compensation has been steadily increasing over time.
Veeva: SaaS solutions for the life sciences industry, with the core product being a CRM for pharma and biotech reps that supports a wide range of industry specific functions. The company has continued to broaden their product suite and are considered to be an end-to-end workflow provider for the life sciences industry. The industry is large and complex and was slow to move to the cloud due to high compliance and regulation. Veeva was the first to build a SaaS platform that fit their business and compliance needs. Veeva sells through a direct sales force that targets two groups 1) research and development teams and 2) commercial teams which includes sales and marketing. They are considered to be the only viable SaaS platform for enterprises in the industry.
Twilio: SaaS developer-focused platform that enables companies to operate real-time communications — SMS, voice, video and authentication within software applications. Similar to Atlassian, Twilio has targeted the individual developer with a self-serve business model and great product. Twilio evangelizes its platform through developer-focused events and hackathons to fill the top of the funnel. Twilio can also be trialed for free and this low friction model gets developers using the product, which eventually leads to paying customers. There are almost 1 million developers using Twilio today. The company has also started building out an enterprise field sales team to focus on large customers.
Salesforce on the other hand, has some of the worst sales efficiency in the comp group. Why is this? While I don’t know exactly, I suspect that earlier in the company’s life cycle their sales efficiency was probably quite good. One theory I have is that they have such a large and profitable existing customer base, they can afford to acquire customers with less than stellar efficiency because they have the margin to support it. They are also mostly focused on large enterprises with high acquisition costs, but high ACVs. NetSuite I would suspect is in a similar position with regard to the large, profitable customer base.
Overall, there isn’t one, specific recurring theme across the most efficient companies, but it’s clear that a strong brand, great product and continued development, self-service and word of mouth (organic) traction has a lot to do with an efficient sales organization. There also isn’t a target market that is most important either — Paycom, Shopify and Paylocity focus on the SMB and mid-market, whereas Twilio, Atlassian and Veeva focus on medium to large enterprises (although Twilio and Atlassian sell to the individual developer). I’m looking forward to tracking these companies over time and seeing what new models earlier-stage SaaS companies employ.

aka “How to increase customer LTV for only $5 and 15 minutes.”.
I am a big supporter of SaaS start-ups; in fact, I’ve paid for dozens of subscriptions in the last few years. I’ve clicked on promoted tweets, those cleverly-crafted PPC ads, well written blog posts, signed up for countless free trials, and handed over my credit card details to some of the luckier products.
Now that I am officially a startup founder myself, in the B2B SaaS space, I know the hours of effort that goes into tuning your growth and on-boarding new trials or customers. Wow, it can be lots of work.
It can literally cost wads of cash, depending on the product and target audience, to get the prospects attention, and give them enough motivation to hand over their details and convert them to a free trial.
Not all products are under $10 a month either; some have been in the $500 per month category, but guess what?
Most of them have made me feel a little cheapened once I start receiving my monthly receipts.
Why?
Because I mostly (not always) only ever receive automated monthly receipts from these startups.
Heck, you’ve spent a bit of your runway getting that growth hack, those PPC campaigns, that flashy landing page and the great drip email on-boarding. You’re watching (possibly a little obsessively) the conversion rates, the email open rates and the clicks.
But once I paid my money, many of these companies never took the effort to thank me. They chatted me up, I eventually relented and bought them dinner, now they aren’t speaking to me.
Is it really that hard to do? To reward your actual paying customers? It goes a long way to customer loyalty and retention (Yep, I’ve cancelled many subscriptions over the last five years too).
Since we launched our employee survey start-up in late March of this year, I’ve been conscious how we treat those customers that hand over their coins.
I want to share three things that we do, and would love to hear anything that you’ve found works for you. I want to encourage every start-up out there (particularly the ones I am paying) to consider doing at least something once a customer starts paying, besides sending an email receipt.
Before we begin, yes, we’re in the small traction stage of only having a small customer base (it’s early days for us still), however we are bootstrapped as well, so we are well aware that every cost really counts.
Those who argue you can’t do this with a $500,000 MRR, or with so many customers signing up each day are missing the point. You can stop reading now if you like.
So here are three low cost activities we do at 6Q to say thank you to every new paying customer.
Yep, that’s me. It isn’t time intensive for me, and sure, when we on-board 100 customers a week, I may feel differently, however I know many of these startups I have used haven’t been any bigger than we are now.
It takes me all of 1–2 minutes to shoot out a ‘Hey Customer, thanks for signing up with us. I’m happy to have you join our journey, and please reach out if you need anything! Regards, Miles’. I have all their details in our system, so I don’t have to research anything.
Heck, when we hit 100 signups a week, I could even template it if I wanted, or worst case, delegate it to one of the team to send on my behalf.
Time: 2 minutes per customerCost: 2/60th of my hourly wage.
I always get so excited when I open my mailbox to find anything other than junk mail or paper invoices. There’s a little giddiness you feel, when you get a real-life, hand-written envelope in the mail. Especially if you don’t expect it.
I went out one day, and bought a bunch of greeting cards that say thank you, and a roll of stamps. We hand write in each one and send it within a week of a new sign-up.
This is obviously a little labor intensive; a few minutes of effort, as well as a $2 card and envelope, and postage, which varies from 70 cents to $2.70 depending on where we’re sending it.
(As an aside, see the coffee cup in the above picture? We had a handful of these made, and handed these out to our first customers, as a way of saying thanks; sure they cost $10 each, but we wanted to spoil the first few customers who invested in us).
Time: 5 minutes per customerCost: Up to $4.70.
We have a special list, just for our paying customers, or our Very Important People (in fact, I prefer the term co-creators or partners).
This email goes out every couple of months to our paid customers. It’s called VIP for a reason; these customers are handing over their hard earned dollars, so the least I could do is share some behind-the-scenes knowledge with them.
In fact, I use it for feature validation — I share details about what features we’re thinking about adding in the short term, and ask our customers for feedback on them, and best of all, we listen to what they say. Why wouldn’t we? They’re paying for our product.
Time: 30 minutes per newsletterCost: A few cents per customer.
These are just three ways we’ve found that make customers feel special, and (we hope!) continue using our product. All up, in total, they take under 15 minutes per new customer, and under $5. Even on our cheapest monthly subscription, it’s only a small slice of their first months income.
Sure, it adds a little to our costs, but I see these activities as more of an investment; if these simple things help keep our retention high (therefore increasing LTV), then they have more than done their jobs. All we set out to do really, was make these people feel a little special for trusting in our startup and product vision.
Do you have any suggestions for other low cost ways to thank your new customers? If you aren’t making an effort to say thank you, perhaps you should?
UPDATE: I’ve posted a new article about one start-up that has done an amazing job.
Go on, start today, don’t leave it for another month.

This post is part of our series covering the SaaS world. Subscribe to our P9 Capital Medium Channel if you want to be kept informed of our next articles.
I’m tracking what’s going on in the SaaS world for some time now and I’ve definitely noticed the rise of bootstrapped SaaS startups in our industry. This trend is not new but I have the feeling it’s accelerating. I meet and speak with more and more founders which run this kind of businesses (and are very happy about it).
So naturally when I saw that on Nathan Latka public SaaS metrics spreadsheet there were 12 of them, with a breakdown of their core metrics, I decided to make a comparison with the VC funded startups of this same list. And here are the results:
EDIT: Just a quick note to insist on the fact that I don’t pretend this a representative sample nor that this list is 100% accurate. I’ve received some emails from founders of companies on that list and already made some corrections (which didn’t change the metrics dramatically).
This is probably the data point which surprised me the most. The average MRR of the bootstrapped startups on this list is $364K and the median value is $227K, compared to $599K and $329K for the funded ones, knowing that the median value raised by funded businesses is $1.2M (and average = $5.8M).
I have to admit that I was expecting lower figures, for instance if you take the data from open SaaS startups I get an average MRR of $40k and a median value of $8k (which is also what I generally observe when I speak to bootstrapped SaaS founders).
With a $227K MRR you are already at $2.7M ARR which is above the $1.5M threshold that JML defines as the “self sustaining engine”. Serious businesses. Many funded SaaS don’t reach that point.
Churn
As expected no big difference in terms of churn (both groups are around 5% of monthly customer churn) as both funded and bootstrapped startups target the same type of customers (small accounts rather than enterprise). More money doesn’t guarantee a stickier product.
Sales Model
When you compare the LTV and average number of customers you understand that the vast majority of these 37 SaaS companies sell to small accounts and are not selling to the enterprise world (there a few in the list though, all VC backed).
In terms of customer base the bootstrapped startups are doing a great job with a median value of 2788 customers (which is impressive).
Team size
This data point was also surprising to me with a median value of 13.5 teammates for bootstrapped SaaS companies versus 16.5 for funded ones. Not a big difference again.
1 — The different metrics might be close for several average and median values but if you look at the 14 companies which have reached $500K of MRR only 2 are bootstrapped.
I cannot say that this is a representative sample (many more bootstrapped SaaS with higher revenue exist) but I think it’s realistic to think that past a certain ARR (around $5M -$6M?) bootstrapped startup are clearly outnumbered by VC funded startups.
2- The core SaaS metrics (churn, LTV etc…) are really close when we look at companies targeting the same group of customers. Clearly being funded doesn’t help that much when it comes to lowering your churn or improving your LTV (unsurprisingly).
3- That being said, VC money helps companies scale faster. In our top 14 of SaaS with MRR > $500K the two bootstrapped startups were founded in 1999 and 2007. It took 16 years for Aweber to reach $2M of MRR. It took 5 years for SeamlessDoc to reach almost the same stage. The majority of funded companies with a MRR > $500k were funded after 2010. Money doesn’t buy better core metrics but it buys growth speed. Profitability is another important topic but I cannot speak about that as we lack data. It’s easier to reach a certain revenue if you don’t care about profitability and just burn but we don’t know how far from profitability are all these startups.
4- Many bootstrapped founders face a choice once they manage to reach several hundreds of $ in MRR: continue to grow at their own pace or to accelerate growth by taking money from VCs.
5- I bet we’ll see an increasing number of great bootstrapped SaaS grow past $500K in MRR. Reasons:
Another consequence is that not only we’ll see more great bootstrapped startups emerge but the cycles will also shorten. Just look at companies like Converkit which could reach $240k of MRR in less than 3 years. This wave is already coming. The issue for them will be to scale beyond $1M in MRR with such high churn.
6- The majority of the bootstrapped startups listed here (and that I know myself) are targeting SMBs / small accounts. Maybe “enterprise grade” bootstrapped startups are under the radar or rarer or maybe this is a model which is inherently more capital intensive. I don’t have a clear explanation but if you do please share it in the comments.
Edit: Here is a insightful answer from Timothy B. Jones (or in the comments below)
From a founder pov it’s a great time because they probably never had so many options available. I currently see three models of SaaS companies growing:
From a VC point of view it’s also a very interesting time. Early revenue (and early revenue growth) is probably less meaningful than it was a couple of years ago. You can invest in a fast growing early SaaS (in terms of revenue) but if the core metrics (churn, LTV etc…) are not great it will be hard to scale the business at one point, and this path is not VC friendly.

Here I’m going to share my experience on creating a SaaS webservice with a simple LAMP stack and making it earn $3700 per month (actually it made around $7000 before the Russian currency had tanked). This story has nothing to do with investors, the Silicon Valley gold rush, and über modern technology. Just a simple story from an indie developer about making a profitable SaaS anyone could have built. I developed this webservice for the Russian domestic market, so I’ve translated everything into English and USD for convenience. Otherwise, this experience is pretty general and could be adopted anywhere. It’s a blueprint.
Three years ago I decided to tap into social media marketing and the easiest way to do that seemed to start my own group in a niche and to try to grow it. Facebook was already getting competitive, so I started my test group on its Russian counterpart, Vk.com. I picked a very popular niche because all I wanted was to learn, not to dominate the market.
To add some context I should note that Vk.com had and still has a flourishing ecosystem of these groups which is profitable for marketers. The market that Facebook choked a long ago. So this bazaar was a perfect environment to learn and experiment.
Okay, back to the group. The first issue I came across when developing my group was sourcing and generating new content. It was an image plus some text mostly, and most groups just copied content from their competitors, who in many cases had also copied it from somewhere else. Usually, it was the content of authors that were difficult to track and attribute the work to. Sometimes it was blatant plagiarism.
Anyway, I always hated manual labor and decided to make a little tool to help me scrape the posts of my competitors (who had scraped them from elsewhere anyway) and publish them to my group on a regular basis. Vk.com had a neat API so everything was super easy to setup. I scraped a lot of posts and designed a little interface that helped me go through them and remove inappropriate content, like the posts with links, obscene language, and very few likes. I’d also removed the posts that were obviously copyrighted.
I ended up with a scraping and publishing tool with its own database of high-quality posts relevant to my niche. Having this, I could spent zero time on content issues and could focus on marketing, which was my primary objective.
Although I tried to keep everything under the radar, one of my competitors noticed unusually stable and consistent flow of high-quality posts in my group and decided to ask me about it. I explained the system to her and she offered me something like $200 for it.
I turned the offer down and asked her to pay me monthly instead. She agreed.
That was the inception.
My crude tool lacked everything a mature web service should have, except the core functionality itself. It had one big advantage, though—it had already been validated, so I could invest heavily in its infrastructure because apparently Vk.com wasn’t the only social network I was going to be asked to support.
Also, from my previous startup, I knew that I need a sophisticated statistics and logging system to track down and fix all sorts of bugs as promptly as possible. I realized that I’m going to have a lot of them because when your project depends heavily on other services, their bugs, become your bugs.
I made a brief list of features for my MVP. It was quite long because I decided to include some stuff I usually avoid in the minimum viable product, like automated payments and all the additional interfaces.
Here is what I needed and what I had had eventually:
The payment gateway. Since the startup was supposed to operate on the Russian market I picked one of the most popular gateways there, Robokassa. It would have been Stripe but they didn’t work in Russia and still don’t, and bothering with setting up a Delaware company was pointless, not financially viable and too much hassle.
Robokassa fees were far from optimal, and I’ve already replaced it with Yandex.Checkout but it was okay enough to start with.
Content classified by niche. I decided to start with just the three most popular niches and working from there. These included: business and motivation, male-oriented general content, and female-oriented general content. For this, I had created a spicy mix of public domain content, some supposedly copyrighted content from unknown authors, and the posts from the groups that gave me their permission in exchange for me including their logo watermarks. That was enough to start.
The publishing engine. Vk.com was the first and probably the biggest (remember, we’re not in the global market) social network I had to support. However, I realized that I’ll also have to support Facebook, Twitter, and Ok.com (the Russian Classmates.com copycat), so I needed to implement some sort of stubs for them. Eventually, I just made a single function that called the API methods of the uplink social network for each group ready to be serviced, and added it to a CRON job. The CRON job fired up every 15 minutes.
Here is the mock up of the function:
Yes, that’s a super crude and unprofessional approach. Perhaps, I’d better have used some existing queue solution, but as I always say, I don’t consider myself a developer and not knowledgeable about modern implementation. I do all programming myself at the beginning because it’s fast and gives me the opportunity to react to user feedbacks with supersonic speed. After that, I happily delegate this job to someone smarter than me.
Comprehensive statistics and logging. In my previous projects, everything usually went haywire precisely because of the lack of data to analyze trends and errors. This time I didn’t want to make that mistake and decided to collect as much data as I could from the beginning.
When it comes to statistics and logging it’s tough to overdo it. In order to make informed decisions, you need to have tons of data of every single part of your service, especially if it’s the pricing.
The billing. Some of the uplink social networks (yes, I’m looking at you, Vk.com and Ok.com) were unreliable, so I decided not to use the subscription model and opted out for charging users on a per-post basis instead. This way I didn’t have to worry much if I couldn’t deliver the content to my customers if there were some issues with the social networks.
When I had everything set and ready, it was high time to think about how to generate the first customers.
At the time I had very limited budget and to spend it on paid advertisement was insane. So I had to figure out ways to acquire users for free.
The objective boiled down to this: I needed to find a way to contact group owners and not get blocked for being spammy. Clearly, direct messaging wasn’t an option.
However, I noticed that groups had an interesting feature. Anyone could suggest a post to a group that after a review allowed the owner to re-publish. This feature had already been profoundly abused but if done properly, it could still work.
I picked a bunch of groups in the niches Postio (that’s what I called the service) had content for and started to suggest them posts like one in the screenshot below.
As I was a group owner myself I knew how to compose a compelling post that would pass the watchful and experienced eyes of most moderators.
Results were quite impressive, nearly 70% of the owners I’d suggested posts to, signed up to Postio. Around 60% of those who had signed up topped up their balance in the system. Some of them even reached me on social networks to thank for making such a product. Those were the most satisfying moments, I guess.
Beside doing this post suggestion trick, I also published a post in my own group and offered Postio to the group owners subscribed to it. I knew that many of them had been reading groups of each other to monitor trends, posts, and the ecosystem in general. That generated some additional sign ups and paying customers.
At the end of the month, I had these stats.
That was nice, but I still hadn’t figured out how much I’m going to charge my customers. It was time to fix it.
I had no idea of the exact price that users were willing to pay for this sort of job, so I’d just set it to $0.01 per post. However, as I said many times in my previous articles, this random approach to pricing is quite costly. Even the slightest mistake (whether it’s undercharging or overcharging) can easily cost you a fortune in the long run.
So I decided to apply my usual approach and to figure out the price that would bring the highest revenue. I assigned a random price from a predefined set to each user upon the sign-up and monitor all activities associated with each price.
Here is what it looked like in code.
By scattering the incTestValue method across the code I could collect all metrics for a particular price I needed.
After a while, I had these stats on my hands.
Remember that the original currency wasn’t USD so this is why the fee column expressed in dollars looks strange.
This split-test had revealed some pretty interesting points:
Anyway, two cents per post was the most profitable price at this stage so I went with it. That didn’t necessarily mean that it would always be the case. It’s probable, as Postio evolves users will be willing to pay more but it’s subject to another test later on.
Now, as we have our hard earned data-driven price, let’s scale it a bit.
Besides increasing the number of niches and social networks my service supports, there were some other things I could do. A few customers asked me for some tool for processing the images that they attach to their posts. Features like rounding the corners, adding some effects, and placing watermarks. It was a perfect opportunity to upsell.
I had implemented a simple interface that allowed users to set their own image preferences. Each effect had its separate price and was added up to the base price of a post. Here’s what it looks like.
I’d say it was quite barbaric and stupid to charge users like that, but hey we all were young once.
The algorithm that processed these effects was pretty straightforward. It was just a function with a lot of arguments and some Imagemagick-based code inside.
I added extra columns to the stats table indicating what effects users applied and how often they did it. This feature gained momentum quickly.
Also, I added a lot of other features like pauses, custom posts upload, and support for multiple accounts, but these details aren’t interesting so let’s fast-forward a bit and see what I did with traffic.
I had a very limited budget of something like $500, so buying traffic directly wasn’t an option. However, I noticed search traffic was organically growing to the main page which had keywords that were related to my niche but didn’t belong to it directly.
After quick traffic volume analysis of those keywords, I decided to invest the whole budget into two areas: writing articles for the most popular search requests, and buying promotional posts from bloggers in my niche.
I collected the list of keywords that my users asked in search engines the most and hired a copywriter to create articles based on them. We produced “how to make a vk group”, “how to make a menu in a vk group” and others.
After the articles had been published in Postio’s help section, I negotiated special prices with the most promising bloggers in my niche and they made several posts about the service.
All this hustle had increased search engine traffic like this:
By the way, the majority of this traffic landed on one article about making a menu for a Vk.com group. That lead to the making of my another SaaS that I’ve described in this story. Take a look at it, it’s fun too.
To put the cherry on the cake, I’d also implemented an affiliate program. It was pretty simple: users had a unique link that they used to invite other users and receive 10% affiliate fee of their spendings. Nothing fancy but this source accounted not only for like 15% of all sign-ups but also got Postio some high-quality backlinks from various mediums. Which obviously didn’t hurt its search engine rankings.
It took 14 months to reach $3700 ($7000 back then) monthly profit and the only major loss was the depreciation of the currency this service worked with.
Making a profitable SaaS is never easy and it’s impossible to explain every aspect of it in a small article like this. But It’s entirely doable by almost any developer. You don’t need a partner, an investor, or even a great idea. Just start doing something and you’re inexorably going to stumble upon some issue ready to be solved. Nothing is perfect, and that’s good news.
I hope this story was of any help and as usual I’m open to any questions either here or on my Twitter.

East Coast investors have a reputation for being sticklers around numbers, and not “buying the dream”, the same way our West Coast brethren tend to. In this piece I’m going to double down on the first part, and continue to strongly deny the second…
One of the most common oversights of a seed stage SaaS company is not thinking about unit economics at the early stages of their business. Far too frequently we see strong founding teams raise a seed and unfortunately fail to close an A because unit economics never came close to working even though they thought they actually were working. These situations are avoidable IMO, and simply requires some conversation around the unit economics framework and theory.
We all know the basic unit economic math. However, it is the theoretical framework that can lead to significant adjustments in the actual numbers, and ultimately a differing POV between investors and entrepreneurs during a fundraise. These adjustments lead to understandably frustrated entrepreneurs who feel like investors are giving them a moving target. On the other hand, investors are discouraged when LTV / CAC goes from the 10x represented in a deck to a 2x after making what are, in their eyes, basic adjustments to the calculations.
There are quite literally hundreds of articles on unit economic math, but for completeness here is a very brief overview.
LTV = [1 Year of Gross Margin $] X [Expected Lifetime of a Customer in Years]
CAC = [Fully Burdened Sales and Marketing Expense in Period X] / [# of New Customers in Period X]
Before jumping into the math and variables above, it’s important to understand the spirit behind the LTV / CAC formula. The formula is a measure of sales efficiency but also (primarily at the early stage) a fantastic tool to understand business model feasibility vis-à-vis potential for future operating leverage. Operating leverage is not talked about enough at the early stage. It simply asks; if I continue to scale my business at the current unit economics, can I have a profitable business at some point in time?
Think of a P&L stripped down to three very basic line items; revenue, variable expenses (the expenses captured in an LTV / CAC formula; gross margin in LTV, and S&M in CAC), and non-variable or fixed expenses (the expenses NOT captured in LTV / CAC e.g. rent, overhead, back office salaries, etc). If your LTV / CAC equals 1x, your business will never enjoy operating leverage (make money) because the gross margin is only enough to pay for the variable expenses associated with obtaining that revenue, and not the fixed expenses of the business. In other words, the gross margin only covers the S&M expenses associated with obtaining that margin (CAC), and not the rent, overhead or back office salaries.
Generally speaking, investors look for an LTV / CAC ratio of greater than 3x. At 3x, you’re making some money on those customers that you acquired and more importantly you’ve created a product and paired it with an acquisition strategy that fits and will hopefully scale. Your gross margin pays for its CAC and contributes further to the bottom line (net income) of the business.
Now, let’s dissect the variables of the formulas because this is where the miscommunication often occurs between investors and entrepreneurs.
LTV = [1 Year of Gross Margin $] X [Expected Lifetime of a Customer in Years]
1 year of gross margin or 1 year of revenue minus COGS
There are two types of revenue; recurring and non-recurring. For your LTV analysis, you’ll want to only use the recurring piece of the contract as captured in your ACV (annual contract value). If your contracts are annual recurring for $1M with a $100k up-front onboarding / professional services, you’ll want to use your $1M, and dis-include the $100k (note that some businesses have very high margin on their professional services, in which case you can make the argument for adding that one time gross margin to your LTV if that’s the case for every customer). The ACV that should be used is the median number across all current contracts. If there has been a consistent rise in ACVs over the last few quarters, there is a case to be made for skewing larger as opposed to a pure median. However, the average number is almost always skewed by a few large deals (particularly at the early stage) that are not representative of the typical deal you’re signing.
COGS is where a lot of mistakes can be made. For a SaaS company, COGS should include any expenses that are variable and go into the creation, onboarding, maintenance and support of the software. This includes hosting, 3rd party licenses, data agreements, and headcount around deployment, maintenance and customer support. The mistakes made here are generally around the headcount.
LTV = [1 Year of Gross Margin $] X [Expected Lifetime of a Customer in Years]
The expected lifetime of a customer at the early stage cannot be calculated with just math because your total operating history is hopefully shorter than your expected customer lifetime value. That said, the basic math formula (the non-basic and right way to do this is by looking at monthly customer cohorts + churn) is; 1 / annual churn % = lifetime in years. If you’re churning 20% of your customer base per year, that means it’ll take 5 years to go to zero, or a 5 year customer lifetime. What this does not mean is that if you’re a 2 year old SaaS business signing annual contracts with 5% churn, you have a customer lifetime of 20 years. In my own analysis I use 4–5 year lifetimes as a proxy for a healthy early stage company with annual contracts. If a company is purely SMB, or routinely signs longer 2–3 year contracts, the lifetime will flex very slightly down and up from there respectively.
The logo churn rate is the best indicator for an investor at the early stage to estimate customer lifetime. The formula here is; # of lost customers in period / # of customer at beginning of period. All things being equal, I have to assume that going forward all of your customers (across verticals and sizes) are going to churn at the same rate. Said differently, I cannot throw out a 15% logo churn period from two months ago simply because they were SMB or from XYZ vertical which you’ve recently learned is no longer relevant. A caveat here is that if there is a substantial amount of historical data (at least 12 months) that can prove churn rates really do vary across groups, adjustments can and should be made to the LTV model.
The other common mistake we see made in this analysis is using negative revenue churn to justify a very long customer lifetime. This is apples to oranges. The argument is that if upsell is high enough in a cohort to have the offsetting effect of zero churn in a period, customer lifetime should not be negatively dinged. The way we’d run the analysis is a shorter lifetime in years, with a higher ACV driving the numerator in the LTV formula.
Logo churn is far more telling than revenue churn at the very early stages. Logo churn means a customer didn’t work out and proactively decided to stop using the software. As an investor, it leads me to question whether or not the software works for that specific vertical or customer size. Is TAM inherently limited or was this just a bad individual customer experience? Oftentimes it’s the latter and the customer experienced early product bugs or the pitfalls of a constrained support org — things that are serious, but fixable. In any event, it’s a good idea to proactively address these potential concerns, and ideally with referenceable current and churned customers.
CAC = [Fully Burdened Sales and Marketing Expense in Period X] / [# of New Customers in Period X]
The cost to acquire a customer (CAC) is straightforward. CAC equals all of your sales and marketing expenses in a period divided by the number of new customers that those costs helped to sign up. The expenses include marketing, advertising, events, content, and fully loaded headcount for S&M (benefits, commissions, etc). Every organization is structured differently, but if the individual has a hand in anything related to the funnel, they should be included. Marketers, content creators, SDRs, sales engineers, sales reps, etc.
One thing that is an almost certainty at the early stage is that your CAC will increase over the short term. This makes sense because you don’t know who your successful customers will be, your keywords are not optimized and your sales organization lacks late stage sophistication and efficiency. Below is my attempt at illustrating the CAC trend of an average company throughout its full lifecycle. [Disclaimer 1: Trend lines are dramatic to illustrate the path. Disclaimer 2: The slopes and relation of the peaks and valleys vary across companies.] One of the jobs of an early stage investor is to try and estimate how high that first peak will go. It is at that point of repeatability in the sales process that a company starts to see a decline in CAC, and usually a very solid growth equity investor comes in to pour gas on the fire.
Given this trend and expectation on behalf of investors, it’s worth visiting the LTV / CAC target of 3x again. All things being equal, if CAC was the only variable that we expected to increase over time, we probably don’t write the investment check. A great SaaS company will also be able to tell the story of rising ACVs and GMs very clearly, and ideally with few data points. This can come by way of new features, selling upstream or simply increasing prices.
The reality is that no one knows what the unit economics will be until there is a product out in the wild that is being sold. Bill Gurley said it well in this post on unit economics from 2012. “It’s at best a “good guess” about how the future will unfold. Businesses are complex adaptive systems that cannot be modeled with certainty. The future LTV results are simply predictions based on many assumptions that may or may not hold.”
With that said, we’re at a point in time where there are enough comps in the market for new founders to build unit economic models with their best guess of forecasts. Are you selling to SMBs? You’re probably looking at smaller ACVs with higher churn. Are you building a product to dethrone a current incumbent? You’ll likely get similar ACVs with higher CAC initially as you attempt to displace their solution.
As an East Coast investor / stickler for unit economics, I find founders show best when they enter early stage conversations armed with this type of market data. While it’s absolutely not the most important topic during a fundraise, knowing how and why the formulas exist lend to a productive conversation between founders and investors.

Top highlight
This post is part of our series covering the SaaS industry. To be kept informed of our next stories you can subscribe to our Point Nine Capital Channel
In 2015 during the whole year I’ve run a weekly newsletter exploring the trends which are shaping the SaaS industry and collected many data points (the searchable database is available on saasdatapoints.com).
In this post I’m listing 7 major trends which I think will continue to define the SaaS landscape in the year to come.
There are two main ways for SaaS startups to approach the B2B software market:
The maturity of the different SaaS categories in these different industries is not the same and the maturation process is not developing at the same pace everywhere.
Horizontal SaaS: for many categories the “education” phase is behind us and we’ve entered a new phase characterized by:
On the other hand the situation for many Vertical SaaS products is the same as what horizontal SaaS faced a couple of years ago (before it reached the the current level of maturity):
In 2016 these two macro trends will continue.
Horizontal SaaS: the product / sales / distribution playbooks that worked well the past years and which are very well documented on the internet are becoming less effective and need to be updated to take into account the changing landscape (ex: effectiveness of traditional inbound marketing which is going down or the emergence of new product paradigms).
Vertical SaaS: more and more industries will get “SaaS-ified (ex: the legal industry), the key is to copy what worked in other industries and to adapt the rest. Execution speed will be crucial.
Market maturity evolution:
Vertical Software market:
The SMB segment is also maturing:
In 2015 / 2014 what had started as enterprise chat clients, Slack and Hipchat, transitioned to platforms on which third party SaaS can now build products and interact with users.
Same with consumer messaging apps like Messenger or Whatsapp which are becoming interesting places to interact directly with end users (for customer support or conciergerie apps / smart assistants for example).
2016 will probably see the boom of third party tools and an increasing number of VC rounds to fuel them. That said it’s still uncertain how the messaging platform operators are going to deal with their ecosystem and there’s always a risk that they end up doing what Twitter or LinkedIn did (and kill their ecosystem). Slack seems to be heading the good direction with its dedicated fund though.
In 2015 Slack really took off in terms of active users. This platform cannot be ignored by many SaaS startups:
When it comes to mobile I like to distinguish mobile first companies and the others.
In 2015 most of the successful mobile first SaaS companies were either:
Apart from these two approaches it’s hard for ‘mobile first’ startups to come and compete on broader categories such as marketing, sales or support.
But in 2016 the game might change a bit. The transition of several messaging app to real platforms (Slack, Hipchat, Whatsapp, messenger, see above) might foster the birth of a new breed of mobile SaaS champions.
I’ve covered several interesting ones in the customer support space but I won’t be surprised to see more emerging in other categories (sales, marketing, finance…). Messaging platforms might be the catalyst that many startups needed on mobile.
For non “mobile first” SaaS, mobile experience (web or native apps) will, obviously, still grow in importance.
The mobile productivity category and vertical apps also dominate VC funding:
An interesting example of a successful “mobile first” company: Expensify (a quick calculation based on the public data they shared gave me an estimate of an ARR of $12M as of mid 2015, details here)
AI and bots were very hot topics in 2015 and it’s sometimes hard to distinguish the real potential behind the hype. The truth is that we’re hearing a lot about AI but the vast majority of so called “smart apps” are still not that smart.
My point of view is that, like with many things, there’s no revolution but evolution. Crazy smart AI in every software we use won’t happen overnight, many steps need to be completed before that, and I believe that in 2015 we’ve progressed well on education and infrastructure.
In 2016 we’ll probably witness the continuation of both trends. We still need more education and more easy to use / developer friendly APIs before AI really becomes ubiquitous (who will be the Stripe / Twilio / Algolia of AI and automation?).
In the meantime the really impressive apps will still come from the big players like Google, Facebook, Tesla… or research projects which have the resources to push the limits of this field.
Here are several landscapes covering AI and software bots. Keep an eye on the “infrastructure” layer this year.
By “Unbundling of SaaS” I’m referring to a new breed of startups which don’t offer traditional “full featured” SaaS products to their users but rather package their core service as an API and a suite of small tools. Let me take Clearbit as an example to illustrate this trend.
Clearbit is an API which enables you to enrich users / contacts data. The concept of enriching contact data is not new and is available in many traditional SaaS products such as sales, CRM or contact management tools.
But instead of offering “yet another traditional contact enrichment tool” Clearbit has packaged it as an API and a suite of addons (for Google Spreadsheet) to let users create their own experience. No need to provide UIs that users won’t use, Clearbit let them create their own UX tailored to their own needs.
I believe that it’s a really promising trend and that in 2016 we’ll see plenty of these services emerge in many categories (unbundling of support, sales / marketing, finance tools). This trend is mainly driven by:
The “API first” startups will go far beyond the classical API approach (usable only by developers through pure text code) and is probably the next step in the SaaS evolution.
With an increasingly mature SaaS market in terms of customer base, tech infrastructure and distribution channels, two trends seem to contradict each other: on one hand it’s getting harder to build a scalable business due to the increasing competition but on the other hands we’re seeing an increasing number of “micro SaaS businesses” emerge.
By micro SaaS businesses we mean businesses run by a limited team (very often solopreneur or max 2–3 person), bootstrapped, with revenue in the $1k — $20k MRR range and with no will to grow bigger with VC money. These products are very often either:
We’ll probably see plenty more in 2016.
To see what a micro SaaS business looks like from a metrics pov you can dig Storemapper dashboard. Tyler Tringas is also writing a very interesting eBook on the topic.
Here are the MRR and active customers evolution from 2012 to 2015.
More and more SaaS products integrate marketplace dynamics in their business model. And it doesn’t need to be huge horizontal marketplaces as this trend concerns a lot of of vertical / industry focused players.
Let’s take the example of “booking marketplaces”. These marketplaces enable users to book local services directly online (an appointment at the doctor, a sport court, an appointment at the hairdresser…) and at the same time provide the tools for businesses to manage and optimise these bookings. [Disclaimer, all of the examples given are Point Nine investments :-)]
Market and tech maturity are also the main drivers behind the emergence of more and more of these players and I think that this trend won’t stop in 2016, quite the opposite actually (and existing marketplace operators will also offer new SaaS features to their power sellers).

So, despite SaaS multiples and the public markets being at near-record highs, we’ve seen things start to … wobble a bit overall in tech:
Anyhow, it’s still the best of times. But they can’t go on forever.
Whatever this next downturn looks like, it won’t be the same as ’08-’09. Which was brutal. But we did learn some things from it that were somewhat counter to our expectations.
What we learned from ’08-’09 in SaaS:

The downturn won’t be fun. It took 2 years to bounce back, and 4–5 years to fully recover from the last one. But once we did, boy, it all got good.

At Point Nine, we’ve been fortunate enough to invest in about half a dozen companies building products that are intrinsically viral (or have a built-in growth mechanism in their product). From online surveys at Typeform in Barcelona in 2012, client-facing documents at Qwilr in Australia in 2016, and collaboration videos at Loom in the US in 2017 to more recent communication videos with Playplay in Paris, we’re big fans of these products (and companies).
The main reason is that these companies can leverage their products to keep growing at roughly the same MoM growth rate (i.e., grow exponentially) while not spending more on acquiring customers. In more financial terms, they leverage virality to maintain (or even reduce) acquisition costs while scaling.
How do they do that? They build a product with baked-in virality: users share a version of the product with non-users who then become users. The loop is closed. With traditional acquisition channels (e.g. SEO, SEM) saturating, viral SaaS companies (or companies with Product-Led Growth) benefit from an incredibly efficient way to grow because, unlike paid marketing, viral growth is free and compounding. More users will bring more exposure, which in turn will bring more users.
In this post, I want to go one level deeper in deconstructing a viral loop to explain a few techniques that we have observed in our portfolio to leverage virality in SaaS. The hope is that these techniques are as actionable as possible for anyone building a viral SaaS product.
Viral growth can be quantified with what’s called the k-factor, which is defined as: “how many new users a user brings to your product in a defined time period.” 1 user = k new users. The holy grail of such viral loops is to get to k > 1 because by then, you’re growing exponentially.
Want to see how powerful that is? Say you get to a k-factor of 1.1, i.e., 1 user brings 1.1 new users in each cycle.
Andrew Chen’s post here builds a quick mathematical model to understand viral growth if you’re interested. David Skok’s post there is also great.
Now if we go one level deeper into this loop, I like to think that we can decompose it into 3 steps:
And thus, k = Activation * Exposure/Contamination * Conversion
In the next parts, I’ll explain a few techniques to improve activation, exposure/contamination, and conversion.
Let’s define activation as “the key action that a new user needs to do to be deriving utility from your product.” For such viral products, most of the time it means for this user to expose your product to their audience: sending a Typeform survey to a recipient, sending a Loom video to a colleague or publishing a Playplay video to an audience.
As Joe, the CEO of Loom, explains in this podcast, fixing activation is the first thing to do when building a SaaS product as i) this shows how useful and intuitive your product is, and ii) it’s the first step toward growing virally.
Some techniques to improve it are:
For example, Loom managed to increase activation (activation being defined as “when a new Loom user gets a first Loom video viewed”) from 17% to 35% of any new Loom user between its Seed and its Series A. This basically means that for each cycle, twice as many users were successfully activated.
Now that new users are activated, let’s focus on the next step: exposing your product to as many users as possible.
Let’s define exposure/contamination as “the number of people exposed each activated user brings to your platform during a specific time period”. The bad news here is that this one is intrinsic to the use case and thus explains why every viral SaaS product/company is not made equal. On average, a Typeform will be sent to hundreds of recipients per month, a Qwilr will be sent to tens to hundreds of viewers per month, and a Playplay will be viewed by (tens of) thousands of viewers per month.
Now, while the exposure is highly dependent on the use case, there are a few techniques to improve the exposure:
Now that your product has been exposed to potential new users, your task is to convert them into users, which is the “Conversion” phase.
The great news here is that whatever product you’re working on, this can be significantly improved (as any landing page can be improved). It often consists of two steps (or two conversion rates): incentivizing people to create their own version of the product and converting them into new users.
Some techniques are:
Don’t get desperate, you can get closer to 1 than you think! Without getting into the exact numbers, working on each steps (activation, exposure, conversion), Typeform managed to multiply its k-factor by 4x in 2 years!
And for you, an investor who’s also thinking that viral growth is amazing, don’t forget that most steps can be improved but that not all use cases have the same exposure and thus not all viral SaaS companies are made equal ;)
That’s all, you can go back to your k-factors!
If you’re building a viral SaaS product and have discovered other amazing (product) growth techniques, get in touch via email, I’d love to learn more!
Beyond the work we’re doing with our portfolio companies, this blog post is heavily inspired by an awesome presentation that Pedro from Typeform did at one of the P9 Founder Summits some years ago and by Joe from Loom’s recent podcast. Thanks to my colleagues Clément, Rodrigo and Julia for reviewing early, full of typos, versions of this post.

Top highlight
In the first part of this series I shared the quantitative data that I collected in my recent survey among more than 60 SaaS investors. Today I’ll write about the answers to the survey’s free-form question:
“What are the top 3 things you’re looking for when you assess a potential SaaS investment?”
Despite the fact that the question was optional, almost everyone answered it and I got lots of great responses. I’ll start with a summary, followed by a number of selected quotes that I think are particularly useful.
The first thing I did was to dump all answers into a word cloud tool, which created this visualisation:
I think the algorithms did a remarkable job grouping related terms, removing stop words, and scaling each word in proportion to its importance. So I could stop here, because the word cloud contains pretty much all you have to know. :-)
I of course wanted to dig in deeper though, so I went through all comments and grouped them into major themes. The categorisation is, of course, a bit subjective, and I’m sure there are other (and maybe better) ways to do it. Based on the themes that I picked, here’s the result, sorted by count, i.e. by the number of respondents who mentioned the theme in their answer:
The clear winner is, not surprisingly, an excellent founding team, followed by a large TAM (Total Addressable Market), moat (i.e. defensibility), a great and highly differentiated product, a repeatable sales model, and a dollar retention rate of over 100%, i.e. negative ARR churn.
If we look at the breakdown by stage and the top comments for each stage, we can make a few interesting observations:
The quality of the team gets the highest number of votes from both seed and Series A investors. Seed investors also pointed out that they are looking for great products that solve a massive pain point and that the team should have a convincing go-to-market plan. As you move to the Series A stage, investors start to care more and more about repeatability, retention, and defensibility. At the Series B stage, dollar retention got one of the top votes.
While we got more than 70 comments from Series A investors, the sample sizes for seed and Series B are quite low, so those results need to be taken with a grain of salt. That said, the results make perfect sense to me: In the beginning, it’s all about the team and getting to Product/Market Fit. Over time, the focus shifts to a repeatable sales model and healthy unit economics, and eventually it’s all about defensibility and the size of the market.
What’s maybe surprising is that moat came in as the #2 theme among Series A investors. I’m not sure if moat would have been mentioned so frequently five years ago, but today most SaaS investors believe that being a workflow tool with a nice UI isn’t enough to create long-term defensibility – hence the focus on building moat, usually through some kind of data assets or network effects. Another surprise is maybe that product didn’t get more mentions from Series A investors, but the data doesn’t tell us if it’s because they don’t care so much about product or because they take a great product for granted (as in, if the company didn’t have a great product they wouldn’t have gotten this far).
This I thought was one of the best, thought-provoking comments from the survey, but there are many more. Here is a selection.
There were many great comments about what investors are looking for in the founding team. Here are some of the best ones:
“Some anecdotes or observed behavior that reflects a deep intensity and competitive personality, which comes across in how they react to and watch competition in the market. We really like conversations where the founder has a deep understanding of all the competitors (not just surface level trashtalking based on what they can gather publicly), educated by actual proprietary intel from their networks. It shows an ability to get information and convince people to be on their side.”
“Some type of specialized domain knowledge that leads to an unexpected and unconventional insight.”
“Speed (time it took to get where they currently are, time to make decisions)”
“Founders that are driven, expert, team-oriented and create a vision that others want to get behind.”
“Exceptional product centric founder”
“Hungry & talented teams that can grow into CEOs”
“Insiders to the pain / outsiders to the market”
“Mission driven founders”
“Management that can handle 20x the size of today”
“Thought leadership: great understanding of where the market is going and being able to share this to their clients/the market.”
I also liked this one on the “why now” question …
“A compelling “why now” argument that explains how multiple trends are converging at a specific point in time to make this business likely to succeed now (but not in the past). Factors could include impending regulatory change, dramatic changes in the price of some IT component that impacts the economics of downstream businesses, the proliferation of smartphones, etc.”
… and this one on competition:
“Fat incumbents”
Customer references are important for many investors …
“Super positive customer references. We try to introduce a few portfolio companies to get unbiased feedback on the product and quality of customer support.”
… as is a sticky product:
“Deep embedding in software stack or workflows”
Some good comments about product quality …
“Differentiation — 10X better than existing solutions in markets that are already proven”
“Customers who preach about the product”
“I’m trying to assess is why this is going to make a transformative difference for the user of the product and the organization it serves. Good revenue growth is worthless if the company gets huge adoption initially but doesn’t drive fundamental change.”
… and the need to address a massive pain point:
“Massive pain point in the market with identifiable customer that has the wallet to pay for it.”
“Products solving problems which people have but the market is not yet clear on.”
“Product that solves some ‘hair on fire’ pain.”
Interesting points regarding financeability and investor/company fit:
“Financeability — do we have a sense of which 5 firms could do the Series A for a seed opportunity, based on their typical interest and the fact that they have not invested in the space yet.”
“Proximity to our team so that we can be helpful.”
“Moat” was a huge topic, as mentioned above:
“Increasing defensibility as the company grows, typically leveraging proprietary data”
“Competitive moat, ideally via usage-driven proprietary data”
“Defensibility in the technology or business model. Using data to generate intelligence rather than simply managing processes.”
What investors say about repeatability in sales and sales efficiency:
“Consistency in reasons why customers buy”
“At least one scalable marketing channel”
“Evidence of repeatable sales model (vs. founder lead sales)”
“Less than 12 months CAC payback on a gross margin basis (18 months OK if lots of upsell and true enterprise SaaS)”
Last but not least, an interesting comment on valuation:
“Size vs. Growth Rate vs. TAM vs. Post-Money = opportunity to make 5x+”
That leaves us with only one thing: putting all of this on the back of napkin. Stay tuned!
UPDATE: The 3rd part of this post and the napkin has been published.

This post was originally written by my buddy Ryan Shank and is a great piece on how he built his latest company from scratch. What I really love about it is how actionable it is. He not only tells you what he did but lays out exactly how he did it, how much everything cost him (time & money) and the steps you can take to build a software company yourself. He even shares all the docs and communication he had with freelancers along the way. Now here’s Ryan.
About 6 months ago I decided that I was going to build a SaaS company from scratch. I had recently sold my company and found myself in discussions with a number of startups around making angel investments. This didn’t get me too excited so I wanted to see if I could build and launch a SaaS company for the same amount of money that I would have otherwise angel invested into other companies.
My thought process was that if I could pull it off then I would own 100% of the company, and have full control of my own destiny, rather than simply cutting a check and owning less than 1% of the company.
My background is primarily concentrated on small businesses, selling products like leads and back office software. Over the past 6 years I’ve had thousands of conversations with small businesses discussing everything from how they operate to where they are spending money on marketing.
It was based on these conversations and the success of the Twilio IPO that I decided I was going to build call-tracking software.
Today I’m sharing the tactics I used to build and launch my Saas company, PhoneWagon. I also share all the documentation that I created during this process including email outreach scripts, user stories, product requirements doc, and other tools I used along the way. Here’s the steps I took to make it happen:
In my opinion, design and user experience (UX) is one of the most important aspects of SaaS. Good design will go a long way to not only convert customers but also help them engage with your product and ultimately retain.
To find a designer I used Dribbble. There are other similar sites out there like Carbonmade or Behance but I’ve used Dribbble in the past and felt more comfortable there.
You must be a paid member of the community to send a message to designers, which costs $20 for the year. After coughing up the twenty bucks (obviously worth it), I took about 6 hours one day and searched for designs that I loved.
I would search for things like “b2b dashboard”, “saas dashboard”, etc:
After browsing through hundreds of designers and portfolios, I narrowed down a list of my top 10. Since not all of them would be available to take on a new project, I decided I needed to contact them all in hopes that at least a couple of them would be able to work with me, then I would then pick my favorite.
I sent them all this entire message:
Of the 10 messages sent, I received 8 replies. One of the designers was not available for work (but replied anyway.. boom!) and 7 of them invited me to an exploratory call.
The designer that I ended up choosing does amazing work, has relevant experience, and totally understood what I was doing. I personally wanted someone who I could lean on as a thought partner rather than them just blindly doing everything I told them. From the initial phone and Skype conversations, I could tell that the designer I went with was the right guy for the job.
After thoroughly discussing requirements (more on that in a little), we landed on a fixed price for the project to be paid out at the completion of each deliverable.
Here is a cleaner view of the design deliverables:
I didn’t intend on spending this much money on design — however, I strongly believe that good design and a beautiful user experience will pay off exponentially in the long run through higher customer lifetime value due to increased retention.
I didn’t intend to spend this much money on design — however, I strongly believe that good design and a beautiful user experience will pay off exponentially in the long run.
I don’t like the phrase “product requirements”. It sounds very corporate and heavy. When I refer to product requirements, I’m referring to all the various documents that help tell the story about what the product is, how it works, and who will be using it.
First, I created a very basic product design overview document (here) and product features document (here). These were created to provide both a high level overview of the product and very specific features that the product must have in order to provide value.
Next, I typed up a real life example of why the product is needed and the problem that it’s solving.
Finally, I created another document that went over the pain points that we are solving for and the solution that we’re offering to those pain points.
My designer recommended that we create user stories as well. As Mountain Goat Software explains, user stories are part of an agile approach that helps shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them. All agile user stories include a written sentence or two and, more importantly, a series of conversations about the desired functionality.
Ours ended up looking like this:
(see the document here)
We also filled out a worksheet based on the Hook model, the four step process companies use to build consumer habits. If you aren’t familiar, Hooked is an amazing book by Nir Eyal about how to build habit-forming products.
(Download the worksheet here)
During this phase we created the following documents to help us define our product requirements:
Now that we had thoroughly defined the product, it was time to move on to the agreed upon deliverables from the designer.
My designer was very transparent and collaborative during the design phase. We would be in constant contact and talked on Skype throughout the day.
He would sometimes send me previews of wireframes and designs in Skype but would always throw them in a program like InVision afterwards to make sure everything is easily accessible.
The design process was very straightforward. We would spend a lot of time on wireframes because that’s where the customer experience and flow gets hashed out. This took quite a bit of time and a lot of back and forth thinking through various scenarios. After we nailed the wireframes, we moved on to design. My designer would send some designs along for feedback and I would comment on them until we landed on something we both agreed on.
During the design phase we used a number of tools for various functions like providing a preview of the current designs (InVision) to submitting an invoice for the completion of each deliverable milestone (FreshBooks).
Here’s a quick list of the tools we used:
The next step to building our SaaS product was, well, building it. Similar to how I searched for a designer on Dribbble, it was now time to search for a developer.
Before I began my search I needed to decide on a few things. First, I needed to decide if I was okay with using an offshore developer. Next, I needed to decide on the level of experience required. Finally, I needed to decide if I wanted a freelance developer or one that was working inside of a company.
While these aren’t exact, the ballpark hourly rates for different experience levels are below:
Due to cost I decided I wanted to hire a senior developer in India who was working inside of a company (not freelancing). That way I got access to project managers who would be holding them accountable.
To find the developer I was looking for I used Upwork, a website that connects clients with freelancers. I created a job post and detailed out what I was looking for.
I received 39 applications to my job post and interviewed 6 people. To decide who I would interview, I looked very carefully at 3 things:
The developer I ended up going with had over 9,000 hours completed through Upwork and 100% job success score, meaning that 100% of his jobs resulted in a great client experience. These are numbers that the freelancers cannot manipulate so they are taken very seriously. In addition to our conversations, these things made me feel comfortable hiring him.
Building a software product from the ground up is challenging. There are a number of things to do that include setting up the project architecture, creating the database with schemas, tables, and triggers, setting up webhooks for API calls, creating login credential validation, and so much more.
My developer gave me a rough estimate on the number of hours it would take to complete these various stages and updates me every 4 weeks on the status of our milestones.
He also sends me daily email updates so I know exactly what he’s working on each day.
We are also in constant communication at nearly all hours of the day. My developer is also a thought partner — he is coming up with scenarios that I’m not thinking of and providing very valuable product recommendations. This is incredibly valuable.
After about 6 months and over 850 hours, we were finally able to get a product shipped.
Now that I had a working product, it was time to begin selling it. Now of course there’s a ton of content out there that goes over SaaS marketing and sales. I’m not going to dive into it too deep but rather give you an overview of what I did to begin selling my product.
To start, I registered a domain using GoDaddy, used WPEngine to host my site, setup branded emails with Google Apps, and then threw up a WordPress landing page.
To get my WordPress landing page designed and implemented, I posted a job on Upwork.
I paid $150 for this to be done and it took them about 2 days. The guy I used for this used the WordPress theme Divi, which is a powerful theme that makes it easy to build WordPress sites with their visual builder (so you don’t need to know how to code).
After the landing page was up, I ran some basic Facebook ads to drive traffic to the site. From there I would call every single person that submitted their information through my form.
I created various phone scripts to document what was working and what wasn’t. I was able to get a couple paying customers using this method. I would create their account on the backend and charge them manually in Stripe. Then I would send them the URL of our software application along with their username and password.
My first customers loved that they were early adopters and able to contribute valuable feedback that would shape the product in the future.
Here’s a cool email I got from one of my first few customers:
All in all, I spent just under $40k building my SaaS product:
I’m confident that if you use this approach you can also build a SaaS product for under $40k. This is a great alternative to raising a ton of money and diluting yourself and your future employees.
It isn’t going to be easy. It will require a lot of focus and effort. But if are able to follow this outline and find a talented developer and designer, you will be able to get your SaaS company off the ground. You don’t need a ton of cash or to raise venture capital to do this.
I hope this post inspires you to build and launch a SaaS company that people love.

Founders often ask me questions like:
These are just three examples. What they show is that founders are keen to find out how their business is performing relative to their peers. This makes sense. Comparing various aspects of your business with those of other companies can help you find out the biggest areas for improvement.
If you know, for example, that your conversion rate is sub-par, it’ll be worth your time to understand why and how to improve. If your conversion rate is best in class, on the other hand, rather than trying to squeeze the last fraction of a percent out of your conversion funnel, you’ll probably want to focus on improving other areas of your business.
The challenge is that no single metric is very meaningful if considered in isolation, which is why my answer to these questions usually starts with “it depends”.
For example:
Many of these variables are interconnected, so you always have to look at the entire picture. In some cases, two lower-level variables can act together to impact a higher-level variable. For example, if you’re a self-service SaaS company, your visitor-to-trial signup rate multiplied by your trial-to-paid conversion rate determines your total conversion rate from website visitors to paid customers, which is what ultimately matters.
In some of these cases, the two drivers ‘compete’: If you manage to increase your visitor-to-trial conversion rate, your trial-to-paid conversion might deteriorate because you get a larger number of less qualified trials.
What this simple chart illustrates is that a lower trial-to-paid conversion rate is acceptable if you have a higher visitor-to-trial conversion rate, and vice versa.
OK, so it’s hard to say what an acceptable trial-to-paid conversion is without looking at your visitor-to-trial conversion and your total funnel conversion rate. But what, then, is an acceptable total conversion rate? Well, that also depends!
It depends, for example, on:
If you think this is a case of turtles all the way down, fear not. In the end it all comes down to LTV/CAC, which is why this is one of my favorite charts:
What you can see here is that if you have a high LTV (AKA you’re going after elephants or whales), you can afford high CACs. If you have a low LTV (AKA you’re selling to mice or rabbits) you better have low CACs — or you’ll end up in the graveyard quadrant of the chart. If you find yourself in that quadrant you’ll have to decrease your CACs and/or increase your LTV in order to get to the habitable zone of the chart.
There may be reasons to temporarily accept a lower LTV/CAC ratio, e.g. if you’re spending aggressively to get market share. And before you have strong Product/Market Fit you shouldn’t worry about LTV/CAC because it’s all about learning and getting to PMF.
But ultimately SaaS businesses make money by monetizing customers, over their lifetime, at a multiple of what it cost to acquire them. So you’ll have to make your LTV/CAC ratio work.
In conclusion, here are a few tips:
1) If you’re trying to find out what churn rate [or conversion rate or ARPA or … ] is acceptable for your business, start from LTV/CAC and work backwards from there.
2) As a rule of thumb, a good LTV/CAC ratio is 4. There’s no science behind that number, but if your LTV/CAC ratio is 4 it means that after spending 1x your CAC on CAC (duh) and 1–2x on G&A and R&D you have 1–2x to cover the costs of capital and generate profits, with some margin for error.
3) Keep in mind that your LTV for current or future customers is always an estimate based on the behavior of past customers. You won’t be able to measure your CAC with 100% precision, either, because of various kinds of tracking errors and attribution uncertainties. Therefore you have to work with simplifications, conservative assumptions and leave a large buffer for error.
The simple chart above showed that if you’re aiming for a 4% total conversion rate, you’ll have to land somewhere on or above the green curve. Similarly, you can imagine a 3-dimensional space with ARPA, churn rate, and CAC as the axes. Somewhere in that space is a body that represents a CAC/LTV ratio of 4 or higher. We can call that the Goldilocks Zone of SaaS Metrics¹⁾.
Now go find your place in that zone!
PS: If you read this post hoping to get a precise answer to the question “What’s an OK churn rate?”, I’m sorry. 😉 As a small consolation prize, here’s a somewhat older piece about SaaS metrics with churn benchmarking data from 1500 SaaS companies.
¹⁾ One might argue that the Goldilocks zone isn’t a good analogy because for a region in space to be habitable it can’t be too hot or too cold, while in the case of LTV/CAC, there is no “too high”. That may be true, but then again, if your LTV/CAC ratio is 20 it means that you’re not spending enough on customer acquisition.
Thank you, Nathan Benaich and Stefan Smalla, for reviewing a draft of this post and your valuable feedback!

I apologize for my long-quiet. I stealthily moved to NYC (surprise!) and have been heads down for some time building “the new thing.”
Return co-founder Ariel Diaz & I uncovered an opportunity, raised a round from superlative investors (juicy details below), assembled the team, and built a product. So, what’s the thing?
The whole of modern work is moving to the cloud, moving to thousands of individual apps & services forming different nodes in the great internet-brain that lets us do that work better, faster, and with less frustration.
This is the era of SaaS.
Now, every individual in your organization is a decision maker, from how they do their job, and to an increasing extent, the tools they choose to do it. The consumerization of IT is not just phones & laptop; it’s individuals discovering, adopting, and leveraging best-of-breed tools marketed to them, their department, their niche, and even themselves.
This is fantastic! Yes!
This has elements of fresh hell! Also yes!
Trading the integrated cathedral of traditional IT, for the bottoms-up bazaar of loosely-coupled SaaS, brings a whole new set of concerns:
As if we didn’t have enough things to track & sift through instead of doing what we should be doing.
This trend isn’t abating, it’s accelerating, and that got us thinking. Could we automate the mundane, humanize the complex, and proactively deliver insight?
We think so; therefore we built Blissfully.com
Blissfully installs in under a minute, immediately showing you all the SaaS products your company uses, pays for, and stores data in.
First, Blissfully provides awareness (and a pun, all good companies involve puns, amirite Stewart Butterfield?)
In the minute after installation, you won’t be worrying about the big picture. It’s there for you, keeping itself up to date, forever. Here’s what you’re using, what you’re paying, and this is who’s involved. Sorted.
Now that manual vendor tracking is out of the way, let the automation begin!
Are you wasting money on tools for employees who are no longer even there? Have too many relationships with the same vendor? Could save money by changing plans? Need intel on negotiating better? Wish invoice receipts were “magnetized” to a single place? Need help understanding what all these vendors are? Tada! We’ve got all that.
And what about your company’s data exposure all over the web? Blissfully helps aggregate & navigate, proactively pushing critical information to the right people when the need arises. Blissfully strives to be reserved, self-assuredly, proactively-helpful.
Because our big-big-vision is simple: If you had someone who knew your organization’s tooling inside & out, knew all the products in the world inside & out, and proactively helped people throughout your org do even better, that’d be pretty special.
That’s what we’re doing — we’re building & automating that kind of insight & intelligence.
Our hands are full, we’ve got lots to do, and we find this so, so exciting. I hope you find it exciting, too. And if you do, Blissfully accepts applications to join our early access: http://www.blissfully.com
I’m thrilled to be building Blissfully with incredibly smart, hard working people.
First, my co-founder Ariel Diaz, with whom I started Boundless.com years ago. We’ve grayed (read: learned) more, collected fresh chips on our shoulders, and working to make fetch a thing, come hell or high water.
Second, our early development team is fantastically capable.
Third, we’ve assembled a who’s who of high-energy, high-acumen founder-investors & founder-angels.
Eric Paley, partner Founder Collective, returns to work with Ariel & me for a second time around, leading the round. I wouldn’t “board-room” without him.
And we’re lucky to have assembled a group of angels that would make any dinner party truly stellar:
Collectively, we catalyzed for Blissfully’s $1.5MM seed round, to earnestly begin building. We’re head-quartered in NYC, with an office in BOS.
We’re ready to rock, and we’ve got lots to do.
(And we’re looking for those who want to help us do it)

Top highlight
At Palantir, our approach to software has undergone a radical transformation in the past few years. When we first launched Gotham in 2008, cloud computing was in its infancy, and most enterprise software was still installed on customer-owned hardware. This was especially true in the large governmental organizations that used Gotham, where our software ran on-premises and upgrades were relatively infrequent and manual.
Government and Enterprise use Foundry on public cloud for mission critical operations.
When we built Foundry in 2016, the software world looked a lot different, so instead of replicating what we did with Gotham, we took a new approach: we built Foundry as a cloud-native SaaS with a microservice architecture. Our customers embraced the SaaS model much faster than we expected, and it has since come to dominate our business. In the past two years, every new Commercial customer has opted for our SaaS platform. And the same can be said for the US Government, where since receiving FedRAMP Moderate and DoD IL-5 authorization — the highest SaaS authorization, used for Mission-Critical and National Security Systems — our public-cloud SaaS has been used by nearly all new customers for their unclassified work.
However, what makes our two user-facing SaaS platforms — Gotham and Foundry — truly unique is what is under the hood. Both of these platforms stand on the shoulders of a continuous delivery system we call Palantir Apollo. Apollo has been so critical to our success, we consider it to be our third platform. It not only unlocked our transformation to SaaS platforms, but has allowed us to go beyond just SaaS. With Apollo, our SaaS platforms run seamlessly in places where no SaaS has gone before.
Most enterprise SaaS companies only run in the public cloud, and often only use a single cloud provider. But this wasn’t enough for our customers. Some of our government customers require their software to run in purpose-built government or classified clouds that live separately from standard public cloud infrastructure. Others need to use our software in extreme disconnected environments, from submarines to drones. We asked ourselves, how do we build a SaaS that works for all of our customers? That’s where Apollo comes in.
In the past, we’ve written about the value of Apollo for our developers. In this post, we’ll discuss the value of Apollo for our customers.
Palantir Apollo is a continuous delivery system that powers our software platforms. Apollo was conceived alongside Foundry, initially built as the automation and delivery infrastructure for our public-cloud SaaS. However, given our roots in classified and on-prem environments, we knew that a traditional SaaS based on a single public cloud provider wouldn’t work everywhere. We needed unified tooling to bring the same SaaS platform to all of our customers, regardless of environment constraints. So we built Apollo to run as its own standalone platform — independent, decoupled from Foundry, running as a layer that sits between our applications and the underlying infrastructure.
Today, Apollo brings the same SaaS-style management to all of our platforms. It runs nearly everywhere that our software is deployed — cloud, on-prem, and classified networks — and has transformed the way that our software scales. Apollo orchestrates updates across heterogeneous deployment targets, unlocking fleet-wide autonomous management that has been a step-change in the efficiency of our operations.
Apollo manages and safely deploys our Gotham and Foundry platforms. Each platform is made up of hundreds of individual services, each owned by a development team that writes and releases product features independently. This approach allows us to roll out updates across services asynchronously, increasing feature velocity. However, this type of microservice architecture traditionally makes the deployment of the software more complex. Apollo is the brain that automates this complexity away. It is configured to decide what to upgrade, when to do it, and how. It monitors developer releases, resolves dependencies, and deploys new versions.
Apollo does this automatically in a way that obviates the need for user downtime or human intervention. It performs safe deploys with staged blue-green upgrades, and observes the roll-out process. If it notices an emergent issue, it begins a roll-back process, notifies the relevant development team, and avoids an outage. If successful, it moves on to the next service, and repeats — continuously delivering incremental, automatic updates for the fleet over 41,000 times a week.
Apollo performs this same automation for not just our SaaS, but also connected on-premises appliances, removing operating environment as a constraint. In fact, that’s one of the main reasons we built it. From Day 1, we’ve worked with customers in the most secure and highly regulated industries, operated in the world’s most logistically challenging environments, and built software capable of handling our customer’s most sensitive data. The experience of solving for the most technically challenging environment first, rather than adding it on later, is what led us to build Apollo as a foundation for software that can be written once and run anywhere.
Apollo has allowed us to extend our platforms across cloud regions to meet our customers’ data residency requirements, and across cloud providers to run a multi-cloud SaaS. It has allowed us to extend our platforms on-premises to connected hardware appliances and edge devices. And it has done so without adding significant overhead or requiring specialized workflows: our software developers write code, Apollo deploys it, and our centralized operations team can monitor the whole fleet from a single pane of glass. In other words, Apollo has enabled Palantir to bring our SaaS — and the SaaS economics that come with it — to environments where no SaaS has gone before.
At Palantir, we don’t take any software deployment scenario for granted. Our software engineers don’t know if their products will be deployed as part of our standard SaaS platform, serving web-scale traffic from the public cloud, or in Afghanistan, running on a ruggedized server rack in the back of a Humvee. Because Apollo removes the environment as a constraint, engineers can focus on velocity and application code. They write code once that works for all customers. This is in stark contrast to other software companies, where engineers write code that targets a specific environment and must engineer specialized products for each new deployment scenario they face. Ultimately, this approach brings more capabilities to our customers, faster.
This technology brings our SaaS and all its benefits to organizations who have never used SaaS before. Not only can we fully embrace modern development practices like devops, continuous delivery, containerization, auto-scaling, and automated upgrades — the core components of a SaaS solution — but we do so without traditional constraints of only supporting a single public cloud provider. We run our software in a homogenous way across heterogeneous environments, powered by Apollo. Apollo is the platform that makes it possible to bring a unified SaaS to our entire customer base.

This post is part of our series covering the SaaS industry. Subscribe to our Medium channel to be kept informed of our next posts.
Churn is probably one of the most documented SaaS metrics. The aim of this article is not to define and speak about the general concept of churn (you can find plenty of outstanding resources about that) but to analyse 4 SaaS benchmarks and see what they say about real churn figures.
The 4 benchmarks we’ll analyse are: Pacific Crest Survey, Open startups, Totango annual SaaS metrics report and Groove SaaS small business survey (if you know more of them please => @clemnt)
But before digging into the actual numbers I would like to stress on a very important point: before you compare churn numbers you have to clearly define which churn you’re talking about.
When you see a churn figure you have to ask yourself whether:
Revenue or user: pretty straightforward, in one case you measure the revenue lost from a cohort during a specific time range and in the other the number of paying customers lost from a cohort during that period of time.
Annual or monthly : meaning the churn is measured for a year or a month period. Since both are very often used here is a table with monthly churn and its annualised equivalent. I just use the formula: Annual Churn = 1 — ( 1 — monthly churn )^12.
Be careful though as you shouldn’t mix monthly plans churn with annual plans churn (different beasts).
Gross or Net churn: probably the trickiest of the 3. Gross revenue churn doesn’t take into account revenue expansion (= some users of your cohort can actually end up paying more at the end than at the beginning of the period considered, because they have upgraded their account) while net churn does.
So it’s totally possible to have a 6% monthly gross churn and a 2% monthly net churn. So if you see a 2% revenue churn alone, without context, it’s hard to compare it with other figures. Here is a good post on Chartmogul explaining it. And yes with net churn it’s possible to have a negative churn rate.
Now that we’ve made that clear let’s start.
The “general observations about customer account churn rates by segment” that Tomasz Tunguz shared are confirmed by ¾ of the benchmarks analysed. We cannot draw any meaningful conclusion from Totango survey, hence the ¾.
Couple of comments after receiving some messages / DM on Twitter:
About this benchmark
Conducted by David Skok and Matrix Partners the Pacific Crest Survey is the most complete and detailed benchmark in the SaaS industry. You won’t find better than this currently (available publicly at least). A must read.
Survey participants
The benchmark is based on the answers from 306 companies:
So we’re speaking mostly about companies selling software to the enterprise and mid-market segments here and probably fewer to SMBs customers (especially that in the results underneath the companies with less than $2.5M of revenue are excluded).
Results
The 2 graphs above are very interesting to get a bit more details:
Churn figures:
Knowing that:
We can infer that these churn results are representative of SaaS companies targeting mid-size / enterprise customers with generally sales / inside sales
About this benchmark
I’ve basically collected the churn data from the “open” SaaS companies (except Outreach Signals which is more an online agency than a SaaS).
Benchmark Participants
These are mainly SaaS targeting SMBs, with a much lower price point, ACV and also more early stage companies compared to the Pacific Crest survey ones.
Results
We can also notice that revenue churn is higher than customer churn for these companies, it’s the opposite for the Pacific Crest Survey ones.
Conclusion
These numbers are interesting because they confirm that at early stage and for a lower price point, SaaS companies tend to have higher churn rates (user and revenue) compared to Enterprise — mid market ones. Which was expected.
About this benchmark
Totango is a customer success software (one of their aim is to lower churn) which runs every year a survey among SaaS companies to benchmark several metrics.
Survey Participants
“500 SaaS professionals” which revenue distribution looks like this:
60% of participants have an ARR < 10M.
Results
A first problem is that the survey doesn’t say clearly whether we’re talking about gross or net revenue churn. Since they don’t have negative churn on the graph I infer that it’s gross churn.
So basically:
Conclusion
We have unfortunately not enough information about the precise profile of these companies or the distribution of churn by ACV to draw real conclusions.
About this benchmark
In 2013 Groove, a customer support software, run a survey to benchmark several SaaS metrics among small business saas.
Survey participants
“712 respondents who have reached Product/Market Fit, have been in business for at least 6 months and have at least $1,000 (but less than $500K) in monthly recurring revenue.”
Results
Again the problem is that Groove doesn’t precise which churn they talk about (revenue, net, gross or user churn). Especially that in their survey the question asked was quite open “What is your churn rate?”.
That being said we can infer that it’s monthly user churn (from the context).
Conclusion
The participants of this survey are very similar to the ones from the open startup (around the same ACV and MRR) with a lower monthly user churn though, 3.3%, compared to the 5.4% of the open startups.
But again we can only assume that it’s user churn and we don’t really know the methodology used by each company to calculate their churn. So these results should be taken cautiously.
Tomasz Tunguz shared a table that shows his “general observations about customer account churn rates by segment”
This is also what I regularly see among SaaS startups, so let’s compare that to our 4 benchmarks.
Pacific Crest Survey:
That’s in line with the 0.5–1% monthly and 6% — 10% customer churn from the table above.
Open Startups
That’s in line with the 3–7% monthly and 31% — 58% customer churn from the table above.
Totango
We cannot draw meaningful conclusion here.
Groove Survey
Big warning as we don’t have enough context and info on what and how the churn rate was calculated. If we pretend it’s coherent and concerns monthly user churn then:
That’s in line with the 3–7% monthly and 31% — 58% customer churn from the table above.
So if you are a pre- P/M fit and early stage startup (less than 1-2 years with paying customers):
If you have reached P/M fit and that you are running your business for more than 2 years and:

Top highlight
If you’re in SaaS, you can’t help but hear about HubSpot’s massive growth.
They have a traffic rank of #5 in the world… in the online marketing tech space.
This doesn’t include websites they’ve built to build their community and fill the top of their sales funnel.
They are a major player in the SMB SaaS market.
It is my hope in this article to show you what’s truly working online in SaaS by giving you a glimpse into the strategies and tactics of one of the SaaS industries biggest players.
What you see below is not conjecture or theory. This is the real facts behind a major SaaS company, the marketing strategies they use, and the tactics used.
HubSpot was founded in 2006 by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah. In 8 years they grew from zero to $100M+ revenue, with an IPO in 2014.
Perhaps best known for their inbound marketing prowess, HubSpot’s rocketship growth trajectory makes them the second fastest SMB SaaS company to ever IPO.
Both Brian and Dharmesh had successful backgrounds in tech before launching HubSpot. Brian was VP of Sales at Groove Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft, and Dharmesh was founder and CEO of Pyramid Digital Solutions, which was acquired by SunGuard Data Systems.
In 2009, Brian and Dharmesh co-authored a book called “Inbound Marketing: Get Found Using Google, Social Media and Blogs”.
Lastly, Brian and Dharmesh were named in the Inc. Founders 40 in 2016.
While they have about a dozen sites over the years, it appears that there are 4 critical websites key to HubSpot’s online marketing strategy.
The bulk of their traffic is from inbound marketing, primarily through organic search. However, they are are also spending money on paid search ads. Their blog post CTAs and ads are driven to landing pages with a very basic level visual design, short form copy and a full lead form.
On their landing pages they offer hundreds of different lead gen incentives (to match their blog article content and the searcher’s intent) in exchange for a full lead. Beyond the lead they sell inbound marketing software for a subscription fee based on their customers number of CRM contacts.
This is their public facing main site. It gets an enormous amount of organic (earned) traffic from the search engines. HubSpot put A LOT of focus on content marketing and SEO.
The reason I say that is when I look at the keywords they are ranking for and which ones are sending them the most traffic, they have thousands of generic key phrases like “Website Leads” and “Grow Email List” ranking on the first page of Google.
From analyzing HubSpot’s 69,087 organic keywords I could count 5,905 that rank on the first page of Google and 10,440 that rank on the first page of Bing/Yahoo!.
They are also spending a moderate amount of money each month on paid search ads. When I investigated their paid search ad strategy it was primarily advertising their Free CRM, which has a core feature set of the main product, and leads SMBs to upgrading to their paid version once they experience HubSpot’s value and want to use the full feature set.
There is a lot of valuable content accessible from the HubSpot website which I believe is contributing to their low bounce rate and high time on site.
Inbound.org is an online hub for marketers to connect, learn and find jobs. It is funded by HubSpot Labs, an R&D department within HubSpot.
This site is primarily driven by high direct traffic from their main site, the 200,000+ community members who go straight to the site to login, organic search and 90%+ of social traffic from Facebook.
One of HubSpot’s largest revenue generators is channel sales. Just like Xero leverage accounting partners to grow their business, Hubspot’s marketing agency partners account for 40% of their revenue (as of their last earnings call).
Inbound.org is the perfect community for HubSpot to stay engaged with current marketing agency partners, educate them on the latest marketing trends, help them find new employees, get real-time feedback on their products and attract new potential partners into their ecosystem.
They have 3,400+ partners servicing thousands of HubSpot customers, helping them get better results, month in and month out. HubSpot’s partner program for marketing agencies recently scaled up past $100M in annual revenue.
HubSpot’s free Website Grader tool was the first ever project to come out of HubSpot Labs in 2007. A person enters their website URL and email address to see how strong their website is out of 100.
They then get recommendations on what they need to improve when it comes to:
Aside from being a super helpful tool for small business owners, it is also a great example of how to build a free tool to drive millions of market specific TOFU (top-of-funnel) leads to your SaaS company.
Dharmesh posted on Inbound.org about how significant the tool has been to HubSpot’s success…
A simple little tool that helped millions of people improve their websites — and in the process, helped HubSpot become a publicly-traded company [NYSE:HUBS] with over 15,000 customers and a market value of over $1.6 billion.
— Dharmesh Shah
The majority of website traffic for the tool comes from the HubSpot blog, suggesting that blog content combined with a strong market specific lead magnet can be a great combination to acquire TOFU leads at scale.
Since their success with Website Grader, HubSpot have got ultra-granular with their TOFU lead generation. They now create blog posts with blog post specific lead magnets on their main website to fill the top of their sales funnel with thousands of leads every month.
ThinkGrowth.org is a HubSpot Medium Publication that was launched on April 17, 2015. It was first branded as ReadThink.com, then re-branded to ThinkGrowth.org on Dec 14, 2016.
Here is what Janessa Lantz, Principal Content Marketing Strategist at HubSpot said about what their Medium publication represents:
ThinkGrowth.org reflects a commitment to thinking deeper — asking questions, poking holes in the easy answer, and exploring past the first page of Google’s search results. It’s also a commitment to finding the right questions, the kind that will move your career and business forward.
— Janessa Lantz
HubSpot’s launch on Medium was based on this premise: more and more people are consuming articles directly from platforms like Medium, Facebook, and podcasts so they want to be where their readers are.
Early posts were mostly cross-published content from the HubSpot blog, but HubSpot quickly realised that their “optimized for search” blog content wasn’t generating many views on Medium.
They had the best success by finding writers on the rise on Medium like Seth Godin, Nir Eyal, Larry Kim, steve blank and Danielle Morrill and syndicating content they had created — exposing both them and HubSpot to a new audience.
By “optimizing for people” with opinion pieces, personal accounts and reaction posts from top writers and influencers, HubSpot found content that would often have a stronger performance than their home blog.
Not only did HubSpot breakthrough the “Plateau of Despair” and grow well beyond 160,000 views per month, but their Medium publication is now the 18th largest publication on Medium:
Since their success on Medium, HubSpot have decided to invest in a brand new team focused entirely on “offsite” content strategy which is being headed up by Meghan Keaney Anderson, Sam Mallikarjunan and Janessa Lantz.
They have over 150 guest writers and take guest submissions at medium@hubspot.com
Notice that some of their blog posts aren’t the type you’d typically see on a website that sells inbound marketing software.
Their most shared post generate leads for their HR department to fill their product management jobs pipeline (high-growth companies need to hire!):
The second most shared is an opt-in page for a free guide on “How To Use Excel”:
You may be thinking… why in the heck are HubSpot teaching people how to use excel?
Trust me… this isn’t a mistake.
The smart team over at HubSpot did their research and found that there are 27,000+ people every month searching for “how to use excel”.
When you search for “how to use excel” on Google, the first organic search result to pop up is a HubSpot blog post titled “How to Use Excel: 14 Simple Excel Shortcuts, Tips & Tricks”.
And guess how they are using that blog post to generate leads?
In the blog post they have 3 CTA’s that link to their “How To Use Excel” guide:
If you take a look through HubSpot’s blog, you will see that these 3 blog post CTA’s are consistent across most of HubSpot’s blog posts.
Sometimes they all go to the same lead magnet (like in the example above). Other times, all 3 CTA’s will go to 3 different landing pages with 3 different lead assets relevant to that blog post.
HubSpot has thousands of these “owned media” lead assets, with their own dedicated landing pages.
Here is an example of 5 blog posts and lead assets from HubSpot’s Marketing Blog that they are using to fill the top of their funnel:
As you can see… HubSpot are an inbound content AND lead generating machine!
One thing HubSpot do really well, is update old blog posts to make them relevant again today with an Editor’s Note at the top of post to let people know what has been updated.
Here is an example:
This is a great strategy to generate more leads from old, evergreen content pieces.
They have 587 PPC keywords that they are bidding on, but almost all of their ads were a version of the above.
Here is what their entire paid search funnel looks like for their Free CRM offer:
There were a couple of other ads like one with the headline “Free Lead Generation Tool - Start Capturing Leads Today” which were spot targeted ads for a free version of their HubSpot Marketing product.
However, their 3 main active paid search funnels are below and drive traffic to these 3 landing pages:
This is a very mature account and the most recent data in the tool doesn’t represent where they started.
When I look back over the years I can see that HubSpot have tested many different offers including:
They have now pruned all but the most profitable keywords and segments over the years and found the best offers that convert for the highest buy-intent keywords in their market. Either that or they are grossly under-utilizing one of the best ad platforms on the Internet (not likely).
This is the above-the-fold section of their Free CRM landing page. It’s important to note that if anyone comes to this page, they can make a quick decision from the info provided in this first section.
Their “Get Started” CTA button leads the visitor to a half lead (email, company name, website URL) form after clicking through.
Everything they need to convert their user is in this section…
If people want more information before making a decision, they can scroll down and read these 4 points:
6. The market for CRM software is fiercely competitive. HubSpot know this, so they talk about their key USPs here (like powerful data enrichment functionality, adding leads from your inbox and one customer view) to help people understand if this CRM will be the right fit for them
7. Introducing benefits like ‘10-second installation’ and ‘100% Free’ help to overcome objections people usually have with a product like this
Now people know how HubSpot’s CRM is different from others and the benefits it provides in the 4 points above, they let people know it is just 3 simple steps to get started in the next section:
8. Adding a screenshot from inside the software helps people understand what they are going to see when they use the product
Then to round out the page, they have one final CTA:
9. It’s been proven over and over again that headshot’s with short text testimonials right above or below CTA buttons and lead forms increase conversions — use them
If you are in the same market as HubSpot, you certainly have your work cut out for you. However, I hope this brief has helped you to see what areas they are strong in and where they might be weak.
If you are not in the market you should be thinking about how you can apply what they are doing to YOUR SaaS, in YOUR market.
You should not be thinking my SaaS is different so none of this applies. Trust me after having worked with numerous SaaS companies — no SaaS is that different. These strategies work in all SaaS markets.
Also, take notice as to what is not here. The strategies they are and aren’t using is important to identify.
What strategies and tactics are not showing up here that some experts say you MUST be doing. I find it much more effective to learn from what’s actually in play and working with the biggest players, than trying to guess.
Double-down on what works. Ignore everything else. It is just a distraction.

Existing customers are where successful SaaS companies make money, which makes reducing churn the key to sustainability, growth, and — what we all want — swimming in money like Scrooge McDuck.
But in today’s highly competitive market, you’ll need more than a lucky dime (or even a really great product) to prove your ongoing worth to your current customers. You need some serious SaaS retention hacks.
Let’s take three things as given:
Stop Churn Lesson 1: Listen to the signals your customers are giving you
A good animal trainer knows that before an animal misbehaves, it will give a cue. Whether that’s the cock of an ear or the swish of a tail, there’s always a sign. And, if you catch that sign in time, you can prevent the behavior. People are no different. When someone disengages with your product, there are signs, and you can track them.
If you’re not sure what to track in the beginning, look for gaps in activity, or if you have something like an e-mail marketing service, see if anyone is downloading their list of contacts. You may even want to have an exit survey. Once you know which behaviors indicate imminent departure, you can start to construct a plan.
Stop Churn Lesson 2: Easy Fixes
Don’t let credit cards expire. Don’t let credit cards expire! It’s really simple and it’s easy money. The only trick is to find a billing system that provides a credit card updater service, which will automatically let users know when their cards are about to expire.
Stop Churn Lesson 3: Learn Why They Came in the First Place
Conducting an onboarding survey, when clients are just signing up, can give you invaluable insights into what your clients are hoping to find and expecting to get. It doesn’t have to be a survey in the Survey Monkey sense — having questions as part of your onboarding drip is an awesome trick of itself. You can use this information to drive your Customer Success initiatives and increase engagement. To help your clients use your product successfully, you have to understand what success means to them. Entrance surveys will also tell you whether you’re setting yourself up to over-promise and under-deliver.
Stop Churn Lesson 4: Stay on their Radar
Whether they’re in your app or on their Facebook page, you should have a presence on their desktop, smartphone and tablet. But, you have to do it the right way. With strong content marketing that provides value and interest, combined with responsive, fun and friendly social media staff, you can continue to develop relationships (read: engagement) with your clients all day, every day.
Don’t be afraid to interact with them. Joke with them. Answer their questions. Offer tips. Sharing your helpful blog posts is just the tip of the iceberg! Most importantly, become your clients’ friends. Friends don’t leave friends for cheaper friends — you know what I mean?
Stop Churn Lesson 5: Partner Up
Developing partnerships with complimentary services is a great way to expand your reach, increase your usefulness, and make it more difficult for people to leave. You can either join an established group or form your own by inviting companies to build add-ons and integrations for your product.
I’m going to let my Geek flag fly high for a moment and cite the Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim. By opening up Skyrim to amateur and professional mods, they continue to add interest and value even if you’ve beaten the game five times already. They’ve partnered with their users and that game may outlive us all.
Well, so far I’ve cited Scrooge McDuck and Skyrim, so I’m going to quit while I’m ahead and just say this: When your customers can unsubscribe any time, you have to keep providing compelling reasons to stay. Customer Success and churn reduction are two sides of the same coin — or even, one might say, the same Number One Dime…
I’m available for a limited number of SaaS consulting retainers, writing engagements, and I offer Twitter curation + growth (500–1,000 or more followers / mo.) with an authentic approach so that your feed doesn’t look like everyone else’s.

So, Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $25.6 billion dollars. That headline shocked all of us the other day. But if you step back, it’s not that impressive, the raw number itself.
After all, as a public company, LinkedIn was worth $32 billion just a few months earlier, and had been on one heck of a run through the end of 2015:
Viewed this way, $25.6 billion isn’t really all that exciting. Because it’s not like LinkedIn was some private company before that, like WhatsApp. That $20 billion acquisition (by the time of closing) was just as shocking, but we didn’t already have years of public company market cap to compare it to.
So why does it matter? Because the $25,600,000,000 was in cold, hard cash.
It matters because until LinkedIn, M&A liquidity has not been impressive in SaaS. Now, in ’16, maybe for the first time, it is. Yes, Salesforce bought ExactTarget for $3b+. But that was the biggest SaaS M&A deal for quite some time. HP bought Autonomy (not SaaS, but enterprise software) for $11 billion, but that was written off as a huge error. Oracle bought a bunch of mature stuff for a bit less and a bit more than a billion (Eloqua, Responsys, Taleo) and SAP bought mature, public Successfactors and Concur … but those deals were all of mature, and mostly public companies, so a bit of a yawn.
The liquidity we’ve had has also been hard won. Box had to wait a year to go IPO, to get to its $1.x billion valuation doing hundreds of million in ARR, growing at an epic pace. That’s hard work my friends.
Getting epic SaaS valuations and liquidity is harder than B2C. You don’t get the viral effects. And the multiple revenues, at least these days, aren’t that great. They really aren’t impressive.
Until now, no one has really, truly opened up the checkbook in SaaS/B2B(yes, I know, LinkedIn is only partly B2B). Now, someone has. Like Facebook went deep for WhatsApp, Microsoft went deep for LinkedIn. They spent a huge amount of cash to
The deals before were … conservative. Almost all of them. Even, and maybe even especially, the $1b+ ones.
Now we have our WhatsApp. The Big, Risky Bets in SaaS M&A with real $$$$ on the line.
This is mostly good for all of us founders.

Bir süredir geliştirmekte olduğum yan proje için çözmem gereken basit bir problem vardı: Platform üzerinde hesap oluşturan her bir müşteriye kendilerine özel bir domain nasıl oluşturabilirdim?
Bir örnek verelim: Diyelim ki kişilere kendi bloglarını oluşturmalarını sağlayan medium benzeri bir platform geliştirdiniz. Bloglarını oluşturmak isteyen kişiler sisteme gelip kendi isimleri ile blog oluşturabiliyor ve bu bloglarını onlara özel bir domain ile servis edebiliyorlar. Örnek olarak blog oluşturmayı sağlayan platformun domaini example.com ise ve siz x ismi ile bir blog oluşturduysanız platform tarafından size otomatik olarak x.example.com olarak bir domain sağlanıyor. Çözmeye çalıştığımız problem kaba taslak bu şekilde. Dilerseniz çözümün detaylarına geçelim.
Ben kendi projemde domain provider olarak namecheap, server olarak digitalocean üzerinde bir linux droplet, web uygulamasını servis etmek için nginx ve projemde de Go programlama dilini kullandım. Bu yüzden örnek çözümü anlatırken bunlar üzerinden ilerleyeceğim. Şunu söylemekte yarar var. Bu problemin çözümünde kullandığımız servislere herhangi bir bağımlılığımız yok. Siz dilediğiniz servis sağlayıcıları kullanabilirsiz. Lafı fazla uzatmadan başlayalım.
İlk olarak web uygulamanızı host etmek için linux sunucunuz hazır olmalı. Linux sunucunuzda nginx kurulu değilse buradan yardım alarak nginx i kurabilirsiniz. Go ile yazılmış web uygulamasını host etmek için docker kullandım. O yüzden linux sunucunuza docker i buradaki adımları uygulayarak kurmanız gerekiyor.
Go ile yazılmış web uygulamamızda örnek senaryomuza göre şunları yapmamız gerekiyor. Diyelim ki kullanıcılardan bir tanesi platformunuzu kullanarak xxx ismi ile bir blog oluşturdu ve sistem bu kullanıcıya xxx.example.com domainini tahsis etti. Bu domaine request atıldığında, ilk olarak domainden kullanıcının verdiği ismi (örnek: xxx) parse edeceğiz. Ardından bu isimle ilişkili bir kullanıcı olup olmadığına bakacak ve eğer varsa kullanıcıya özel içeriği göstereceğiz. Aksi halde 404 dönerek işlemi sonlandıracağız. Basitçe bunu yapan kod aşağıdaki gibi olmalı:
Yukarıda neler yapıyoruz bir açıklayalım:
Go programımız gördüğünüz gibi aslında bu kadar basit. Şimdi de bu kodu docker ile nasıl deploy edeceğimize bir bakalım:
Yukarıda ne yaptığımızın detayına fazla girmeyeceğim. Basitçe Go programımızı build etmek için gerekli scripti yazıyoruz ve container da 80 portunda çalışacak bir entrypoint oluşturuyoruz.
Dockerfile’da hazır olduğuna göre artık image’imizi build edebiliriz. Bunun için docker build komutunu çalıştırıyoruz:
docker build -t go-catchall-wildcard .
Docker image i linux sunucunuzda çalıştırmak için image’i dockerhub gibi bir repository’ye pushlayabilirsiniz. Sunucu tarafında aşağıdaki komutu kullanarak Go uygulamanızı ayağa kaldırabilirsiniz.
docker run -d — publish 5000:80 — restart=always go-catchall-wildcard:latest
Buraya kadar herşey tamamsa, Go uygulamamız linux sunucumuzda docker container üzerinde çalışıyor olmalı. Bu adımdan sonra sıra domain ile ilgili yönlendirme ve nginx üzerinde yapılması gereken ayarlara geliyor.
İlk olarak domainimizi satın aldığımız servis üzerinde bir takım yönlendirmeler yapmalıyız. Kullanıcıların kendi bloglarını oluşturmalarını sağlayan platformumuz example.com domaini üzerinde çalışıyordu. Kullanıcılar kendi isimleriyle bloglarını yarattıklarında xxx.example.com, yyy.example.com gibi kendilerine özel subdomainlere sahip oluyorlardı. Bu yüzden kullanıcılar xxx.example.com domainini tarayıcıya girdikleri zaman bizim bu subdomaini Go uygulamamızın çalıştığı sunucuya yönlendirmemiz gerekiyor. Platformumuzda binlerce kullanıcının olacağını düşünürsek kullanıcıya tahsis edilen xxx.example.com gibi her bir domain için manuel yönlendirme mi yapmamız gerekiyor?
Hayır tabiki. Bu tür manuellikler yapmayacağız. Bunun için domaini satın aldığımız servisin dns ayarlarında bir takım ayarlamalar yapmamız gerekiyor. Basitçe example.com domainimizin tüm subdomainlerini Go uygulamamızın çalıştığı sunucuya yönlendireceğiz. Bunun için domainimizin dns ayarlarına *.example.com şeklinde bir kayıt girmemiz gerekiyor. Bu kayıttaki wildcard(*) ile example.com root domainimize ait olan x.example.com, y.example.com gibi tüm subdomainleri tek bir adrese yani Go uygulamamızın çalıştığı sunucuya yönlendirmiş oluyoruz. Bu işlem catch-all (wildcard) olarak biliniyor.
Ben domaini namecheap servisi üzerinden aldığım için aşağıdaki resimde girdiğim wildcard kaydını görebilirsiniz. Eğer siz de namecheap kullanıyorsanız buradan detaylı yardım alabilirsiniz.
Bu kayıt ile yaptığım basitçe tüm adresleri (*) sunucu ip’sine yönlendiriyorum. Bu ayardan sonra x.example.com gibi adreslerin hepsi sunucumuza yönlendirilecek ve bu requestleri ilk olarak nginx karşılayıp daha sonra proxy görevi görerek bunları docker container üzerinde çalışan Go uygulamamıza yönlendirecek.
Bu yüzden nginx tarafında da yönlendirilen domainlerden gelen requestleri karşılamak ve Go uygulamasına aktarmak için gerekli ayarları yapmamız gerekiyor. Bunun için linux sunucumuza login oluyoruz. Ardından aşağıdaki komutları çalıştırıyoruz.
Burada ne yapıyoruz:
Dosyanın içeriği aşağıdaki gibi olmalı:
Ayarları girdikten sonra kaydedip çıkıyoruz. Yaptıklarımızı bir açıklayalım:
Basitçe *.example.com kaydı ile bu sunucuya bu domain üzerinden gelecek olan tüm requestleri proxy_pass kısmında belirttiğimiz http://localhost:5000 adresinde çalışan Go uygulamamıza yönlendiriyoruz. Hatırlarsanız docker imageimizi kurarken 5000:80 olarak containerımızda port mapping yapmıştık. Container kendi içerisinde 80 portu üzerinden servis veriyor ve 5000 portu ile diyoruz ki, container dışından 5000 portu ile gelen tüm requestleri 80 portuna yönlendir. proxy_set_header komutu ile orginal requestteki header bilgilirini docker tarafına aktarıyoruz ki bu bilgilere Go uygulamamız tarafından erişebilelim. Son olarak aşağıdaki komut ile ayarları girmiş olduğumuz dosyayı /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ lokasyonuna da kopyalıyoruz.
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com.conf
nginx -t komutunu çalıştırıp yaptığımız ayarların başarılı olup olmadığını kontrol ettikten sonra systemctl restart nginx komutu ile nginx’i restart ediyoruz. Tüm bunları yaptıktan sonra x.example.com olarak tarayıcıdan request attığınızda Go uygulamanızın cevabını görebiliyor olmalısınız.
Yapmamız gerekenler bu kadar. Bundan sonraki spesifik ayarlar sizin isteğinize kalmış. Örneğin *.example.com wildcard domaini için letsencrypt kullanarak requestlerinize ssl desteği sağlayabilirsiniz. Buradaki makale size yardımcı olacaktır. Source code için buradan github sayfasına gidebilirsiniz.
Kalın sağlıcakla.

スタートアップにとって、プロダクト/マーケットフィット(PMF)は重要なトピック。Marc Andreesenによると、PMFとは「優良なマーケットを狙って、そのマーケットを満足させるプロダクトを提供している状態」を指す。PMFは、マーケット選びとプロダクトの磨き込みの指針としては、素晴らしいコンセプトだ。
しかし、創業初期からSaaSの事業全体の仮説構築→検証を進めるには、PMFだけでは不十分だ。
何故ならば、「特定のマーケットの課題を解決するプロダクトを創る」ことだけに起業家の視野を狭めさせ、同時に考えるべきスケールへの道筋やエコノミクスの実現などの仮説検証を後回しにさせるからだ。このPMF以外の”フィット”の重要性は、複数の投資家が唱えるところだ(下部参照)。
今回は、その中でも一番使いやすいと思う、Brian Balfour氏の”Four Fit”をベースに、ARR 10億円+を目指すのに考えるべき「4+1」フィットについて解説する。また、例として、売上300億円を超えるEメール・マーケティングSaaSの3社（以下）を取り上げる。
まず第1に重要なのは、マーケット⇔プロダクトのフィット。
ここでの重要なポイントは、「マーケットの課題」を起点に「プロダクト」は後であるということ。Product/Market Fitと言うと、「プロダクトが先。マーケットが後」と捉えられルこともあるが、SaaSを始めとするB2Bは課題解決型なので、マーケットの課題が先に来ることが必要がある。B2Cの場合、Twitterのように市場創造型の場合もあるので、プロダクトが先に来るケースもある。
Eメール・マーケティングSaaS3社のマーケット⇔プロダクトを見てみると以下の通りだ。同じEメール・マーケティングでも、ターゲット顧客とペインが異なるため、提供されるプロダクトも大きく異なる。
次に考えるべきフィットは、「プロダクト⇔チャネル」・フィットである。チャネルとは、直営業、デジタル広告やバイラル（口コミ）など、SaaS企業の顧客獲得の手法を指す。
そもそも、プロダクトとチャネルがどう関係するのか？
結論から言うと、チャネルによって合うプロダクトの特性は異なる。例えば、バイラル（口コミ）をチャネルとしたい場合、以下の様なプロダクト特性が必要になる。
・機能は最大公約数的に、狭いがユーザー層が広い・顧客が説明しやすいように、プロダクトの機能がシンプル・顧客が導入してから価値を感じるまでの時間が短い・ネットワーク効果があるこのチャネルを選定する上では、知っておくべき1つのルール”Power Law of Distribution”がある。Peter・Thiel氏の言葉を借りると、以下の通り。
”Power Law of Distribution”とは、以下の図に示すように、高成長の初期のSaaS企業の多くは「顧客獲得の70–80%が、1つの有効なチャネルに偏っている」という経験則だ。
これを踏まえて、事例のSaaS3社の「プロダクト⇔チャネル」・フィットを見てみると、以下で見て判る通り、プロダクト特性とメインチャネルを合わせた戦略をとっている。
プロダクト⇔チャネルの次に考えるべきは、「チャネル⇔エコノミクス」のフィットだ。SaaSのエコノミクスはLTV/CAC等がよく使われるが、ここではシンプルにARPU(Average Revenue Per User)とCAC(Customer Acquisition Cost)の関係で説明する。
まず「CAC」は前述の「チャネル」と密接に関係している。例えば、口コミはCACが最も低いのに対し、直営業は最もCACが高い。一方、ARPUは、SaaSだと数千~万円/年の低ARPUから、数千万円/年～の高ARPUまで幅がある。
ではどのような「ARPU」と「CAC」のフィットが望ましいのか？
結論から言うと、以下の通り”低CAC⇔低ARPU”、ないしは”高CAC⇔高ARPU”がSaaSでは理想的だ。（特に後者の方が）
もちろん、低CACで高ARPUにフィットできれば言うことは無いが、”青い鳥”を追うようなもので現実的には実現しにくい。一方、高CACのチャネルがメインで、低いARPUしか獲得できないのならば、当然ながら”死”を意味する。この「高CAC⇔低ARPU」ケースは、「マーケットの課題があるのに、SaaS化されず取り残されている市場」の落とし穴なので、この市場を狙う場合は、高ARPUの顧客セグメントは無いか？、ないしは口コミなどの低CACでもスケールできないか？を入念に検証する必要がある。
この「チャネル⇔エコノミクス」フィットを、SaaS3社の例で見てみると、以下の図の通り。例えば、「高CAC」な直営業主体のMarketoは、ARPUも高く年100~500万円。一方、口コミでの低CACのMailChimpは、ARPUも低く、年1万円~程度で、3社ともチャネルの「CAC」に見合った「ARPU」を設定し、望むエコノミクスを実現している。
第4のフィットは、「エコノミクス⇔マーケット」フィットだ。
ここでは、前出の「ARPU≒エコノミクス」を前提とした場合に、「マーケット」のどの位の社数を取る必要があるのか？、それが現実的な「マーケット」シェアとして可能か？を振り返って確認する。そのための前提として、日本のIPOの1つの目安である「ARR10億円」と仮定して説明を進める。この「ARPU≒エコノミクス」と「必要なユーザー社数≒マーケット」を図に示すと、以下の通りだ。
オレンジのARR10億円ラインは、ARPU1,000万円/年であれば100社必要、ARPU1,000円/年であれば100万社必要、などARR10億円を達成するのに必要なARPUと社数のボーダーラインを示している。
この図で言うと、自社の設定しているエコノミクス（ARPU）とマーケット（獲得ユーザー社数）がグラフ右側にあれば、フィットできていると言える。但し、右側に来たとしても、実現可能性を考える上で、ターゲットとする顧客層のTAMを踏まえて、市場シェアをどの程度取るつもりなのか？は確認が必要だ。仮に市場シェアが70%とか90%になるようであれば、あまりにも現実的ではないので、見直しをお勧めする。
この「エコノミクス⇔マーケット」で、Marketo、HubSpot、MailChimpの3社を見てみると、下の様になる。それぞれ100社、1,000社、10万社以上獲得の見通しが立てば、ARR10億円の達成は見込めることになるし、事実実現して大きく上回っている。
最後のフィットは、「チーム⇔+α(その他の要素)」のフィットだ。
これまで見てきた、4つのマーケット⇔プロダクト⇔チャネル⇔エコノミクスの実現する、最も重要な先行指標は「チーム」だ。
Peter・Thiel氏が言う「Unfair Advantage」や、VCが起業家との面談で聞く「Why you?」に近いが、上記のフィットを継続的に実現し続けられるかは、チームの経験/スキルセットに大きく依存する。そのため、創業初期のSaaSで、上記の4つのフィットを実現する上で、コアとなるチームが不十分と感じる場合は、できる限り早めに手を打った方が良い。
SaaS3社の例で見てみよう。
例えば、Marketoは、オンプレCRM/マーケソフトの上場企業の社長だった、Philを中心に創業した。故に、顧客である大企業とのネットワークもあるため、顧客の課題も熟知していた。またCTOのDavidも前職でもCTOをしており、大企業向けプロダクトの開発スキルも十分に持っていた。
HubSpotは、ソフトウェア・ベンチャー数社で経営経験のあるBrianとDharmeshの2人がMITのMBA在学中の2004年に出会ったことをきっかけに創業したベンチャーだ。二人は、オンプレにはないUI/UXの優れ、素早いプロダクト作りのノウハウを持ち合わせていたため、all-in-oneのMA/Sales/CSツールの開発が可能だった。しかもインバウンド・マーケやインサイド・セールスでのクロージングにも強かったため、中規模以上の企業を中心に獲得することができた。
以上を踏まえて、SaaS3社の事例で「4+1」フィットをまとめると、以下の図の通りである。どのSaaSの領域でも同じようなパターンが多いので、参考の一助になれば嬉しい。
VCの観点でもう少し付け加えると、VCから資金調達をする場合には、高い売上成長率を目指しやすい、Marketo型かHubSpot型が望ましく、MailChimp型は望ましくない。
なぜならば、MailChimp型の様な低ARPU型の一方、口コミやアドの様な低CAC型で小規模企業を高回転で獲得することは現実的に非常に困難であり、また参入障壁も低いので、競合が表れやすく、高成長を実現しにくいからだ。事実、Marketo、HubSpotはVCから資金調達をして短期の成長を実現できている一方、MailChimpはファースト・ムーバーにもかかわらず、低成長率のため、今日まで一度もVCから調達していない。(ある意味、低成長でも売上600億円まで持って行ったのは素晴らしいが)

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is not an easy job. It requires a lot of experience and hard work to build a secure authentication/authorization system for today’s applications. You need to be aware of recent upgrades to the standards and be up to date all the time. At some point, if you think that you have taken care of everything and you’re done, don’t be surprised when your Product team asks for SSO with Google, OneLogin or SAML support. You have a lot to do in this domain even for a simple application. In SaaS world, applications are multi-tenant, meaning that your software application serves multiple customers. This brings additional complexity when it comes to identity management.
At OpsGenie, we handle all identity management requirements with in-house developed modules. One of the reasons is that there were no mature off-the-shelf solutions available at the time. When we look at the market now, there are excellent solutions you can use, especially if you are just starting your journey. For a company like us with an established customer base, which solution to use is still not a simple decision. Recently, we evaluated possible in-house solutions and the market-ready solutions in detail as we need IAM for another application that we have been developing, called Badges (a gamification based performance tracking and optimization SaaS application). And in this blog post, we’ll share our criteria and final decisions with you.
Tools like Auth0 and AWS Cognito aim to help us solve identity management problems fairly easily. They use proven industry standards while trying to give you the most secure and easy-to-use environment.
Although you can leverage them at scale for big applications as well, if you are just trying an idea or building a startup, it makes a lot of sense to outsource the identity management of your application.
Here are important decision points to be considered when choosing between an in-house developed solution or using a managed service:
Services like Auth0 and AWS Cognito have quickstarts available for different languages and frameworks. There are also plug and play authentication widgets available to get you started pretty quickly. On the other hand, you need to learn their APIs and build your application considering their limitations. With this approach, you won’t always get what you want. You may have a specific feature you desperately need, but the service provider may not prioritize your request. This is a common problem and will force you to hack the code. So, you will lose flexibility there.
There are serious downsides of building a multi-tenant application with both Auth0 and AWS Cognito but this is another blog’s topic! I assure you currently it is not trivial to build a multi-tenant app with these tools.
Customers expect SLA’s (Service Level Agreement) from SaaS applications. If you use a managed service for identity management, your app can never be more available than they are as these services will be at the core of your app. For an application like OpsGenie, this is not acceptable because we are a mission critical system that needs to be up and running all the time. But, this dependency is totally acceptable for most non-mission critical applications on the market as these applications have pretty good SLAs.
Most companies don’t want their sensitive data scattered around different services. It is already hard to convince them to use a cloud based service. Relying on different systems and having to ask your customers to also trust those third party (or add-on) services brings other burdens. On the other hand, for most identity management solutions, as from ground up, they use proven standards and provide compliance & certifications that you would not be able to get easily — and without spending a lot of money.
User experience is more important than ever. You would not want to give your users bad experience because of the limitations of a service that you rely on. When you develop IAM part of your app yourself, you have the freedom to choose the flow you want. You don’t have to compromise. It is not totally the case with the current identity management solutions, though. As you will see in detail in the coming blog posts, you will have to design your multi-tenant application by considering what is provided by the service you use. You should not have to design based on the service’s capabilities. On the contrary, services should be flexible enough to support the flow you want.
It is always about the cost. If you could build and manage the whole thing by yourself without spending too much time and hence money, why would you bother using a service, right?
The price here depends on a lot of variables. One of the most important ones that I would like to point out is the price of the service. Identity management services are relatively expensive services. This can be a problem when you have lots of users. But if you are just starting, it is tomorrow’s problem.
If your service requirements allow you to do so, don’t hesitate to go with a managed service at the beginning.
Especially while developing MVP (Minimum Viable Product), you don’t want to invest a lot. You are just trying an idea and don’t have a lot of users. Besides, there is no guarantee that you will ever have those users. So, going with a managed service makes a lot more sense than developing your in-house identity management system at the beginning.
You will also have global security compliances without investing a lot of money. These security compliances are gold, especially if you are aiming enterprise market. Nowadays, enterprises and most companies want to use SSO because it is a smart thing to do. On your side, this means spending money. With a managed service, you can have your SSO setup pretty quickly.
Managing the users on your own or using a managed service has both its advantages and disadvantages. In this blog post, we have looked at the problem from four different aspects; User Experience, Ease of Implementation, Uptime & Security SLAs and Cost.
At OpsGenie, as I’ve stated earlier, we have been developing a brand new application called Badges. For this application, we have certain requirements for identity management such as username-password based login, SSO with Google, and multi-tenancy support. After a detailed evaluation phase, for this application, we decided to go with a managed identity management service, Auth0. The main reason for this is that we did not want to deal with all the complexities of this domain as we are just getting started. Compared to building it in-house, it was fast and easy.
In the following blog posts of this series, we will share our experiences with evaluating Auth0 and AWS Cognito, as well as steps to integrate our application with Auth0 and problems we faced with.

Be the first to respond.
Let’s imagine a possible situation. Two brands with similar target audiences, with reliable and well-developed services and equally awesome customer service.
One of these brands is your brand. The other is your competitors’.
So, which one do you think the users should choose?
You may think it’s the cheaper one. But actually, research shows that low prices may sometimes deter users from buying from the cheap brand and make them choose more expensive brands instead.
You may think it’s the one that’s been on the market longer. But in fact, many new products, such as Netflix or Spotify became blockbusters in an instant, outperforming the older players by a wide margin.
Or maybe you think it all just has to be based on the user’s individual preferences. But as much as we like to think of ourselves and our users as unique individuals, social psychologists will tell you that people often tend to behave in certain, predictable ways.
And it can be predicted that the brand the client will choose is the one he or she trusts more.
Trust is one of the hardest things to earn and the easiest to lose and it’s definitely not acquired without a good reason. But there are some tried and tested methods that every brand can use to inspire customer trust, increase engagement and turn more leads into sales. What are they?
When users first encounter your product or service, they often don’t know much how it works, what it looks like, how much it costs… Sometimes they don’t even know what it does! Make sure you leave no such blindspots, because transparency and information breed trust. The more information about the product or service, the more willing they are to trust you with their money.
According to the study reported by Adweek, more than 80% of buyers do online research before purchasing a product. What is more, more than 40% of these buyers are methodical in their approach — they analyze available options and make decisions based on facts and data. So, think about value you want to provide, support with numbers and say it!
👉 Tip: Not sure how to create a knowledge base?Look for software such as KnowledgeOwl, Zendesk or Freshdesk. These apps won’t only help you to build your KB, but they come together with great knowledge bases telling you how to do this step by step!
Product pages or knowledge bases are effective trust builders, but they have a serious drawback — not everybody will visit them. But there are pages that almost everybody visits on a regular basis. Think Twitter. Facebook. Instagram. They can all help you build trust with visitors who have never heard about you. Those who follow your social media, whether actively or not, show that they endorse your brand. Their endorsement can help you convince even more people to trust you. What you need is an account, some fairly regular activity and an ever-expanding circle of followers.
As Timothy Alexander says in his article on social media,
”Social media is not just a way to sell to your customers. It is a way to connect, create a community, and build trust and loyalty. (…) Start relating to customers and stop selling to them. When you build trust and loyalty, the sales will come.”
Let’s face it. Users are often wary of glorifying descriptions of your amazing product ad its perfect features — especially if your’re the one writing them! You may be an expert on your soft, but your not an independent expert — at least not in the eyes of your clients to be, who may perceive you as some mischievous money-driven owner just wanting to sell and earn more. Your present clients, on the other hand, come across to as being on the same side as they are, only being able to say a lot about their true experience with your soft.
Nothing works quite as well as real-life experience, so if clients had a happy experience with your app or website, make sure they say this out loud. If a review is relatable and clearly shows the benefits of using your app — it’s certain to build trust among the readers. And it may be even more effective when it’s posted on a third-party site rather than your own.
👉 Tip: Try to get to as many directories and review websites as you can. The more lists feature your brand, the greater the chance that your prospective user will spot it and trust it! Here are some SaaS Directories & Review Websites and How to Get Listed There.
There’s one thing that works better than a review. And this is a review written by the key player or a famous expert in your field. If such a person thinks your service great you’ll soon have their fains and followers (and soon your clients) — thinking that too!
Testimonials are great for creating trust in any company. As Yoast reports, testimonials influence the perceived trustworthiness of an online store more than trust seals or even this store’s overall reputation! But in order to earn trust they need to be valuable for readers. Sometimes even negative feedback can work.
Many visitors to your site are just looking around, gathering information, not trusting and ready enough to subscribe, sign up for a trial or buy a product or serivce. But if they saw other people doing just that… Wouldn’t they feel more secure and more willing to trust you?
Oh yes, they would. Some simple tricks psychologists would call social proof can do wonders for you here by showing that so many other visitors are achieving your conversion aims this instant! Similar effects can be achieved if you display information about what has currently been done to improve your service… Or just display system status, like Typeform does. More trust activated in… 3… 2… 1… .
👉 Tip: You can use these apps to display activity notifications:1. Fomo — with Fomo you can display both what your users did (signed up, upgraded to a higher plan) and what you did (updates to the soft)2. Proof —you can display user activity notifications and setup is a matter of mere minutes
One of the most common visitor anxieties is business reliability, and this is even more prominent in SaaS companies, which store sensitive data in the cloud. The same is true for online payments and having to provide all these personal details… These can often be a deciding factor that stops a potential client from trusting you with their money.
Many studies similar to this one suggest a trust seal ensuring secure payment or a trust-inducing logo can make all the difference between buying your product and not doing so. Assure your users that their data is encrypted, that the page is secure and payment method safe to boost trust levels instantly.
👉 Tip: Put your seals in the right place.Simply having a trust seal on your website or landing page can improve consumer confidence, but their location is just as important. Moving trust seals closer to lead capture fields will help to evoke more trust in users who are entering sensitive information. Placing then in the header or footer makes them always visible to your potential buyers.
Trust. If your prospective users don’t trust your product and your brand, they simply won’t turn into clients. These 6 methods can help you quickly increase your clients’ confidence in your brand, increase engagement and generate more sales.
But there’s one more thing that can help you and this is understanding your users: their needs, expectations and fears. If you know what these are, you can respond to them adequately with your own trust-building strategy.
For example, if your users are concerned about paying on-line, user notifications and badges are probably a must. If they are afraid that your product will not be easy to use — make sure you have plenty of reviews that say that it is! If the product is not popular yet and they may fear the unknown — build your social network or try to get a few testimonials from a popular / respected client. Here’s a simple 9-step framework that can help you get to know your users better —(you can use it write your UVP, too!):

Top highlight
~ and finally demoed it to my mom
Two years ago
I walked back home after an exhausting but fun, four hour interview. There was an offer letter in my hand, which mentioned the position as 'Business Development Executive.’
I walked up the stairs, pushed the partially open door and passed on the envelope to mom.
‘Freshdesk? Seems like a furniture company.’
'I thought that they deliver freshly prepared food to desks.’ chipped in dad.
'It’s a small IT startup that makes and sells software. They’ve got around 200 employees. I’ve been offered a role in the sales team.'
'Just 200? Are you sure you want to make a switch.’
'You don’t even speak to relatives when they come home. How will you sell to customers?’
“Everything you’ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear.” — George Addair
'Well, I don’t have anything to lose, the workplace seems like fun, and they’ve got a TT table.’ I shrugged.
‘Ha ha, go ahead. You are twenty three now. You have to take these risks.’
“If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat! Just get on.” — Sheryl Sandberg
Two years later, the biggest bet of my career seems to have paid off, multifold.
Last Sunday morning
‘Amma, I celebrate two years at Freshdesk this week.’
‘Oh, two years and I don’t even know what exactly you do at work.’
Sarcasm alert.
‘Would you like a demo of Freshdesk?’ I asked, just like the thousands of times I’ve asked customers over calls.
Fifteen minutes later, mom, dad and sister were on the sofa. My mac was perched on the dining table and I began the most nervous demo of my life.
“So, Freshdesk is a SaaS based…”
‘What is SaaS?’
‘What do you mean by the cloud?’
‘What the purpose of integrating Facebook and Twitter?’
‘How do you manage to separate queries coming in from different sources?’
‘This is tough to learn. How long does it take to implement this?’
‘How do you manage to sell this to people all over the world from Chennai?’
The demo lasted ninety minutes.
‘I still can’t believe you, being such an introvert, manage to talk to so many people everyday.’ quipped mom.
I broke into a smile when she added, ‘Maybe we can use this to track requests in our apartment instead of all the emails and phone calls.’
Deal closed-won.
For me, the last two years have constituted a steep learning curve. I’ve come a long way from being the person who used to dread talking to people. I can keep conversations going and strike a rapport with customers.
I’ve learnt to make the sales process more human.
Make a customer, not a sale. — Katherine Barchetti
I found that ethics and honesty matter. Customers stay with you for life when you do what is right for them.
I realised that there are a lot of genuine people who will watch your back, when you fall. People who help you learn and grow.
I’ve got to know that people all around the world are the same kind of awesome. Sometimes, you just need to know them better.
Two years ago, I would have given anything for this kind of experience, learning and peers. It has been one amazing journey.
Today, I love what I’m doing. I’m talking to people all over the world, building relationships and getting to know how organisations work. I’m making life easier for those who work in a ‘thankless’ customer support job. I know what failure means and I’ve realised that when you are pushed into a corner, you need to come out all guns blazing.
And in between all that, when you find money hitting the bank, it’s pure bliss.
Don't instruct, share.

Be the first to respond.
A product announcement checklist only becomes useful when you have an effective product announcement framework and prioritization method in place.
Assuming that’s taken care of, product launches and announcements have a lot of moving parts.
It can quickly become overwhelming making sure everything is executed according to plan and in its rightful place on launch day.
So without further ado, here’s a comprehensive checklist to for your product announcements and product launches.
Note that no single launch or announcement will require all of these.
This is meant to be comprehensive — use your judgement to know what you should implement, and leave off, for each announcement.

The economics of a SaaS sales rep can make or break a business. Below are some thoughts to keep in mind regarding your SaaS sales team:
The best SaaS reps sell 4x their pay. The very best reps tend to make 4x their all-in compensation including benefits, but don’t scoff at a rep earning 2x or 3x their pay. So long as the reps are using the leads you give them efficiently and they’re comfortably profitable, keep them.
Hiring is the way to growth. Hiring sales reps is the only reliable way to grow for a business focused on enterprise customers. It’s dangerous to assume growth happens magically, for instance assuming the average contract value will improve because you’re going to add more features or the sales cycle will shrink as the market becomes more aware of you. Stay conservative and assume the only way to grow revenue is the addition of reps, not gradual increases in contract size or other miracles.
Add 1 to 3 reps. When you model out your cash need for the year, assume your VP of Sales can add reps at a reasonable pace: at most 1 a quarter for very seasoned reps and up to 3 a quarter for the less experienced. The more complex the sales cycle, the harder it will be to find reps that are a good fit. Assume reps will need time to ramp, generally 3 to 6 months depending on the length and complexity of the sales cycle. If you’re adding inexperienced reps, hire them in classes (at least 2 at a time).
Failure is high. The rule of thumb is that for every 5 reps you hire, 2 are going to be a waste of time and resources, 1 will be a stud that hits quota, and 2 will be below quota but worth keeping and still economic (generating revenue that is 2x to 3x their compensation). Going 3 for 5 is actually fantastic, but you’ll go through a lot brain damage to get there.
1:8 ratio. For every 8 reps you hire, go ahead and assume you need a VP of Sales or sales manager. You do not need a VP of Sales until you hire 5 to 8 sales reps — while you’re small, the sales reps should report directly to you.
Leads first. Don’t hire reps unless you’ve got the leads and your existing reps are at capacity. Poor leads or a lack of enough qualified leads is a great way to kill morale and waste a lot of time and money. That said, every rep at every level should do some outbounding. We like seeing reps spend at least 30% of their time on outbounding and generating their own leads.
Hire once reps are good enough. Once a rep is generating revenue that is at least 2x to 3x their compensation, if you have enough cash and leads, you should be hiring the next rep or even two. At the same time, if a new rep has had enough time to season and isn’t making at least 2x while also burning good leads, cut them.
Growing the enterprise sales team is the best way to forecast growing your topline. Depending on larger contract sizes, shorter sales cycles, random upgrades with no historical basis, and other slight of hand is a good way to miss projections and even worse, run out of cash.

SaaS 是軟體即服務（Software as a Service）的簡稱，有別於過去需要將軟體下載、安裝到本機端才能使用，並且還要自行進行後續維護的產品模式，SaaS 產品允許使用者簡單地透過網路與網頁瀏覽器來使用軟體，資料都儲存在雲端，因此使用者不但可以跨裝置使用軟體，所有的開發、維護、更新也都是由服務商（產品提供者）來負責營運。
大部分 SaaS 產品都採取授權或是訂閱制的方式來收費，客戶不需要一次性買斷，在需要時付費即可使用，例如 Salesforce, Dropbox, Grammarly, MailChimp, Slack, Shopify, Trello 都算是 SaaS 模式的產品。
SaaS 一個常見的特色為，先提供 7 天至 30 天的免費試用版本、或是功能有限的免費 Lite 版本給初步註冊的使用者，後續再引導使用者成為付費客戶。
個人用戶的決策時間通常較短、轉換成本低，企業用戶的決策時間較長、轉換成本高，無論是哪一種使用者，引導他們在免費試用期間完成特定任務，親身經歷這個產品可以為他們帶來的好處，可以大大增加使用者選擇這個產品並轉換為付費客戶的機會。
若沒有好好照顧這些剛註冊的新用戶，可能會因為產品功能太多、太複雜而放棄使用。從產品團隊的角度來看「我們提供了這麼功能強大的產品你卻不懂欣賞！」從使用者的角度來看則是「天啊！這麼多按鈕跟分頁，我到底要從哪裡開始？算了明天再來研究好了～～～」然後明天他就忘了啊！因此好好設計 Onboarding 流程是非常重要的！
訂閱制的 SaaS 產品除了分為月費、年費制外，通常也會分成不同計畫等級來提供不同的功能、服務容量上限給不同類型的客戶，有些則會針對大型客戶提供需要額外報價的客製化服務，因此在設計產品時要考慮到功能的擴充性與彈性，來符合定價分層的商業模式，例如：功能有使用的容量/數量上限、進階功能只給付費升級的用戶使用。
有些產品則會讓已經訂閱的用戶再付費加購單一功能，這付費續約與加購相關的層級與設計之複雜，有時會有專責 Billing 的人來統合處理。
若是談論變現途徑，B2B SaaS 產品是一種很熱門的類型。企業客戶的決策時間較長，決策者與實際的使用者可能是不同的人，而實際的使用者可能又分為很多不同類型的角色。
A. 同個 Account 內的不同使用者
以網路開店平台來說，電商品牌老闆是決策者，員工則分為產品進貨與上架、訂單管理與商品出貨、行銷活動設計與廣告投放 … 等等，每個角色會使用到的功能不同、但又會重疊，在功能設計或改版時要考慮到多個面向。
舉例來說，「庫存管理」是產品進貨員工與商品出貨員工都會使用到的功能，而「報表及分析」功能要服務的對象可能更多，老闆想知道總體業績與趨勢、行銷團隊想知道促銷活動的成效、負責產品進貨的同事需要瞭解銷售與囤貨狀況，同一個 Account 裡的不同角色因此會提出很不一樣的需求回饋。
B. 不同 Account 之間的使用情境差異
除了同一個 Account 內不同角色的需求差異外，每個 Account 之間的需求也可能會差很多。儘管產品一開始聚焦於解決一個問題、服務一種使用者群體，但隨著產品與公司業務成長，服務對象運用的使用情境會愈來愈多元。
以開店平台為例，販賣食物、飾品、3C產品的客戶會有截然不同的回饋，賣食物的客戶想要串接黑貓冷凍物流、飾品客戶說他們每週大量上架、3C產品賣家說他們規格比較特別。更甚者，有些 SaaS 產品可能同時為服務企業用戶（B2B）與個人用戶（B2C），例如 Slack 服務的使用者就兩者都包含。
C. 客戶的客戶
部分 SaaS 軟體是提供產品讓客戶再去服務他們的客戶，大部分與 CRM 相關的產品都會遇到這樣多重使用者的狀況。服務直接客戶之外，幫助客戶能夠順利的去服務他們的客戶才是最終的目的，畢竟這才是客戶本人使用產品的目的，也是他繼續使用產品（續約）的意願來源。
以開店平台為例，產品客戶使用後台來設計電商網站、上架商品、處理訂單與出貨，客戶的客戶——顧客則在前台瀏覽商品、下訂單。以 MailChimp 為例，客戶在後台設定要發送的信件內容與對象，客戶的客戶——收件者則在信箱收信、瀏覽信件內容、點擊 CTA 連結。
SaaS 產品面對的使用者面向很多，因此在每次處理需求與問題時，先分清楚這次的服務對象是誰，並考慮到會不會影響到其他類型的使用者。
既然稱為軟體即服務（Software as a Service），提供一個完整的服務體驗絕對是必要的，身為 SaaS 產品經理，與公司內部其他第一線接觸客戶與使用者的同事充分合作，共同解決使用者問題、滿足使用者需求，打造良好而完整的線上線下產品體驗。
軟體開發方面，版本控制與 CI/CD（持續性整合與發佈）格外重要，瞭解各種測試方法、自動化部署流程並與 DevOps 團隊密切合作，一起為產品的穩定性把關。
商業指標為產品在公司中最高層級的指標，它們直指公司目標，是老闆與業務單位最關注的部分，攸關公司商業模式的健康狀況與總體成長。產品經理雖然不直接負責商業指標的維護，但商業指標與產品指標通常息息相關。以下為常見的 SaaS 商業指標。
訂閱制 SaaS 產品中的 MRR 代表每個月持續訂閱服務的費用收入，計算方式即為各分層定價月費乘以各級別付費用戶數量，也包含軟體內額外加購的功能，或是客製化服務的費用。
這個指標中的用戶通常可以再細分為新付費用戶、現有用戶升級、現有用戶降級、現有用戶持平續約、流失的付費用戶，或是依照不同的分層定價級別來分類。
LTV 代表的是客戶在其生命週期內將帶來多少價值，每間公司的計算方式會根據商業模式而有所不同。以 SaaS 來說，因為流失的客戶很難會再回來，所以所謂的生命週期通常就是客戶開始付費到流失的時間長度。LTV 也常跟客戶獲取成本（Customer Acquisition Cost, CAC）拿來比較，通常 LTV 大於 CAC 的三倍才會被認定是在健康的狀態下成長。
付費客戶生命週期的長短跟產品特性、服務對象有很大的關係，例如 LinkedIn 的進階會員服務，許多求職者只會在積極求職的三個月內期間使用，一旦找到工作就會降級為一般的免費會員；或例如 Trello 是適合小型軟體團隊利用的開發看板，但隨著開發團隊與公司成長後，可能就會去尋找功能更強大、適用情境更彈性的產品，舉例來說轉換到 JIRA。
團隊可以透過研究數據背後代表的意義來做商業決策，例如開發新的產品線給更進階的用戶，或是專心獲取更多小型用戶等等。
有別於一些產品會關注留存（Retention），SaaS 類型的產品更傾向關注流失（Churn）。留存用戶、留存率能夠代表的意義很彈性，每個公司應根據產品特性來自行定義，例如幾天/月內回來瀏覽網站/回購商品的用戶/帳戶，而針對 SaaS 產品而言，通常是指有持續付費續約的用戶。
流失則代表原先使用產品的客戶不再繼續使用，流失率即為一段時間內流失掉的用戶比例。
其實留存與流失這兩個指標是一體兩面的，差別在於思考角度的不同，前者讓人思考「我們如何吸引使用者不斷回來？」，後者則更像是「我們要如何避免他們離開、轉換平台？」，其背後隱含的的思維是客戶預設會一直留在這個產品上。
這是因為 SaaS 產品通常工具型用途，若是企業用戶工作上每天都會用到的軟體，這時候關注一小段時間區間的留存率就沒有意義。而 SaaS 產品的轉換成本高，雖然轉換產品的決策時間長，但一旦決定就會很有效率的執行——有可能這個月他們照常每天使用產品，但同時已經開始佈局與設定另一個競品，月底約期一到就直接轉換到其他產品，這樣的客戶通常一旦流失就一去不復返。
流失率可以分為「免費用戶」與「付費用戶」，免費用戶是註冊後但還沒開始付費使用就離開的使用者，在定義上需要給定一個時間區間；付費用戶流失則是指從付費訂閱成為不再續約（或降級為免費版本）的用戶，他們的流失會對 MRR 造成負面影響。對於成熟的 SaaS 公司，持續提供好的服務來降低流失率是很重要的目標。
基於 SaaS 產品的特性，我將產品經理會接觸到的部分分為兩塊：官方網站（Official Website）與核心產品（Core Product），前者為使用者第一次接觸到這個品牌、產品的地方，除了產品經理外，有時會由獨立的 Growth PM 或是行銷團隊負責，後者則是實際提供產品服務的地方，也就是產品經理花最多時間研究、設計與開發的部分。
SaaS 產品的官方網站可以視為一個類電商網站，目標是將流量轉換為註冊用戶，並在試用之後將免費用戶轉換為付費客戶。對照到一般電商網站的目標，即為將流量轉換為商店會員，最終轉換為訂單，因此電商網站會看的指標如流量、註冊轉換率、付費轉換率都是在 SaaS 官網也會關注的指標。
轉換只是第一步。若是包含免費與付費版本的 SaaS 產品，使用者註冊成為免費用戶後，下一步就是引導有潛力的用戶發現產品的好，進而升級為付費用戶。若是有限定免費試用時間的 SaaS 產品，時間一到就是鎖帳號或付費訂閱兩條路，儘管成功轉換一部分使用者為付費用戶也不能掉以輕心，下一步就是持續解決用戶問題、優化產品，讓用戶願意永無止盡的續約下去！
在各式各樣的指標中，SaaS 產品中最重要的是與參與度（Engagement）相關的指標。SaaS 產品是個工具，付費買下這個產品不是結束，有持續使用才是重點！
1. 新手上路參與度（Onboarding Engagement）
如同文章前面段落所述，「引導使用者完成任務」對於新用戶尤其重要，在轉換為付費用戶之前，新用戶的留存、完成的任務可以反映出用戶有沒有在使用產品的過程中挖掘到價值並解決到他的問題。
相關的指標如：新用戶在試用期間內的留存率、每個 Onboarding 任務步驟的轉換率、有開始進行與已完成整個 Onboarding 流程的用戶數比例，以及他們成為付費用戶轉換率的差異。
值得注意的是，有些 SaaS 產品 Onboarding 與付費轉換中也會夾雜其他非產品本身的因素，例如客服很快速的回覆使用問題、AM 協助釐清使用情境與需求、公司開辦的線上線下教學課程…等也都有助於新用戶更認識產品。
2. 活躍用戶（Active User）
活躍用戶指標包含 DAU（Daily Active User 日活躍用戶）、MAU（Monthly Active User 月活躍用戶），其定義會因公司對「活躍」的定義不同而異，例如會員登入、查看某個頁面、使用某個功能、完成一次付費訂單都可能被定義為活躍。
對於每日工作必備的 B2B SaaS 產品來說（ex. Slack, JIRA）每天都會有客戶的員工去使用產品，因此 DAU 在這個情況下基本上是沒有意義的。而像報帳、請假系統等不一定會每天使用的產品來說，拿使用情境不同的產品 benchmark 來作為比較的數據只會造成不當的期待。
除此之外，若是企業用戶，一個企業用戶可能會開放給多位員工使用，有些公司甚至會為公司每一位員工開一個帳號，但實際上會積極使用該產品的可能只有一部分部門的員工，因此在計算前要先定義清楚想要看到的數據與代表的意義是什麼，再來排除雜訊與例外狀況。
利用 DAU / MAU 也可以計算出使用者對產品的黏著度，來瞭解活躍用戶平均每個月回來使用產品的天數。
3. 重要功能的使用量（Key Feature Adoption）
這可以包含重要功能的使用人數、頻率、時間長短，通常可以用來排序出影響範圍較大的功能來進行優化，或是在 Beta 上線新功能時觀察使用狀況是否如預期，驗證我們對於用戶與產品互動的狀況。
俗話說的好，嫌貨才是買貨人，客戶會提出方方面面的問題與需求，但有時候用戶並不真的了解自己的需求，也不真的願意接受他自己提的解法，嘴巴說的和身體做的完全不是一回事！因此除了質化訪談蒐集回饋，透過實際互動的量化數據來佐證會讓決策方向更清晰。
這個指標數據也可以拿來區分不同類型的使用者、使用情境，若有特定一群使用者的使用模式有別於產品中的其他使用者，可以做為我們切新產品線、發展新商業模式與定價方法、或行銷產品給另外一群未開發的新用戶的靈感來源。
在上述「分清楚使用者」的篇章中提到了「客戶的客戶」這個特殊群體，幫助客戶追蹤與他的使用者相關的指標也很重要，因為這代表了客戶使用產品所帶來的成效。
這部分就非常因產品而異。再次以開店平台舉例，客戶的客戶——顧客會瀏覽的前台即為一個電商網站，流量、轉換率等電商相關指標就會是追蹤的重點；以 MailChimp 為例，就會看開信率、CTA 轉換率。除了我們自己追蹤外，客戶通常也會希望在後台有個 Dashboard 讓他們自行研究與分析這些指標的數據。
這些數據的高低很多時候與客戶本身如何使用產品有關，但用我們的產品幫助客戶成功達成任務就是產品本身的價值所在，持續追蹤這些指標數據來優化產品不但可以維護跟現有用戶的關係，也會是業務對外的銷售點。
以上介紹了 SaaS 的產品特性以及相對應得設計思維與常見指標，而其中最核心的概念就是獲取新用戶、留下現有用戶、從現有用戶身上變現，所有的指標都圍繞在這幾個概念上。
就算是在同一種商業模式之下，也還會因產品特性、服務對象不同而延伸出獨特的關鍵指標，但整體思維還是大同小異的——配合商業目標來設定產品目標、找出最重要的關鍵指標、辨認指標的基準 benchmark、運用質化/量化資料規劃優先級、設計產品與測試/實驗方法。

Quick — name one startup you know using a single-tenant architecture. Got one? Yeah, me neither.
Multi-tenant architectures are the standard way to run a startup these days. Create a database, provision some servers, add a load balancer, top it off with some caching and call it a day.
But why?
What is it about multi-tenant that’s superior to single-tenant? Is it cost? Complexity? Security? Scale?
Recently I started working on a new product and the multi-tenant architecture felt ungodly complex. There had to be a better solution — a quicker way to get up and running that wouldn’t create scaling issues for us later on.
Now, I’ll be honest. I’ve been developing software and running websites for 15 years and I’ve never had to deal with “internet scale” concerns. Hell, I’ve barely even had to deal with caching. I’ve been working on Kumu the past five years and — outside of embeds — Kumu’s traffic can be handled by a single large server. It’s a powerful, sophisticated tool, and growth has been solid, but it’s simply not the kind of stuff that goes viral.
We expect Compass to be a different story.
Compass helps you visualize your Slack team’s communication. Unlike Kumu — where you start small, build up your data incrementally, and handle most calculations locally in your browser — Compass taps into a firehose of data the second you sign up and most calculations are handled server-side.
Compass may never reach the scale we’re anticipating, but if it does we want to be prepared. And if it goes viral we don’t want to be woken up in the middle of the night to put out fires. We have lives, and wives, and kids, and hobbies, and many other things we’d much rather be doing. Like sleeping. (Trying to, at least.)
So instead of attempting to build a system that should scale, we’re putting in some time upfront to design an any-scale system: a system that’s built to remove scale from the equation (or at least make it somebody else’s responsibility).
With that goal, we’ve been exploring two potential architectures on top of AWS:
The remainder of this post explores the trade-offs we’ve considered between these two architectures. If there are any big ones we’ve missed, please mention them in the comments!
As a bootstrapped startup, cost is a big one. Get it wrong and it can cripple you before you get out of the gate. Get it right and you’re off to sipping mai tais on the beach while you still look good in a bathing suit. (Or you could use that money productively to create jobs and grow the product. You’re the boss.)
With multi-tenant architectures, the cost to run the system is fixed. You’re paying a lot up front but the good news is each new customer you add drives down the marginal cost of adding the next one. Outside of customer support, adding new customers doesn’t really cost you anything.
With single-tenant architectures, the marginal cost of adding new customers never goes down. It’s fixed. Each new customer requires a new instance and each of those new instances has to be paid for. Worse than that, the cost per customer actually goes up! Larger teams need larger instances. While we might be able to support teams of 10 to 20 on a t2.nano, we’ll need a much larger instance to support teams with hundreds of members.
So — since multi-tenant lowers cost per customer — it’s the clear winner here, right?
Well… no. Not really.
Besides the cost of the underlying infrastructure, there’s also these things called humans. And they’re expensive.
The single-tenant architecture is a simpler architecture with fewer moving pieces. Simpler systems can be supported by smaller teams. And those teams can be made up of developers instead of dedicated sysadmins — it’s the exact same system you’re already running locally for development.
Which brings us to the next concern: parity.
Parity is the notion of similarity between environments. One of the major downsides of the multi-tenant architecture is the lack of parity between the environments we need to support:
Each one of those environments is complex on its own. Add them together and it’s clear why sysadmins get paid the big bucks.
You could argue that you don’t really need a staging environment. Because that’s what tests are for, right?
You could also argue that worrying about an on-premise enterprise version at this stage is premature. And in many cases you’d be right. But in Compass’s case, we’re juggling messages that contain sensitive information. And as such, we’ve already had requests for an on-premise version. Since enterprise customers are typically your largest and most loyal customers, we’d be foolish not to factor them into our initial planning.
Single-tenant is the clear winner here since it gives you parity across all environments and an easy path to enterprise. As a small team with limited resources, we think that’s pretty sweet.
With multi-tenant, deploys are typically all or nothing. Maintenance on multi-tenant systems can be scary. You push out a single update, and every customer is immediately on the new system. If you botch it you take down the entire system. Been there, done that. Not fun when it happens.
With single-tenant, maintenance is incremental. If you botch it, you typically only take down a single team. Instead of deploying a single app update, you’re deploying N app updates. Instead of migrating one database, you’re migrating N databases. On the surface level it sounds like this would create more work for you, but since the systems are isolated and identical most of that work can be automated. All you need is a bit of tooling to orchestrate the updates.
A beautiful side effect of single-tenant maintenance is that you get incremental rollouts and targeted beta releases for free. No need to mess around with load balancers or juggle internal feature flags.
Both architectures offer their own form of resilience.
Multi-tenant creates resilience at the team level. Each team is serviced by multiple instances, spread across multiple regions/zones, and hosted behind load balancers. A team is unlikely to experience issues unless there is a system-wide outage.
Single-tenant creates resilience at the system level. Outside of DDOS attacks at the DNS level there are very few ways to take down the entire system. A team may experience problems, but it’s unlikely those problems will extend beyond that single instance.
To account for disasters, we can throw in EBS backups, health checks, and a recovery instance that can stuff Slack events into a queue until a new server is provisioned. Now we’ve got a simple, resilient system at both the team and system level.
Plus, in general, a single angry customer is much easier to deal with than an angry mob. So chalk another one up for single-tenant here.
On Kumu, every project is backed by a separate CouchDB database. Over the years we’ve found this isolation extremely valuable. Sometimes we mess things up. Sometimes the customer messes things up. Regardless of who’s to blame, disaster recovery is much easier when each customer’s data is physically isolated, rather than simply being logically isolated within a single database. Database restorations become simple filesystem copies instead of fragile, complex database queries.
As far as I’m concerned, simple is the best kind of secure. Complex systems often give the illusion of security that isn’t truly there.
If everything is running locally on a single machine, and that machine is locked down with key-based SSH access, and the only other port that machine exposes is port 443 — then I’m not losing sleep at night worrying about security breaches.
Yes, the machine is exposed directly to the internet. But as long as any part of the system is exposed, direct exposure isn’t inherently less secure than indirect exposure. You can easily mess up either one.
If two systems have similar exposure and one is significantly simpler, I’ll go with the simpler system every time. Less surface area. Less complexity. Easier to audit. Sold.
As with most things, there’s no holy grail here. Both architectures have their tradeoffs and both are solid solutions for the right problems. I’ve always used multi-tenant architectures in the past but in this case it just doesn’t feel like the right tool for the job.
At the end of the day it’s our job as engineers to find that sweet spot at the intersection between priorities and constraints. For Compass, that sweet spot appears to be single-tenant.
There’s a strong argument to be made for multi-tenant too, but for now, a single instance per team looks like the quickest way to get up and running while minimizing scaling concerns. It’s also important to note that single-tenant wouldn’t even be an option if we were hoping to allow cross-team analysis. That said, here are the key advantages single-tenant provides for Compass:
So that’s where we’re at. At this point Compass is just a prototype but we’re hoping to build out the backend over the next few weeks. If you run an active Slack team and you’re interested in being a beta tester, let me know! You can reach me at ryan@kumu.io or @rymohr on Twitter.
Do you have experience running single-tenant architectures at scale? If so I’d love to hear about it in the comments below or the related post on HN!

Top highlight
When you hear metrics like “380% increase in upgrades from free to paid accounts”, you pay attention and raise a skeptical eyebrow.
That’s what we did.
And then, we dug in deep to figure out not just how one company did it, but to learn from the growing number of SaaS companies who are quietly using the same model today to reduce churn and grow revenue, without adding a single extra lead to the top of the funnel.
A few months ago, Wishpond, a Vancouver-based SaaS company serving over 100,000 business customers and counting, invested a single 10 day sprint in developing Wishpond Academy. This on-demand training hub on the Thinkific platform (Thinkific makes it easy to launch your own online courses) was designed for customers and prospective customers looking to learn not just what their product did, but how to do it. They already had a comprehensive support site for regular questions, but Academy was something new entirely.
Getting a customer to create an account is only half the battle. If a new customer doesn’t get real value out of your product — and quickly — they’re gone.
The goal was to bridge the gap between acquisition and activation with an engaging training experience designed to ensure that each new customer had the knowledge and confidence they needed to launch new campaigns — and hit their first WOW moment — in the shortest possible time.
Education and Training may be boring words, but Revenue is not.
The results were almost instant, and indisputable. Customers who had accessed Wishpond’s online training courses were upgrading from trial to paid plans at a rate 380% higher than customers not accessing the training.
Three hundred and eighty percent.
Wishpond is not the only Thinkific customer realizing similar results, but we were more interested in learning about how SaaS companies across the space are using education for growth, and what lessons can be learned from their success.
We reached out to 50 top SaaS companies to better understand how they are onboarding and educating their customers, from tiny startups to fast growing unicorns and enterprise solutions alike.
From looking at cases like Baremetrics’ use of education to help drop their churn by 68%, to companies like HubSpot opting to go the extra step with mandatory education as part of their onboarding, what we confirmed is that:
In between content marketing and support, there’s a whole category of education that only a few SaaS companies have fully unlocked.
As organizations, most of us are churning out a tonne of content. The problem we found, however, is how and when that content gets into the hands of the customer.
It turns out, that’s a detail significantly more important than you think.
“For Moz, educational content and helping marketers succeed has been at the forefront of our mission and the best way we’ve found to grow our community and our customer base” — Rand Fishkin, Founder, Moz
Most SaaS companies have customer education that falls into two key areas:
The analysis of leading companies reveals a 3rd category of customer education, one that a majority of SaaS companies have completely overlooked:
Proactive customer success training is delivered through online courses and on-demand training designed to get your new customers up to speed from acquisition to activation in as short as possible timeframe. It’s delivered proactively not reactively — BEFORE your customer realizes they have a problem they can’t figure out how to solve.
“There is an enormous gap between content marketing and customer support. At Unbounce, it’s been a huge opportunity for us to fill this gap and proactively educate customers on our platform after they sign up. We’ve created a customer training academy to add real value for customers.” — Gary Allen, Academy Lead, Unbounce
“Ultimately education breeds successful customers and success breeds loyalty.” — Sameer Dholakia, CEO, SendGrid
While content marketing education can be a long play, training as part of onboarding is a near instant one. Most companies already have a lot of the content that their customers are looking for, and think they’re doing a good job here. It’s just not delivered in the right place, at the right time.
“Customer Success is one of the secret ingredients to sustainable SaaS growth.” — Morgan Brown, Head of Growth, Qualaroo
(Don’t miss part 2 of this article: Putting Customer Success into Action)
Push vs. Pull:the subtle difference between frustrating and engaging your customers
Most education content is based on the customer needing to identify that they have a problem, and then seeking out the solution. They have to pull it, and it can be incredibly frustrating for those new to your platform.
Your support site is designed to quickly find answers to questions like “Where do I re-schedule this post to be delivered at a different time?” or “How do I change the owner on a shared folder?”
In order to get the most out of this type of support, your customers need to identify that they have a problem, they need to know the language to describe the problem, and then they need to search for the answer in your support forum or knowledge base.
These support resources are vital, but the challenge is that they’re designed primarily for customers who are already familiar and working with your system.
Conversely, customer success content and training is pushed to customers as the first step after they sign up, and is prominent throughout the system as the best available choice for learning both BEFORE they dive in, and as they progress through your product and encounter new features, or are ready to learn new functionality.
This type of education exists as courses, tutorial videos, and even hands-on training. And as it turns out, it’s not that difficult (or expensive) to deliver.
“Deliver education when you think your customers are looking for it” — Mada Seghete, Co-Founder, Branch Metrics
Customer success content answers questions like “I’m new, where should I start”, “What do I need to do to start my first campaign”, and “Tell me what I need to know about using the system to engage with my users”.
Proactive customer education brings customers fromsign-up to power user, without their needing to reach out for help.
“I think the most important part of a new user experience is quickly educating users on what your product does for them and how to get started. Focus on onboarding improves activation and retention, which are the most important metrics for growth.” — Ivan Kirigin, CEO, YesGraph
Companies like HubSpot, Vidyard, and Infusionsoft figured out the value of proactive customer training some time ago.
These companies not only deliver excellent, proactive customer success education, but they have identified it as so important that they’ve made it all but mandatory.
“The success of you and your team is so important to Infusionsoft that we won’t let you go at it alone.” — Clate Mask, CEO, Infusionsoft
With big-ticket services, the cost of each churned customer is high. By proactively educating their customers on their systems, they are doing everything they can to onboard customers as quickly as possible, without forcing them to ask for help.
“An educated customer is a capable customer. A capable customer will push the boundaries of what is possible with your product, forcing innovation, reference-ability and ultimately value to your bottom line.” — Michael Litt, Co-Founder & CEO, Vidyard
“Since they’re more educated, they are generally better customers that retain at higher rates.” — Sarah Bedrick, Certifications Program Manager, HubSpot
When was the last time you voluntarily chose to stop and ask for directions?Are you still making your customers do just that?
Groove looked to their new customer data when they set out to reduce their own churn. One key learning for them was that for customers who subsequently churned, they found that many of them had spent significantly longer than average on a specific task. For example, if it normally takes 30 seconds to integrate a Twitter account, a customer at higher risk of churn might have spent 2 or 3 minutes on that task.
Their customers were getting stuck, and they weren’t reaching out.They were leaving instead.
“Customer education is an incredibly valuable onboarding tool for us, and one of the biggest wins we’ve had in improving the way we do it has come with looking closely at the trends in our support tickets. We studied the questions that were being asked most often, and incorporated the answers into our customer education flow. Not only did we reduce support tickets, but engagement continues to be huge for that content” — Alex Turnbull, CEO & Founder, Groove
Ask your customer support leadwhat the top inquiries from new customers are this week:If they can give you a list, you’ve just found your 1st training opportunities.
“Our biggest tip would be to learn from your customer.” — Sara Rosenfeld, Product Marketing, Wave Apps
Are you silent and just watch — all the way to the point of them hitting publish, launching a campaign, or running a report; or do you guide them through the process?
Do you give them a walk-through up-front, or ask what they want to accomplish first, and start there with your tips? Do you start with a blank slate, or is it easier for them to grasp if you pull up a demo with some live content and data?
Sound familiar?
Leading SaaS companies are delivering that same hands-on experience to every single new customer — hundreds & even thousands of times over, without the need for 1 on 1 resources.
“Product-centric customer education is a powerful tool to increase customer satisfaction and retention, as customers learn to get more value out of the products they buy from you.” — Gerardo A Dada, VP Product Marketing and Strategy, SolarWinds

Joseph Chen- 產品經理喬 PM Joe
Aug 13, 2020·21 min read
我這輩子唯一學不會的事情就是放棄！七輪面試 + 一個艱難作業。估值60億美金的知名外商 SaaS 設計平台公司釋出了產品負責人職位，而我最後竟然是拿到了Offer的那一位!
面對競爭者畢業於常春藤大學 (Stanford, UC Berkeley, Princeton..etc.)、甚至擁有在百大企業 Google、Airbnb、Amazon、百度、抖音、騰訊、阿里巴巴的多年工作經驗，我是如何脫穎而出？
而到最終關，我與其他四位學經歷都超級優秀的候選人競爭相比，我具體是用什麼策略，而成為最後被選中的那一位呢？
我有七年以上產品經理經驗，三年帶團隊經驗。本篇文章分享自己成功面試上世界頂尖獨角獸外商的 #面試準備過程，內容顆粒度會細到面對各種面試題目的應答策略與框架。希望能幫助任何產品新鮮人，或正想要轉換跑道的朋友。
面試是非常主觀的事情，很可能失敗或者是拿到 Offer 後不滿意。但是最重要的是每一次的面試經驗，都要逼迫自己從中學習到失敗經驗，讓自己下一次的面試表現更好。我過去被獵頭/HR主動獵了三次，相信與每次都把握面試機會來優化自己的面試策略有關。
不要丟一份通用型履歷到你非常想要的公司！通用型履歷就是：然後所有公司不管 JD 怎麼寫，你的履歷都寫一樣內容。我在過去的公司面試過超過 200 位候選人 (產品經理居多)，對於這部分特別有感。假設今天是面試電子商務的職位，候選人的履歷卻大部分強調自己之前做相機的工作經歷，這部分可能在 HR Screening 就被刷掉了，到不了業務負責人的手上。
所以我自己在找機會時，也特別注意這部分。成功率高的履歷，是必須詳細閱讀目標公司職位的JD，仔細去思考自己是否有相關經歷，找出自己的優勢點，並能夠在自己的履歷中呈現，進而得到面試機會的。
履歷中每一段經歷沒有必要所有完成的事項都寫上，畢竟從履歷中的內容就已經開始是面試環節了，公司會開始評斷你這個人。過於繁雜沒有秩序的履歷會被認定是沒有邏輯，而且很有可能被定位為沒有辦法把控內容的質量。
透過獵頭或者認識的人內推，往往會是能夠快速通過 HR 那關的方式。為什麼呢？如果是透過自己投遞簡歷到公司網站，HR必須從大量信件中找到你，這是第一個難關。再來就是，沒有人認識你！你要如何在沒有人給予簡短介紹或者說幾句跟你合作的經驗的情況下，快速獲得面試機會？相對來說很難！除非真的特別優秀！但其實，在反饋時間來說，自己投也是慢很多！
有獵頭找上門，即便機會不是想要的，也記得保留這個人脈。職場上或者學生時期所認識的人，盡量不要樹敵！因為獵頭有時甚至會握有不公開招聘的高級職位，可以請他們推薦。以及同領域的人在未來職場上很可能會在你想要的公司工作，這時候如果可以請他們內推，你真的會省很多力氣！畢竟連 HR 都沒看上你，更沒面試機會了。職場上有貴人真的很重要。
與獵頭相處是一套哲學，你要懂得進退。因為常常發生的是，獵頭會想盡辦法利用你挖出更多有效人脈，讓他可以去繼續挖。這情況很常發生在你是經歷很吻合的候選人，但是沒在看機會。Again, 跟獵頭的關係是一套哲學。
在面試的時候，中心思想就是要從 HR 身上挖取到更多有利於面試的資訊。順道一提：與 HR 相處時，基本做人道理都要有，不要一副自己高高在上一定會被面上的感覺 (別忘了肯定有其他競爭者，你不是唯一，時時刻刻保持謙卑)。更千萬不要忘記 HR 也是有權利決定要不要雇用你的。有些公司的 HR 甚至有非常大的權力，即使業務都過關了，HR 覺得溝通能力不行、領導能力不行，你就是會被刷掉。
(一) 跟 HR 明確面試流程，有幾關？大體上會跟哪些面試官進行面試？
(二) 每位面試官的面試看中的點是什麼？他們的地雷誤區是什麼？
(三) 盡力獲取每位面試官的名字與頭銜，在報章媒體或內容平台搜尋他們，仔細聽他們的想法與著重點，以便制定面試策略。更厲害的就是，找到面試官的專業社交平台帳號，仔細研究他們最近在關注什麼。
(四) 這個職位看中更哪些能力？(專業技能中的哪一塊？)
(五) 公司文化要熟讀！讓自己在面試階段看起來就是個 perfect match。
面試的目的很單純，就是要讓每一位面試官都喜歡自己。你很難是產品經理全才，如何在面試中對答說出面試官想聽的就是核心。對自己的專業能力滿意、認為自己是個軟硬實力都兼具且適合剛職位的候選人。值得一提的是：許多很優秀的人往往敗於軟實力 (溝通能力、團隊協作能力)，因為被認為個性太獨來獨往，給人感覺不喜歡團隊合作。面試時真的要展現自己很開放以及喜歡團隊合作的心態啊！
首先談談面試基本題：• Tell me about yourself. (介紹下你自己。) • Why do you want to work here? (為什麼想在這公司工作？)• Why do we have to hire you? (我們為什麼要雇用你？)• What is your biggest weakness? (你最大的弱點是什麼？)• What is your biggest strength? (你最大的優點是什麼？)• If we don’t hire you, what could be the reason? (如果我們不雇用你，可能會是因為什麼原因呢？)• Where do you see yourself in 5 years? (你覺得你五年內如何發展？)
再來是專業題，分析了 FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) 的PM面試，歸總了產品經理的面試基本上會問到以下問題類別：
• 產品策略 (Product Strategy)• 產品設計 (Product Design)• 數據定義 (Metric Definition)• 數據變化 (Metric Change)• 估算題 (Estimation)• 技術解釋 (Technical Explanation)• 情境題 (Behavioral Question)
→ 絕對不是人人都可以當產品經理，因為以上題目真的千奇百怪超級困難，針對每個題種發展出屬於自己的答題框架非常重要，面試以及夠緊張了，沒有準備的情況下要如何給出 Structured Answers。
基本上最安全的方式就是所有面試題目類型都做準備，畢竟它們也是環環相扣彼此影響的。但如果硬要做準備策略調整，技術解釋題可以視面試公司的情況做時間上的分配調整(建議先探聽清楚比重，最好先上 Glassdoor，或者利用人脈挖出越多情報越好)。
(一) 針對產品策略問題 (Product Strategy)
例題：請提升 Facebook 收入
這樣的題目沒有明確告訴你要設計什麼功能，而是給你一個要提升的業務指標。所以我個人理解，這個題目其實是：建立出一個可以基於的產品策略，然後進行一個產品設計功能，演示給面試官看。
(面試官要看的是你的思考方式，而不是只追求答案。千萬不要一開始就只給答案，這是個 red flag (警示)，面試官很可能因此就覺得你是個不思考的候選人，而放棄你)
1.確認公司情況
(1) 現況：Facebook 變現的手法是廣告變現。(2) 核心數據 LTV, ARPU → 人均廣告展示數、人均廣告點擊率影響收入。
2.列下解法
(1) 建立在用戶旅程中與收入最相關的架構：
用戶在訊息流瀏覽 → 看到廣告 → 點擊廣告
→ 以上的架構就可以是 產品設計基於的策略，我們產出的策略就是優化每一個節點的轉化率 ；
(2) 腦爆解法 (列出兩個做示範)：A. 優化廣告展示數：提升日人均看到的廣告數 → 加更多廣告位B. 優化點擊廣告率：優化廣告推薦演算法
3.討論解法
(1) 加更多廣告位(2) 優化廣告推薦演算法
→ 可以使用 ICE框架來判斷優先級：
✔ Impact (影響): 這個解法對於業務指標的達成成績
✔ Confidence (信心): 自己是否有信心這個影響是真的可以成真的？(基於市場競品的激烈競爭)
✔ Ease (成本): 這個解法的開發成本為何？(客戶端/服務端/…..)
→ 加更多廣告位：可能導致更打擾用戶體驗，導致留存下降。雖然開發成本低，但是影響過於負面，所以優先級低。
→ 優化廣告推薦演算法：涉及到ML機械學習 (Machine Learning) 的話不確定性通常都很高，前期與開發的溝通成本也會高，但是如果能提升個性化廣告推薦演算法。影響相當高，雖然開發成本也高，但我認為這是一個必然持續該投入成本的方向。
4.結論
(1) 產品策略是：
用戶瀏覽 → 廣告展示數 → 廣告點擊率
基於這樣的架構，思考兩個轉化率要使用怎樣的產品設計來優化。
(2) 推薦解法是：優化廣告推薦演算法
(3) 權衡與風險： Machine Learning 的不可預測性非常高，排期難以預測
(4) 衡量成功指標：人均廣告展示數、人均廣告點擊率、LTV、ARPU
LTV (Life-time Value): 生命週期價值ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): 用戶平均價值
以上就是我個人在回答產品策略題時，通常會跟面試官走過的思路。
(二) 針對產品設計問題 (Product Design)
類型：新功能優化、既有功能優化、挑選最喜歡/最討厭的產品進行優化
例題：請替 Facebook 設計電影功能
針對本類題型，特別推薦使用 BUS框架 來進行思考。(公司情況 > 分析用戶 > 設計解法)
相對而言是相同有系統的，而且在緊張的情況下也比較不會過於慌。
(1) 確認公司情況 (Business)
A. 公司宗旨：Facebook 的目的把人們的距離縮到最短，讓彼此隨時可以聯繫感情。
B. 技術情況：Facebook 的最大優勢在於它具有人與人之間的社交關係鏈的數據。
C. 市場情形：(a) 解釋自己認為的電影就是影片。而在現在市場上的PGC影片類競品包含 Netflix, Hulu, Amazon 等等，面向UGC的影片類競品包含 YouTube等等。
(b) 為了做出具備市場獨有性的產品，可考慮結合 Facebook 的社交關係鏈優勢，去設計出電影相關功能。
→ 談完公司情況後，可以跟面試官說自己認為做電影就是在做影片 (把自己如此認為的原因與對方說)，並且確認：有沒有任何期望自己更專注的數據指標 (收入/用戶參與率等等)。如果沒有，自己會專注於某數據，因為xxx。把自己的思路 (原因/結果都明確告知)。
(2) 分析用戶 (User)
→ 若是談到電影，可很快的區分為生產側與消費側：
✔ 生產側 (創造者，Creator)A. 專業用戶：(a) 好萊屋等級的專業用戶(b) KOL/網紅等等
B. 一般用戶：(a) 高頻率使用(b) 低頻率使用
✔ 消費側 (觀看者，Viewer)A. 高頻觀看者B. 低頻觀看者
→ 我個人會選擇生產側的一般用戶，除了一般用戶的基數比較大，對於影響因為現在 Facebook 的導航列已經有獨立出一個給影片觀看功能 (2020/ 07)，所以功能整體已經相對完善。但是一般用戶創造影片還是沒有與社交有任何結合。
✔ 生產側一般用戶的痛點：
(1) 做影片是個很孤單的體驗(2) 不知道自己做的影片他人是否喜歡(3) 自己可能只具備做影片的其中一個技巧，缺乏其他的技巧
→ 我選擇做影片是個很孤單的體驗，因為做影片是最多用戶會接觸到的場景，對業務指標影響較大。其他兩者是基於做完影片後，才會延伸出的需求。
(3) 設計解法 (Solution)
A. 製作影片時，可以邀請他人一起進行 (熟人使用Tag功能進行; 陌生人會出現在 Discover 模塊讓其加入)B. 在 Facebook Event功能中，定制化一個種類讓做影片的人群聚C. 每當家人與親密朋友間的紀念日時，把他們從小到大的回憶基於一個影片模板，讓自己與他們一起編輯這個影片。
→ 可以使用 ICE框架來判斷優先級：
✔ Impact (影響): 這個解法對於業務指標的達成成績
✔ Confidence (信心): 自己是否有信心這個影響是真的可以成真的？(基於市場競品的激烈競爭)
✔ Ease (成本): 這個解法的開發成本為何？(客戶端/服務端/…..)
→ 利用框架判斷出優先級後，針對選出的解法還要給出以下資訊：
✔ Trade-off (權衡之處): 很難有解法是完美的。這個解法有哪些需權衡的地方？妥協了什麼？造成哪些影響？這些都要思考清楚。
✔ Risk Management (風險管理): 這個解法有風險嗎？例如說隱私問題？
✔ 衡量成功的數據指標？可以不只一個指標，但你說出一個指標後就要說出為什麼你認為要使用這個指標？(人均月加好友數/使用過功能後的留存)
以上就是我個人在回答產品設計題時，通常會跟面試官走過的思路。
(三) 針對數據定義問題 (Metric Definition)
例題：請替 Facebook 定義數據指標
1. Goal: 今年的業務目標是什麼？ — 假設是收入。
2. Action: 找出與業務目標相關在應用內的行為 — 觀看廣告
3. Metric: 根據行為去定義相關數據 —(1) 業務關鍵數據：人均廣告展示次數、人均廣告點擊次數、人均廣告點擊率、廣告主下廣告總量等等(2) 整體關鍵數據：LTV、ARPU 等等
4. Evaluation: 衡量以上數據是否夠精確或能幫助進行產品決策？ — 每個數據都要可以進行用戶分群各自監測數據：分市場、分新老用戶、分高低使用頻率用戶等等。
(四) 針對數據變化問題 (Metric Change)
例題：Facebook DAU下跌30%，怎麼辦？
1. 確認問題的範圍與定義 — 縮小問題範圍
(1) Where — 發生在哪個市場？還是全部市場？(2) When — 是一直發生？還是只發生在特定時間區段？(3) What — 是在哪個平台發生？Web端？iOS/Android？是特定版本？(4) Who — 是否是特定的用戶群體受到影響而已？還是整體？
2. 追根究底找出根本問題 (Root Cause)
(1) 內部問題 (Internal)A. 數據精準度 (Data Accuracy)：數據平台是否精準？數據歸因是否正常？
B. 近日版本上線功能品質：新版功能品質不佳？上線的素材未考慮到文化、宗教造成反彈或抵制？效果不符合用戶期待？
C. 穩定性問題 (Stability)：Crash 與 Bug 是否在開發階段沒有測試出呢？
(2) 外部問題 (External)A. 用戶習慣改變 (使用裝置、節慶、市場需求降低、重大疾病影響等等)B. 季節性變化 (例如：學生大部分暑假跟寒假較活躍，但開學後則降低活躍)C. 第三方問題 (服務端問題[AWS, Azure 維護]、數據平台故障等等)D. 獲取用戶途徑出問題 (Google廣告推薦演算法大變、ASO關鍵字被搶等等)E. 出現特別強大的競爭對手F. 社會變化(例肺炎)、政府政策 (例印度禁止59款大陸應用)、戰爭等等
3. 結論 (Summary)綜合上述給出結論：針對 Facebook DAU下跌30%的情況，首要先定義問題範圍、然後從內部與外部原因去定位問題，進而找出根本原因，進行修正。
(五) 針對估算題
這類題目面試官自己也不知道正確答案，他只是想要看你如何分析問題，進而有一個思路去得到一個答案。千萬不要直接給一個數字，就算你知道答案
例題：YouTube每日收入多少？
1. Clarify 釐清問題
(1) 公司目前情況：YouTube 目前的商業模式有訂閱與廣告變現
(2) 確認分析目標：主動詢問面試官本題是否可以只考慮廣告變現(表現出自己的理解，並且假設自己不是特別懂訂閱，可以再有知識盲區的情況下回答)
(3) 確認分析地點：主動詢問面試官是否可以只考慮美國？或者要考慮全世界？
2. Map out calculation 公式化問題
美國廣告日收入 = DAU(美國) * 人均廣告觀看次數 * 廣告展示率 * 單個廣告觀看平均盈利
* DAU = Daily Active User (日活躍用戶)
3. Round number 使用好估算的數字
(1) 美國DAU ：
假設美國總人口為 300M (3億)，我們只考慮0–80歲的人，且人口均勻分佈：
年齡 0–20: 300M * (2/8) * 0% (20歲以下不能用 YouTube)
年齡 20–30: 300M * (1/8) * 100% = 37.5M
100%代表全體會用YouTube
年齡 30–40: 300M * (1/8) * 100% = 37.5M
100%代表全體會用YouTube
年齡 40–60: 300M * (2/8) * 50% = 37.5M
50%代表一半的人會用YouTube
年齡 60–80:300M * (2/8) * 50% = 37.5M
50%代表一半的人會用YouTube
→預估出來 150M 為每天美國日活躍的用戶數。
(2) 人均廣告觀看次數：A.聽音樂的用戶可能一天會看20個以上的影片；B.看影片的用乎可能一天只會看1個影片；
→ 基於這種情況，可預估每天人均看10個影片。
(3) 廣告成功展示率：不可能每個用戶看影片時，都能成功拉到廣告展示。 → 所以初估 50% 為廣告成功展示率。
(4) 單個廣告平均盈利：用戶每看一個廣告，可以盈利多少 → 在此可以粗估為 0.01 USD。
美國廣告日收入 = DAU(美國) * 人均廣告觀看次數 * 廣告展示率
→ 150M * 10 * 50% * 0.01= 7.5M (USD)
4. Summary 簡短給結論，並思考估算數字合理性，並與面試官確認是否有任何疑慮。以上的回答是否是他可以接受的呢？
(六) 針對技術解釋題
例題：網路是怎麼運作的？ (常考題)
1. Clarify 確認問題定義網路可以是點對點之間的數據傳遞技術，也可以是區塊鏈(Blockchain)相關技術。比較常見的情況是：在瀏覽器 (Browser) 輸入一串 URL 後獲得搜尋結果。與面試官確認往這方向深入討論是否可以呢？
這樣主動定方向的好處是，可以規避自己不熟悉的技術盲區，通常面試官會樂意接受自己主動去定義方向。但也可能會有面試官拒絕此方向的可能性。
2. Step-by-Step 一步一步解釋
現場面試如果有白板或者任何服務工具，可以劃下視覺化流程 (服務端與客戶端交互)，方便與面試官溝通。
(1) 角色介紹
A. 客戶端 (Client-end):用戶使用來傳輸 URL 的裝置，可以是手機或者電腦(PC/Macbook)。
B. 服務端 (Server end):網路數據展示的地方，或者說存儲之地。
C. DNS Resolver (Domain Name System):當客戶端傳出 URL 時，DNS 會解析這 URL，將其變為電腦可閱讀的 IP 地址 (Internet Protocol Address)。可以理解為，URL 是為了讓人類理解的提升可讀性，並方便資訊互相傳遞。但是 IP地址 是獨立的，方便讓電腦進行處理。
D. 網路 (Internet)客戶端與服務端彼此間的互動都透過網路，包含 IP地址與數據傳遞等等。可以理解為網路是個媒介。
(2) 實際行為
A. 當客戶端在瀏覽器上輸入一個 URL，則這個 URL 會先被 DNS Resolver 解析為 IP 地址。
B. IP 地址透過網路向服務端發出查詢請求。
C. 服務端接受 IP地址 查詢請求。
D. 查詢結果完成後，服務端透過網路將結果回傳至客戶端，進行前端視覺呈現。
也可使用譬喻法輔助：其實網路就像是透過電話簿打電話的概念 —
• 客戶端像是撥電方，撥電方想打電話給 Joseph，在電話輸入 Joseph 播出。• DNS就像是電話簿，Joseph 必須透過 DNS 被解析為一個電話號碼。• 電信服務像是網路，這個撥出需求透過電信服務撥出需求給 Joseph。• 接聽方像是服務端，電信服務送來的接聽需求，接了就透過電信服務告知撥電方，並且接通開始對談
3. 結論簡短把剛剛說的話用總結的方式再說一次，呈現出自己溝通技巧以及總結能力：當我收入 URL，DNS會剖析它成為 IP 地址，透過網路跟服務端進行交互，如果有結果，就會透過網路返回至客戶端，也就是我的裝置。
(七) 針對情境題
切記 STAR 法則，確保自己的回答是有架構的：1. Situation: 任務的場景2. Task: 明確說出被給予的任務3. Action: 執行的事項4. Result: 執行的結果、學習到的事物
例題：說明職涯中與同事發生衝突的經驗？
1. Situation: 若干年前，修圖產品在日本市場要開發美顏功能
2. Task: 開發不懂為什麼要花大量資源做這件事，對此任務很抗拒
3. Action:(1) 理解開發為何這樣思考：他不理解日本市場、也不懂美顏效果背後可以帶來的數據意義 (留存提升、核心功能帶來當時的市場差異)。
(2) 利用支持數據來說服開發：說明用戶調研數據、市場特性，日本人群體特別在乎大家一樣，過於壓抑其實大家在社交媒體常常批評彼此，期望在社交媒體是完美的傾向。
(3) A/B Test 可驗證：核心數據指標為 — 與開發明確說明，A/B實驗可以客觀去說明自己的看法，如果真的是負面效果，也可以上線之後撤下。使用過美顏功能的次週留存，以及人均日開啟次數等等。
4. Result:(1) 結果：美顏效果在日本上線後，非常明顯造成數據正面影響。
(2) 省思：往後在需求評審會上，多多跟團隊人員說明 OSM (Objective目的、Strategy策略、Measurement衡量指標)，讓團隊對於達成目標的向心力也可以更強烈。
以上七種產品經理面試中會遇到的題型，都不是特別簡單。所以練習真的很重要！不要裸面 (沒準備就面試)，會留下黑歷史給企業的資料庫。我個人練習花了至少三個週末，而且週末是全天在練習，
我個人面試練習方式如下：
✔ 針對每一種題型默寫框架，練習直到可以說出每一個題型的框架，這行為必須要跟呼吸一樣自然。我個人每一個框架都至少默寫了60次。
✔ 一定要進行模擬面試，無論是否有對象可以跟你一起！每一種題型都一定要逼自己可以回答的非常順。心態上要調整，不要想要一步登天。我也是練習了三個週末，才在面試中表現比較好。
1. 面試很看緣分，有時失敗了不是你的錯，而是面試官跟你對談的氣氛本身已經不對了 (換個角度想，你避免了可能不適合你的工作環境)。但是你一定要從每一次的面試中學到東西，避免下次再犯。
2. 再次強調：盡量獲得面試官的資訊 (尤其是 LinkedIn)，並且研究每一位面試官，去定製化應答策略絕對有助於通過面試。
3. 多去思考自身優劣勢，以及 JD 上提及的要求。面試過程中要規避自己的弱勢，多主動出擊掌握話題，凸顯自己的優勢。記得面試的目的只有一個：要讓面試官喜歡自己、認可自己！

This post is part of our series covering the SaaS industry. You can follow us on our Point Nine Capital Medium channel.
For SaaS companies 2004–2008 basically looked like this:
Your SaaS product was basically a web / desktop client only and in terms of distribution (I won’t talk about direct sales in this post) your job consisted in having a good SEO / SEM + good PR (= being featured in online media) to drive traffic to your homepage and then to convert the visitors to your product (this is why homepage conversion was so important and so documented back then).
Then, by 2008, mobile and social media arrived. From that point, things started to change both for product and distribution:
This is how the situation looks like now.
A SaaS product didn’t become a sum of many apps / plugins. No. What I mean here is that the concept of the SaaS product is shifting from a full-featured web client only to a coherent ecosystem of internal apps, plugins, APIs and soon bots.
[EDIT] I’ve been asked to give examples of startups illustrating this trend so here you go.
Intercom:
Clearbit:
[Edit 2] interesting comment I got on Quibb:
From Philip Branning:
“The conclusion is correct — if you don’t have an API, you don’t have a product. But the idea that saas products are sprouting new endpoints is somewhat misleading. It’s not a soup, most everything is built hierarchically on top of the API.”
My answer:
Definitely agree. In terms of “architecture” everything is built on top of your API. I was more speaking from the user point of view and how he perceives it. I wouldn’t compare it to a soup but more to a fancy buffet where he can chose what fits him more :-)

SaaS businesses have a great model — pay to acquire customers up front then reap the benefits over time through long-term subscription contracts. The downside of this is it’s usually very expensive to scale into a public company. Managing cash is vital for any growth company, but especially for high-growth SaaS companies where there are heavy investments in customer acquisition and product development. Given the questions from portfolio companies and other founders, I wanted to understand what is the cash lifecycle of precedent high-growth public SaaS companies? I looked at a group of almost 45 high-growth SaaS companies and charted their average cash positions over time — from initial fundraising to post IPO. I also stripped out secondary transactions in the private markets (where I could) so that it was apples to apples with regard to dollars going to company balance sheets. Take a look at the chart below which summarizes the average cash lifecycle of almost 45 companies.
SaaS Company Cash Lifecycle Averages
There is a lot of variation within this group — for example, Veeva, a vertical software company focused on the life sciences industry, raised only $7M in primary capital and at IPO had $53M on the balance sheet, implying they added roughly $45M of cash prior to IPO. On the other hand, Cloudera, a big data vendor (more info here), raised almost $700M in primary capital and had $255M on their balance sheet at IPO, implying they burned through over $400M.
As you can see, it takes on average~10 years to get public and SaaS businesses burn through almost $100M. Companies want a buffer of cash so they raise on average almost $150M in primary capital and debt. Interestingly, the total average amount of equity and debt raised from the group is the same as the average IPO size, which is quite a coincidence. Given there are sometimes secondary components of IPOs, debt paydown (most of these companies didn’t have any debt) and other expenses, the average net increase in cash from an IPO is $121M, and companies end up with almost $175M on their balance sheets.
Given the large SaaS market opportunity and the many billions of dollars being invested to capture it, I expect we see these numbers get even bigger over time.

Before you jump in the comment section with your (Tesla) flamethrower to burn my “clickbait title”, let me share some context. Since I’m covering the rise of alternatives to VC funding in the SaaS industry, I’ve discussed with several people who are thinking about creating such financing solutions. What strikes me during these conversations (almost every time), is how bootstrappers are considered a homogenous category of founders, when in fact it’s much more nuanced than that.
I have the privilege to interact with some of them, and I definitely see very different profiles of founders who have a variety of financing needs. This is what I wanted to share in this article. I’m well aware that you cannot put people in boxes, and that categories are often more fluid than strict.
My point is to show that the term “bootstrapper” should be nuanced as it covers very different types of founders. If you want to serve their needs, you must consider this variety.
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
I meet many founders who know that they want to bootstrap their company and are not interested in VC money. They are well aware of the constraints of both models (very educated about this topic) and want to build profitable SaaS companies rather than hyper-growth startups. Growth speed is not their primary focus, revenue is. What they privilege, above all, is freedom and total control over their company.
Most of their financing needs won’t happen at the beginning to build their product from the ground up, but later once their company is running. At that stage, they’ll often need financing options to finance their cash flow without sacrificing equity (such as debt).
These founders are the opposite of the previous ones: they are generally not against VC money and can choose either path (VC or bootstrap). Their choice will largely depend on how their company develops. If they manage to generate an impressive growth or feel the opportunity to build a “VC compatible” company at one point, they won’t hesitate to go out of the bootstrap path and raise money with VCs. If it’s not the case, they’ll continue to operate a lean / profitable business.
As the SaaS industry is getting mature, there is an increasing number of experienced founders, (who have built VC backed companies) who choose to bootstrap their next startup. They have experienced the VC model and often saw the constraints inherent to this model: less control, fewer possibilities to do “things differently”, frictions with the investors (or the other co-founders) when the company doesn’t grow fast enough, etc.
Since these founders are experienced, they often have a good network of business angels behind them ready to finance their new company. They won’t “technically” bootstrap, but instead, raise money from business angels with terms giving them more flexibility. I believe these founders will have a significant impact on the rise of alternatives to VCs (they will pave the way to new models).
These bootstrappers are often developers who want to create and sell a tool, but don’t want to build a company. What they enjoy is to focus on the product, but not to hire and manage people. I talked to several of them who value operational support, like sales or marketing, above all. For them, operational support is almost as important as the financial aspect, because it enables them to focus on what they love (building a product and not run sales & marketing).
As a conclusion, I want to insist on the fact that these categories are not strict, but fluid ones (a solopreneur can decide to build a VC backed company at one point). As you can see from my descriptions, founders have very different needs in terms of financing and operational support. This is why I don’t expect a single “alternative to VC” model to dominate, but instead, different approaches adapted to these different segments to rise.

This post is part of our series covering the SaaS industry. You can find all our SaaS related stories on the P9 Capital Medium Channel.
Back when software was only “on-premise” the landscape consisted in huge players dominating the different verticals with a horizontal approach (Microsoft, SAP…). For the users there was no such thing as choosing “my software stack”.
Then internet penetration grew and the SaaS model started to make sense for businesses. The first big “SaaS” pure players got traction. They didn’t have an horizontal approach but rather a vertical one, covering many needs within this vertical.
Users started to have more choices.
As SaaS penetration grew (businesses of all sizes are ready to buy SaaS now) and as the technological barriers kept going down, many verticals saw an explosion of new players. These new startups very often focus on a more specific part of a vertical and offer products with better UX/UI than what the bigger players can do.
At that point users really had to start thinking about their SaaS stack and what they should use.
The main SaaS verticals are really getting crowded. From big players to medium / small ones and even “micro-SaaS” (e.g SaaS which are just ‘extensions’ / ‘plugins’ of bigger SaaS) people have, literally, the choice between hundreds / thousands of solutions.
And as people keep adding more and more SaaS in their stack the pains linked to software interconnection, data migration, stack management, workflow integration, experience customisation etc… keep growing as well.
So new hybrid products / new approaches are organically emerging to try to fill these gaps:
Vertical SaaS Hubs: they centralise the different SaaS of the user’s stack in order to manage them better. Focused on one vertical.
Examples: Lytics for the marketing vertical and elev.io for the support one
Unbundling APIs: they offer SaaS packaged as an API instead of a traditional finished product so the user can build its own UX according to its need.
Interesting approach to build “in-house” products (rather than reinventing the wheel) or complimentary products for your existing stack. I wrote a more detailed post about these products here.
Examples: Clearbits for the marketing vertical and supportive.io for the support one
Customer Data layer: segment.io is “the single hub to collect, manage and route your customer analytics data.” How it works: you send all your customer data to segment.io (through a javascript tag) which will route it back to the SaaS you’re using. By centralising your customer data in one layer you can migrate from one service to the other seamlessly or connect two software in different verticals with the same customer data.
Command & notification layer: when you have many apps in your stack, one problem is to be kept informed without logging in every time. Slack is this notification layer (you can plug your SaaS to Slack in order to receive notifications directly there). It also enables you to launch actions directly from the Slack interface. Like a command terminal. ”/hangout” to launch a Google hangout for example.
Transversal layers
Implications for SaaS makers
SaaS Hubs
As I said, as the stack keeps growing we’ll see more and more new hybrid products and approaches coming. So I’m expecting everything to evolve / change in the years to come.
And of course if you are a startup trying to solve these problems with innovative approaches, I would love to hear from you: clement@pointninecap.com

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-build-and-scale-your-saas-billing-solution-d6111b9ae253?source=search_post---------86,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
When you are building your Software as a Service (Saas) Minimum Viable Product (MVP), there is a lot of work that needs to be done. It can be difficult to balance this workload.
Oftentimes you are so focused on developing the product that you forget that you still need to sell it to people. This guide is meant to help you get your billing system off the ground to start making revenue, and show what you should be doing when you are ready to scale up.
Subscriptions are key to an effective billing strategy. The ability to charge a credit card on a recurring basis makes payment more efficient for both you and the customer.
To start selling subscriptions to your clients, you need:
If you don’t have the development cycles to do this, you will be stuck with a painful process of sending invoices manually, giving customers access manually, and adding friction to the on-boarding process.
For many SaaS companies, 100% of their customers come in through their Free trial system. — Lincoln Murphy
Offering free trials is considered by many to be one of the best ways to find early adopters of your SaaS.
When someone is given the opportunity to try your product before committing to a subscription, they are far more likely to become a regular customer.
It is good practice to treat your trial users with the same level of support and respect as you would your paying customers. Not only are they experiencing your product, they are also experiencing the quality of your service.
At the end of the day, you will end up integrating with an external system to handle these use cases. I highly recommend looking at Stripe because they have an excellent API to integrate with and a wide range of functionalities.
If you don’t want to develop the integration with Stripe yourself, take a look at Servicebot — It comes fully integrated with Stripe and has great Customer Relationship Management (CRM) functionality so you can better manage your customers and subscriptions from a dashboard.
During your early stages, Y Combinator founder Paul Graham says, “Do things that don’t scale.” Although this may sound counter-intuitive, this is the best way to grow your customer base before you begin to even think about scaling.
What scaling boils down to is automating the manual processes you’ve found to be effective at growing your startup.
When you’re ready to scale your billing solution, here are a few things to consider:
Automating the processes involved with billing — such as what happens when a user requests a trial, adds a funding source, or requests a cancellation — is one of the most important parts of scaling your billing solution.
You should first take a look at how you are currently doing your billing. Identify all the manual processes that currently are a part of your system, like restricting access if trials expire or reactivating accounts after they’ve been cancelled. Once you make that list you can start figuring out how much time is spent performing these and start iterating to reduce the most painful parts.
Another big part of automating your process is automating customer outreach based on their status in the billing system.
Customer outreach is key to converting customers from free trials to paid. When starting out, this process is mostly manual. Email people when they sign up, remind them when their trial is ending soon, or ask if they need help getting started.
This is not scalable — you need to eventually automate this process, and the best place to focus on is the billing side because so many steps are processed there
To ensure seamless communication between your system and the customer, it is important for your system to be tightly integrated with your billing.
One of the best ways to automate your businesses with minimum development effort is to integrate with third-parties who have already solved the problems you are facing.
Here are my favorites which I’m using for my own SaaS startup:
Stripe has become the staple of SaaS payment providers. With a developer-friendly API and constant new features, I (and countless others) feel it’s an obvious integration point.
Some of the features you can integrate with to automate more of your billing are:
There is much more you can do with Stripe, it should be up to you and your startup’s needs to determine how deep of an integration you need.
The staple of Intercom is the live chat widget that you embed on your site to enable communication with your customers. What many people don’t realize is that Intercom also provides an automation platform. If you integrate with Intercom, you can send customized messages to your customer based on what they do with your product.
This allows you to automate the communication with your customer so you don’t have to manually email anymore.
Servicebot comes out-of-the-box with a Stripe and Intercom integration. When a customer requests a free trial, Servicebot creates a new trialing subscription and customer in Stripe and a new user in Intercom, and directs them to a newly-created instance to use.
Intercom will send automated messages with the goal of converting to a paying user while Stripe will manage the subscription automatically.
A good first step to begin scaling is with automating your billing process. When it all comes together, you can connect parts of your business to a centralized location, as well as integrate it with third parties. The result of all this will be massive gains in productivity and efficiency that make the effort well worth it.
If you are interested in automating parts of your SaaS billing solution to do things like automate customer on-boarding and connecting business processes to your billing system, Let’s talk

https://medium.com/hackernoon/10-ui-ux-tips-for-developers-building-saas-apps-a1f3d74fce2b?source=search_post---------194,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
Getting a nice UI/UX on a SaaS app can be a real challenge for developers that know how to code, but struggle with design. I come from a software engineering background and while building https://checklyhq.com and blogging about it, I got a lot of questions about the UI framework I was using.
Spoiler: It’s just Bootstrap and some Vue.js 😱!
Here are my tips on getting the spit & shine on your UI. Regretfully, this will not be easy. Life is pain 😥. Entries are listed in order of (very) subjective importance.
All your developer synapses will be firing at this one. But sometimes the exact grid and the equal divisions on margin and font sizes just plain look bad.
Trust me , I studied Computer Sciences but also Art History 😇 (actually true!). On a 12px grid? Header looks better with a 13.7px margin? Do it. For my brand logo I tweaked the heights and widths of its various parts until it “felt right”, screw what the CSS says.
What works mathematically doesn’t always work optically. This video is also enlightening.
Using sites like Github, Travis, Stripe, Digital Ocean and even AWS should drive home one important lesson: Form based pages with tabs for sections and modals for the more complex and context sensitive interactions solve 99% of your issues. Even in 2018.
When trying to create a screen, I always fall back to this pattern. Rarely does it not solve the issue in the most simple and elegant way.
My number one tweak to my CSS is adding more white space where there already was quite some white space. White space solves a ton of your information ordering and visual hierarchy issues. On vertical white space you can go totally nuts because people don’t mind scrolling. Landing pages are a good example where you can ladle on the white space.
To not get lost in padding and margin jungle, use these simple rules.
Maybe this tip should have been at number one. Most of the advice above and the next tips in this post are solved in Twitter’s Bootstrap. Bootstrap gets a lot of crap about sites looking samey and still using jQuery.
These criticisms are easy to work around and they distract from the incredible amount of well made decisions in the framework due to its age and the experience of the people working on it for years.
So how to dodge jQuery if you’re building an SPA? Simple, just use something like (the awesome) https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/ if you are using Vue like me, or https://reactstrap.github.io/ if you’re in React land.
And how to dodge that canned Bootstrap look? Two options:
Other frameworks like Bulma, Semantic UI are also great and look shiny and “modern”. However, I found they rarely offer the same cross browser compatibility and robustness once you start prodding around. I might be wrong.
Many developers completely underestimate how much colour determines the identity of a site/brand/product.
Medium is a great example. It is mostly white, has a very specific font — more on that later — and a very recognisable green brand colour (#018f69). Used consistently, it makes Medium instantly recognisable among the zillion other blog sites. Then there is Heroku purple (#79589F), Amazon orange (#FF9900)…you get it.
Notice the pattern: A high visibility brand colour, coupled with a high contrast dark colour for text and a low contrast gray tone for borders, backgrounds etc.
Tweaking the colour pallet is so easy and immediately sets you apart from all the non-customized Bootstrap sites. Here’s is Checkly’s _colors.scss file. Notice the brand-primary and the various gray tones.
Not sure what colour fit with all the others? I found Adobe’s colour wheel a pretty handy tool to find nice complimentary hues.
Fonts are like music in films. They come with a ton of character, intent and emotion even when they are rarely in the main feature. A bog standard scene of a man walking along some grassy field can convey victory, sadness or suspense just based on the soundtrack. Similarly, your site can be serious, business-casual or leisurely just based on the font. Try sticking Comic Sans on a banking site and watch the world burn.
Google Fonts is hard to beat to start exploring how fonts resonate with what you are trying to say with your design. Small tip: use the “custom” text option to use any text that is relevant to your project.
For Checkly I chose a somewhat popular, non-free, font called Fakt Soft Pro. This font straddles the middle of the serious/leisure divide: exactly what I tend to express in Checkly’s product marketing: easy and friendly to use, but very serious in its application and problem solving ability.
In a typical SaaS site, you can never really have too much text. Not the long copy “War and Peace” type text, but more the right words in the right format dotted around your page.
This can get messy, so getting a “visual hierarchy” for all your text elements is SUPER important. And you have WAY more text elements than you think. Let’s break down a typical screen:
Rule of thumb #1: The larger a font, the skinnier it should be, the smaller the fatter.
Rule of thumb #2: HTML already has a visual hierarchy built in: h1 h2 h3 up to h6 and then p. For each element, change up at least two of the following attributes: font-size, font-weight, margin-bottom, letter-spacing, text-transform: uppercasein such a way that each element is at least different in two ways from its neighbours. Then just consistently use h1 to h6 . Also good for SEO!
So you thought I came up with these pages of wisdom by myself? Ha ha ha…sniff…No. I stole most of it from the insanely generous open style guides from some great SaaS companies. “Good artists copy; great artists steal” goes the (totally overused) saying…but REALLY great artists tell you whom to steal from! Here are my favourites:
MarvelApp
Heroku
Auth0
Need more research? Here is a site that collects all of ‘m Styleguide.io. It’s just nuts that you get to benefit from all the insights, learning and design talent at these companies. Learn, observe and maybe steal a little bit of inspiration and best practices.
Probably worth a full post, but making nice HTML emails is way harder than it should be. It’s HTML tables all the way down. No way around it. In general HTML emails fall into two categories:
For the first category, try to just use Mailchimp or similar services. You can add a bunch of personalised data items and it will serve you well. You will age less.
For the second category, I went on a wild goose chase to find the one framework or tool that allowed me to code HTML emails similar to how I build web app screens. This is what I ended up with:
In my Webstorm editor, this looks as follows:
The awesome thing is that it makes designing and editing these types of emails a lot easier. You can use the Pug logic functions like if statements together with partials and the mjml.io tags that hide all of the nested HTML tables.
At former jobs I had Real Designers™ and Real Front End Developers™ and we had people worrying about brand and copy and style guides. Most customer facing web stuff went through the following process:
Not all of these steps are always necessary for each iteration or each project. However, if you are somewhat handy with Sketch or a similar tool, I would recommend at least FULLY designing one or two screens before you start coding. Not ALL screens. Not every modal or interaction.
Just use the correct brand colours, the correct font and try to get the margins and white space right. Consider it your poor man’s version of the full blown UI style guides mentions earlier. Doing this will considerably cut down on your development time and give you a guideline for all other screens.

Top highlight
The majority of SaaS Investors uses the same metric frameworks and benchmarks to quickly assess the fundamentals of a SaaS company. This is why it can be interesting to know and understand them before you start fundraising.
If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
Preliminary comments:
1- These benchmarks and frameworks mostly apply to “VC compatible” SaaS. It doesn’t mean that you can’t build a fantastic SaaS business if you don’t hit these milestones nor that you need to fundraise to reach these numbers.
2- At early stage your metrics can fluctuate from one month to the other and some metrics (like LTV, churn or CAC) can take months / years before they stabilize (once you found your first product market fit). As a consequence be also cautious when you calculate the various ratios covered in the rest of the post when you’re really early stage.
3- If you want to understand better what it takes to raise depending your company stage I suggest you to read Christoph’s SaaS Napkin.
Here are 6 metric frameworks and benchmarks commonly used in the VC world.
When it comes to revenue growth the T2D3 framework is probably the most popular among SaaS VCs. T2D3 stands for ‘triple, triple, double, double, double” applied to your ‘end of the year’ ARR.
The rationale behind this framework is to show what it takes to grow your revenue from $1M — $2M to around $100M ARR in 6–7 years (which is what fast growing SaaS companies achieve).
Obviously the vast majority of SaaS startups will never reach this level of growth and that’s completely fine. But know that if you talk to “traditional” SaaS VCs, they’ll probably ask themselves: “Does this company have the potential to T2D3?”.
Bessemer also shared a revenue growth benchmark along those lines:
Growing your revenue fast is great but the majority of people in the SaaS industry knows that high churn and lack of account expansion can kill even the fastest growing companies. If you grow fast but don’t manage to keep your customers it’ll be extremely complicated to scale.
This is where the SaaS Quick Ratio comes in handy.
SaaS Quick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Churned MRR + Contraction MRR)
A SaaS Quick Ratio superior to 4 will excite VCs, between 2 and 4 a bit less but still ok and below 2 it won’t interest them.
Another very commonly used ratio is the LTV / CAC one. LTV stands for Life Time Value and CAC for Customer Acquisition Cost.
VCs expect that a customer generates at least 3 times what it cost you to acquire him (it’s a minimum).
As you can see on the diagram below, this ratio mixes many aspects from sales and marketing efficiency to your ability to keep users (linked to product quality and customer support). As a consequence there are many ways to optimize this ratio and just looking at the “raw result” won’t give you much insights.
Also worth mentioning in this section is the CAC Payback time by customer segment shared by Bessemer:
Churn is one of the most covered and analyzed SaaS metric on the internet so I won’t go into details here but just share this table by Tomasz Tunguz:
You can probably be even more demanding for the Enterprise segment and expect a 0–0.5% monthly customer churn (and you generally measure Enterprise churn on a yearly basis rather than monthy).
It’s a framework that I personally don’t use but it might be useful for later stage companies:
Quoting Brad Feld:
“The 40% rule is that your growth rate + your profit should add up to 40%. So, if you are growing at 20%, you should be generating a profit of 20%. If you are growing at 40%, you should be generating a 0% profit. If you are growing at 50%, you can lose 10%. If you are doing better than the 40% rule, that’s awesome.”
There’s no, to my knowledge at least, widely accepted product related metric frameworks or benchmarks simply because there’s a wide variety of SaaS products. Communication tools like Slack require a high percentage of daily active users while a security monitoring tool like Sqreen doesn’t (it keeps your back safe and will show up when it’s really important).
As Mamoon explains in his SaaSTr presentation, the most important is to find YOUR “North Star”:
To finish this section on product metrics, when you go in fundraising mode you probably won’t escape sharing user retention cohorts as well as daily / weekly / monthly active users.
Must read:
As usual don’t hesitate to leave a comment and to share with me the frameworks / benchmarks I missed.

Klaviyo is a marketing automation platform that lets ecommerce companies use their own data to power more personalized marketing. Sound a little boring? That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Klaviyo solves a very important, if not super glamorous, problem: helping growing companies grow even faster by making their marketing relevant.
The Boston-based startup has 80 employees today and is growing quickly. Back in 2016, Klaviyo raised a series A with the intention of using the capital to accelerate growth. Sure enough, they’ve tripled the business last year — but co-founders Ed Hallen and Andrew Bialecki never ended up needing to use the capital they raised, until it came time to put a down payment on their new 25,000 square foot office space in downtown Boston.
Klaviyo is a perfect example of efficient entrepreneurship — the fact that the company has sustained aggressive growth rates without relying on venture capital makes them an interesting case study. How did they do it?
So how do you build a high growth company without relying on venture capital? Make sure you build something people will pay you for. Ed Hallen and his co-founder Andrew Bialecki spent their first nine months experimenting with ideas about how to make email better. They quickly honed in on an opportunity: it was possible to make email more meaningful to the end user — if you used data about that end user to make the message more relevant. F500 companies were already marketing this way. But that kind of data-driven marketing wasn’t accessible to growth companies, because getting customer data on things like purchase history or website behavior synced with your marketing automation platform was a technical challenge, and therefore took a lot of time and money.
Bialecki and Hallen knew that if they could solve could make it easy to allow businesses to segment and user their data — solve the “how” — there were plenty of founders and marketers waiting to pay for it. So that’s what they did: focused on solving the hard engineering problems of creating reliable, real-time syncs between customer data and Klaviyo’s marketing platform. “Our strength was and is in engineering and we realized a lot of people were avoiding the hard problems, so we went at them head on,” says Bialecki. “Contrast that with solving a problem you know you can solve, but so can a lot of other people, and then hustling to find customers. We flipped that around — pick a problem with plenty of potential customers, but no clear way to solve it and then crack it.” Klaviyo built real time syncing for dozens of integrations, automatic error handling, data cleaning and they added a segmentation engine on top of the imported data with a simple interface so any marketer or founder can query their customer data. All of that is combined with a visual email builder and automation tools to eliminate most of the configuration growing companies had to do so they can focus on the creative and content of their messages.
Klaviyo decided from day one to offer reporting that went above and beyond the traditional email metrics everyone else in their space was using: they showed customers down to the penny how much money they made from email. This meant building attribution algorithms into their software, which they knew people were looking for. After that, the sales process became a no brainer. “Proving ROI was ridiculously easy,” says Hallen. “We charged on a monthly basis, so we could say to prospective customers, ‘If you pay us money, we’ll help you make more money on the backend. What do you have to lose?’.”
The early days of a startup are often marked by fitful experimentation to find the right path. This should be done with as small a team as possible. One or two people should be able to figure out what the company should be doing, before hiring a team.
Despite figuring out a formula that worked, Hallen and Bialecki didn’t let sales go to their head. They waited until they were on a million dollar run rate before hiring anyone else. That meant handling everything themselves and constantly looking for opportunities to automate: sales, development, and the customer support tickets that would fill their inboxes overnight. “If you start by doing everything yourself it’s easy to imagine doing more yourself,” says Hallen. Handling customer support themselves was particularly valuable. “Many of our best insights came from talking or working directly with customers,” according to Bialecki. “We probably would’ve been slower to realize what people wanted if we weren’t answering support emails and phone calls every day.”
If you follow the formula Bialecki and Hallen have outlined, you will — without a doubt — feel like you’ve waited too long to begin hiring. “Our business was growing so quickly we couldn’t keep up,” says Hallen. The company went from hiring its first employee in 2014 to its current state of 80 employees and growing in less than three years. But the worst thing to do when you realize you’re behind on hiring is to lower your bar, even subconsciously. You should expect the same passion and drive in your employees that you have yourself as a founder. “When hiring, never settle. Only hire people who will be as passionate as you,” advises Bialecki. “They’ll never let you down.”
The Klaviyo story seems like a storybook startup, but Hallen would make some decisions differently the next time around. As of this writing, Google returns two stories on the company, one in VentureBeat and a local tech website, both related to the $1.5M in seed funding the company raised in August of 2015. Lack of PR hasn’t hurt the company in terms of sales, but when you’re succeeding and trying to hire dozens of employees simultaneously, it makes life harder. “I loved our focus early on, but I wish we’d a bit more time to talking to people in Boston so we didn’t have to introduce people to Klaviyo cold when we started hiring,” says Bialecki. Neither he nor Hallen would trade off their relentless focus on product and customers in the early days for a more well-known brand today, but they both acknowledge that it can make recruiting more challenging.
Beyond branding, bootstrapping can lead to some close encounters of the furry kind. The company started in the Beehive, an underground co-working space sponsored by MIT in 2012–2013. Once they outgrew those digs they moved into the cheapest spot in Boston, which surprisingly turned out to be an office right off Boston Common. While it had an advantageous address, they also attracted some nocturnal visitors. A jar of almond butter lured in a family of raccoons who broke into the office one night. These days they are in nicer office space — no raccoons allowed.
Entrepreneurs need to be focused on solving a problem. This advice sounds trite, but Hallen says if you’re not solving a real problem, for lots of customers, repeatedly, anything else is a waste of time. That includes going to startup meetups and pitching VCs. “We didn’t do any incorporation paperwork until we had sales,” says Hallen. “When we signed our first customer we said let’s go figure this out.” The lesson learned? Focus on creating a great product that solves a real problem first, and the business will follow.

This piece first appeared on Tom Tunguz’s blog.
The purpose of a price is to tax usage of a product. That’s how companies generate revenue. Discovering how to tax a product properly is a perpetual challenge. It’s a moving target and so it requires an ongoing discovery process as the company and market evolve together. These are some mistakes I’ve noticed.
Complex or unintuitive pricing model
A good pricing model appears simple and logical to the customer. It may be complexbehind the scenes, with different prices for varying customer sizes, product complexity, and add ons, but the tax aligns itself to the customer’s perception ofROI clearly. Customers have their own unit of measure. Often for applications, it’s people — hence a pricing model by seats. Other times for infrastructure, it’s bytes for storage or cycles for compute.
But mixing these models by charging for a people-based product in units like bytes doesn’t work. A pricing model for Slack that charges based on the number of bytes sent by the team in a month works conceptually, but is intangible, hard to understand, and also impossible to predict the ultimate cost for the buyer.
Move to annual prepay too late
Salesforce popularized the annual prepay idea, and for good reason. Annual prepay generates cash flow to accelerate growth. Customers effectively lend the startup money to grow. It can be intimidating to push a customer toward annual prepay, or to demand it from an account executive, especially when a startup is young and the product immature. But it’s worth pushing as early as possible. Your startup will grow faster and need less capital to grow.
Employ static pricing
The optimal price for a subscription product is the one that maximizes the revenue on the supply/demand curve. But unlike the charts my Economics professor drew on the blackboard, startup price demand curves aren’t static. They change with time.
In fact, the marketing team exists to improve the demand curve by building a brand, developing reference customers, building strong return on investment case studies, building the lead funnel. As a startup becomes better known, the demand for the product increases, lifting the price demand curve, and with it the optimal price point. These effects can be dramatic.
Fail to embed concessions in the proposal
When selling to mid-market companies who buy software with purchase orders, not credit cards, startups will need to survive the procurement gauntlet. Procurement teams are often compensated on their success negotiating lower prices from vendors. Structuring proposals with this in mind is key to achieving the ultimate price target for your product.
Using the wrong price discovery questions
When asking a customer or potential customer how much they are willing to pay for a product, the customer will almost never be forthright. And for good reason — it’s against their economic interest to reveal their maximum willingness to pay.
It’s much easier to ask a customer to think about relative price. How much is the customer willing to pay compared to another product? In the sales SaaS world, buyers think of the cost of new tools as a function of the cost of a Salesforce seat. 10–20% of a Salesforce seat for a productivity tool seems reasonable. But is this new lead generation product equally as valuable as Salesforce?
Pricing is a moving target and so should be viewed as an ongoing product discovery process. Pricing should be re-evaluated regularly. Monthly, at the very beginning stages of commercialization, and then less frequently as the company approaches the local maximum when a product matures and the company establishes itself as a leader. Beware of the pitfalls above and you’ll reach that optimal pricing mechanism faster.

Having spent the better part of a decade building various businesses (B2B, B2C, e-commerce, digital goods, SaaS), I’ve found there are a number of indicators that give insight in to the health of a business in its earliest stages.
Let’s take a look at a few signs that your SaaS business isn’t doing so hot and what you can do to rescue it.
ARPU (average monthly revenue per user) is calculated by taking the monthly revenue of all your users and dividing by the total number of paying users. It’s the average amount you’re charging across all of your accounts.
A low ARPU translates to low margins. Even if we ignore technology costs associated with each account (such as server resources), the margins are almost reduced to $0 because of one thing: support.
Support work is a cancer to progress. It can (and often does) bury new businesses with a low ARPU as you’re generally short-staffed but have hundreds or thousands of low-paying users that demand high levels of support.
Let’s put it this way: would you rather support 1,000 customers paying $3/mo or 30 customers paying $100/mo?
When you consider that those $3/mo customers are usually the most demanding and least loyalcustomers you’ll ever have, you can see why having a low ARPU can quickly drive your business in to the ground.
So how do you resolve this? Charge more.
If you’re B2B and charging less than $20/mo for any plan, you’re just grossly undervaluing the service you provide. If you provide even an ounce of business value, you should be charging over $20/mo. End of story.
If users won’t pay more, then you’re not solving a big enough problem or aren’t solving it in a way that provides enough value.
If you’re B2C, there’s honestly very little you can do. Most B2C’s have a notoriously hard time breaking even. The stories of B2C products surviving (without being propped up by millions in VC funding) are few and far between.
Baremetrics’ ARPU is currently around $80–90. I’d like to have that closer to $150–200 as it means I’m able to offer better support and service to our customers and also means needing fewer support folks down the road.
Your revenue ceiling is the maximum amount of money you’re able to charge any given customer. It’s a great measuring stick of the value you’re product can bring to the table.
But why does “value” matter? Value has a direct correlation to revenue and churn.
High value = high revenue and low churn.
Low value = low revenue and high churn.
If you’re not able to charge anyone over $100/mo, you need to provide more value. As you provide more value (which businesses happily pay for), you’ll be able to charge more and grow your business faster.
This is also the reason unlimited plans are toxic. They instantly cap your revenue ceiling.
Baremetrics’ revenue ceiling is currently around $700/mo and with the things we’ve got in the pipeline, that will likely double in the coming 6 months or so.
Churn is the percentage of users (or revenue) that you lose each month. With a churn rate of 25% or higher, you’re bleeding out a fourth of your business every month. It’s absolutely unsustainable.
Businesses that have this high of a churn mask it with pretty high growth…which makes it appear that you aren’t doing so bad. As long as your growth route outpaces your churn, then your user counts and revenue will go up.
The problem is that growth rates plateau. You won’t have high growth rates for long and eventually the charts invert and within a few months you’ll be running in the red.
To decrease churn you provide more value and increase engagement. When you increase engagement with your product, you make it less disposable.
A couple of quick-fixes to increase engagement are to provide something like a daily/weekly/monthly email report (which conveys the value your product offers) or adding multi-user support (which gets a whole team using your product, making it hard to part ways with).
Baremetrics’ user churn is around 10% right now. It’s double what I want it to be, but it’s declining, so we’re headed in the right direction.
When you’ve been live and selling your product for a year and still haven’t broken a couple thousand bucks in recurring revenue, it’s likely you aren’t solving a real, substantial problem.
There are too many easier & more profitable pains to solve than to keep working on products that don’t solve real problems.
When you aren’t solving a real, substantial problem, it’s not the time to suck it up. There are too many easier and more profitable pains to solve.
If any of these “signs” hit home for you, it can feel pretty depressing. When you’ve invested huge amounts of time (and possibly money), coming to terms with the fact that it’s not working out is extremely demotivating.
But being honest with what is/isn’t working is the fastest way to get to where you want to be. Life’s too short to do things that don’t make an impact.
I’m not talking “solve world hunger” impact. I’m talking the type of impact that changes your world, the world of your family, your kids, your friends and the businesses your serve.
I worked on my past two SaaS products for over 3 years, many times pushing through what I just assumed was par for the course. And then I launched Baremetrics and realized how much better things could be. In less than 3 months I surpassed what took nearly 3 years to build up to with previous products.
It’s a tough decision to cut your losses and move on, but pushing through something that isn’t working doesn’t end well for you or your customers.

We all know the subscription model is invading the world. We subscribe to everything these days because that’s much easier than paying for each event, activity or transaction. We have subscription businesses in B2C as well as B2B. We have tons of examples for both. Some of the popular ones are Spotify and Netflix in B2C, Slack and Intercom in B2B.
In case of B2B particularly, the widespread thinking has been around customer engagement. Everyone wants to know if your customers are coming to your dashboard regularly or not. How much time are they spending there? What can you do to increase the time in-app because that’s tied to the outcome for the customer and you?
It’s all about to change with machine learning invading the world of SaaS. Most SaaS founders I have spoken to across India, Canada and the US in the last few months think of machine learning as a new layer they can add on top of their product and start generating some extra insights about their customers. Nobody I’ve spoken to recently seems to understand that their very product needs to be rethought because human expectations from software and machines are about to take a big leap.
Your customers use iPhones and Android phones. Both of them have AI assistants built-in so that some tasks can be passively executed without you being involved. Every year, Apple and Google announce newer features to help you get more from your smartphones by doing less. That’s affecting people’s expectations in more ways than you can imagine.
I believe machine learning is still in early stages but people have figured out interesting ways to solve tons of narrow problems using new deep learning and deep reinforcement learning technologies, now that both compute and data is available to solve problems acrosss industries. Technology is evolving slower than the adoption of the use cases powered by it. I use Google Home at home and I can only wish it was a bit smarter. It doesn’t stop me from using it everyday.
I’m expecting a similar kind of shift is about to hit the world of B2B SaaS. The users of your software are the same humans as the rest of us and they use the same smartphones, and in most cases, a very similar set of consumer apps. Maybe you have been optimizing for more engagement all this while for your SaaS software, but they must be wishing if they could skip a day or two and still got the job done. Let me give you an example.
Let’s consider an email marketing app that your customers use to send and measure the performance of their email campaigns. In a typical scenario, a marketer would come to the app every other day, create a few emails, schedule and then send. She knows her success rates with her campaigns and she has been doing it for a year now. She makes basic customizations based on the type of customers, geography, and timing. What if the app stopped requiring her to come and do all this every day? What if she could just tell the system her expectations and basic template and then ask it to make plans and customizations based on what it learned from you (and maybe from users like you)? What if the marketer used the app only to know analytics — which could be sent to her automatically and regularly through SMS, email or whatever medium she prefers— and didn’t log in for a month in a row but still got results? You will probably have zero engagement and probably more perceived value prop. Would they consider your SaaS product useful then? Of course, yes!
You will have to reimagine the success metrics for your SaaS software once you take this route. Instead of trying to increase how many times a customer is coming to your dashboard, you will try to reduce that. You will do the same for the time they spend in your dashboard per session. And so on. As you may have noticed by now, your product and growth teams would need a bit of rewiring of their brains to adjust to this paradigm shift in building and growing SaaS products. Depending on how you have defined your value metric, your business model may require a bit of tuning too.
The thing with disruption is that it impacts everyone unprepared. I see the overall SaaS community is figuring out vertical SaaS and similar ideas to see if large companies can still be built in this model as many of the well-known problems have either been solved or are being solved by existing SaaS giants. My guess is that there is still an enormous opportunity to solve specific problems across industries in a better way using a better design, technology or distribution model. You can pretty much disrupt and eat the lunch of any large SaaS company by taking a self-serve approach to product and growth because most of the big companies have removed their pricing pages and have gone upmarket with a mostly sales-driven model of customer acquisition. While you are at it, give a thought to the impending arrival of Invisible SaaS which can catch you completely off guard.
We at Artifacia are making a bold bet on the Invisible SaaS model as part of our Artifacia 2.0 vision so that we can drive even more value for our existing and future customers using our machine learning technology that we have been building for the last 3 years. As a pioneer of the model, we will have to figure out a lot of things to make it work for our business without compromising on user experience and business growth. As we learn more and build a framework of execution over the next few months or years, we would love to share it with the wider community. In the meanwhile, I’m open to helping other product startups figure out their machine learning strategy in whatever capacity I can.
P.S. I started my career as an ML Engineer/ Data Scientist before taking the leap as a startup founder in 2015. I learned SaaS only last year as we pivoted our startup from an API to a SaaS delivery model with the same underlying machine learning technology as the foundation. It’s interesting how one can connect the dots only looking backwards!

When I first started working on VWO, I came across many instances which have led me to wonder: Are enterprise applications(B2B) really that different from consumer apps(B2C)? How does the difference matter to the designer and the design process?
Here’s sharing some pointers that I have experienced over the past few years, for designers who are looking to join enterprise teams or are working on one.
Here’s how wikipedia defines it — An enterprise application is a computer software used to satisfy the needs of an organization rather than those of individual users.
In today’s corporate environment, most enterprise applications are complex, scalable, distributed, component-based, and mission-critical. Enterprise applications are all about the display, manipulation, storage of large amounts of data which is often complex, and the support/automation of business processes with that data.
With enterprise tools, you are building products that help organizations and their employees do their work better.
Note: Although there is a slight difference between B2B & Enterprise by definition; yet the difference is, more or less, irrelevant in today’s software ecosystem, and I would treat them as same for the purpose of this article.
Design for enterprise isn’t all that different. All principles of good design apply here as well. Yet, there are some differences when designing for a B2B product vs a B2C one.
Think of it as building a production car vs. building a commercial aircraft. While both are marvellous feats of engineering design which get the people from A to B, there are obvious differences in their use-cases, manufacturing time, testing & safety norms, user expectations, purchase & ownership; all of which impact the design and the process.
Similarly for B2B apps, the difference is in the unique challenges it brings and hence, the approach.
Disclaimer: A few of these challenges are faced in designing any kind of software, but they are definitely much more pronounced when designing for the enterprise.
The scale of complexity is generally higher than B2C apps, due to innumerable factors like multiple data states, visualization options, management operations, multiple-user collaboration and integrations with other software. Every design decision made to satisfy one requirement further affects many other requirements, sometimes in ways which are difficult to predict. A seemingly simple feature addition has to go through all kinds of checks and edge-case considerations.
💪 How to handle this:
What is the solution to complexity? — Simplicity, of course. Do not confuse this with the simplicity of interface or the minimal-UI fad that’s been going around. It’s about the simplicity that is brought about by proper planning & processes. No matter how tight the product cycles are, it is essential to invest time into design-thinking and bringing order to the set of requirements & specifications you’ve gathered, before starting to design. In fact, it is very much a part of design.
Jumping straight into Sketch, Figma or Photoshop is a natural tendency when you feel confident about a solution, but most of the times it’s too early. Take some time to sort out the overall context & implications of what you are about to design. Work your way through research & planning stages, figure out all possibilities & handle all edge-cases. And once you are ready, take stabs at the interface.
“If I had 60 minutes to cut down a tree, I would spend 40 minutes sharpening the axe and 20 minutes cutting it down.” — Abraham Lincoln.
Proper planning and building processes will always pay out in the longer run & lead to a coherent, bug-free product experience.
An enterprise user’s mindset and behavior pattern is quite different from a casual B2C user’s. An enterprise user, other than wanting to get his work done efficiently, often has other agendas like career growth, learning, and success within the organization. Designing for working professionals requires a good understanding of their job context, workflow, environment, aspirations, problems and also looking into their current solutions.
✌ How to ace this:
With an enterprise product, it’s very important to understand what the user needs, not just out of the product but also out of her job & career. Talking directly to end users, researching about their domain & trying out their current methodologies go a long way in developing empathy for the user.
Also, users are, often, so accustomed to their existing workflow and routine, that they find it hard to imagine what they really want. They might tell you about features and options but cannot show you the path to product innovation.
A guiding principle for enterprise teams is to know where customers are struggling today, and draw a path to what a product has to do in the future to solve those issues. There’s a lot that designers can do once they really understand what the user’s long-term goals are.
“People buy products to become a better version of themselves.” — JTBD
Instead of focusing on what users say they want, focus on what they actually do, and innovate from that point. Build lean prototypes based on your ideas and test them out with users.
Often, enterprise users might be too comfortable & complacent with their existing workflow to see the need to switch to another product. And even if they want to switch, it requires the consent and approval of a number of people. Not to mention, migration of existing data can be a pain for both the company and its employees. Unlike consumer apps, the cost of switching for enterprise apps is considerably higher.
😳 How to handle this:
The 2 biggest ways to convince an enterprise to switch to your product are-
The second one is where design can really shine. Productivity, workflow and processes matter a great deal to organizations. Take a good look at their current solutions, and find out where they are struggling. Think in terms of faster workflows, increasing efficiency, cutting costs. Innovating on these fronts often leads to solutions that convince enterprises to make the jump.
“The best, maybe the only, real, direct measure of innovation is change in human behaviour.” — Stewart Butterfield, Co-founder, Slack.
Always look for opportunities to refurbish the conventional approach to a more efficient & relevant one.
For an enterprise product, building new features, almost always, takes priority over enhancing existing user experience. It is very common to have dedicated design sprints when a product is starting out, but once the product has been launched, feature requests start pouring in. Paying-customers constantly keep asking for new capabilities and additions. Product teams chart out busy roadmaps ahead of them. At this point, it can be particularly challenging for designers to convince stakeholders to invest time and resources midway on improving UX and Design.
😳 How to tackle this:
Try and visualize the situation from a stakeholder’s perspective. They often feel — any sprint, week or month that is not spent building features or adding capabilities, is equivalent to some amount of potential revenue lost. Here, it is important to make people understand the power of improvements and how they often have more impact on revenue than adding more features. Highlight success stories. Talk directly to the top-management and get their buy-in. Designing for improvement will always need a careful analysis of pain points and experimentation with ideas, which requires time and innovation.
Also, while improvements on an existing product are crucial for a growing company, once in a while as an exercise, try brainstorming solutions from the ground up, as if your product or any competitors didn’t exist. More often than not, you will be pleasantly surprised by what comes up.
“The electric light did not come from the continuous improvement of candles.” — Oren Harari
Once you get the company’s conviction, start with small wins that can be achieved within a time-boxed sprint, and always try to measure the impact. Build the company’s trust in design gradually and move on to bigger improvements and experiments.
Ask for product and engineering team’s commitment towards ensuring good UX, and help them understand that its not just the design team’s job.
A recent survey conducted with over 3,000 enterprise designers revealed that the topmost challenge faced by enterprise design teams is improving UX consistency. Unlike consumer products, B2B products generally have longer product-cycles running asynchronously, many times with distributed teams.
Every designer faces similar challenges as other teams and is quite likely to introduce inconsistencies to the product like changes in components, design patterns, or even details like colors. These problems tend to multiply manifold as the team size increases or the product starts to scale up.
💪 How to tackle this:
Many companies have turned to building Design-Systems for consistency and scalability in the long term. A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. It usually consists of :
When enterprise teams were asked if they have a design system, around 55% said that they either have it or were in the process of building one. This is a positive sign. A point to note though is that a design system is never 100% done. It is built for the long run, meant to evolve with time.
“The design of each element should be thought out in order to be easy to make, and easy to repair.” — Leo Fender
Design systems are a huge step towards ensuring consistent UX.
Here’s some enterprise design systems to draw inspiration from: Lightning design system by Salesforce, and Harmony Design System by Intuit.
Quite a few designers, after working on enterprise softwares, find it boringly monotonous. People coming from agency or B2C backgrounds often find enterprise work lacking excitement or variety. Opportunities to design stunning visual micro-interactions & animations (that we drool over on dribbble) do not come often. In such cases, work can become a drag and leave the designer feeling unmotivated & unfulfilled.
😳 How to prevent this:
Enterprise UX is all about helping users get their job done, and helping them become better at their work. Building a mesmerizing UI that captivates the user, (while it doesn’t hurt) will always be lower on the priority list. A standardized, predictable user-interface, one that is immediately intuitive works best for the target users.
The goal is to get the users to utter “wow!” — not for your gorgeous UI, but for how efficiently the product helped them get a job done.
Selecting designers with aligned intentions and motivation is of key importance while building an enterprise design team. The motivation should largely be drawn from solving complex challenges, and seeing how your design helps users get their work done.
Therefore, it is essential to evaluate outlooks and set correct expectations for every designer joining the team .
Enterprise is evolving. Enterprise softwares are no longer clunky and boring. Users nowadays expect the same level of performance & experience that they get with consumer apps. They appreciate beautiful UI & do not want to read through documentation before getting started. Next-gen technologies like VR, AI and voice are already in our lives, and will soon make it to the workplace. These are exciting times for enterprise software and the scope for what a designer can do, is endless.

This is Part 2 of my epic four-part series, taking a deep-dive into SaaS metrics. I’ll be covering KPIs for Growth, Marketing, Sales and Customer Success, and offering formulae, explanations and expert opinions for 50 essential metrics.
Click to read the complete post, or download it as a PDF to save for later.
Rapid, large-scale customer acquisition is a pre-requisite for growth, and these marketing-specific SaaS metrics are designed to help you understand and improve your ability to generate new visitors, leads and customers.
As well as providing insight into customer acquisition, these SaaS metrics will help determine the quality of your leads. After all, marketing and sales shouldn’t exist in separate silos, and website visitors and leads don’t mean a thing unless they turn into paying customers.
With both functions having a crucial (and overlapping) role to play in achieving growth, it’s important to choose metrics that cover both camps.
Let’s say you have a goal of 100 new customers this year. In order to reach those 100 customers, you might need 200 engaged, ready-to-buy leads: after all, not everybody you start a conversation with ends up a paying customer.
Working backwards, to generate those 200 sales-qualified leads, you might need to collect the contact details of 400 people, some of whom will have a serious interest in your products, while others will require a bit more time to reach the same place. To generate those 400 leads, you might need 2,000 website visitors.
Understanding how this progression through the sales funnel happens allows you to predict the number of visitors and leads you’ll need to actually hit your sales targets, and gives direction to your marketing strategy.
Unique website visitors refers to the number of distinct people that visit your website over a particular period of time (commonly a month).
Visitors come in all shapes and sizes, from sales-ready buyers to sceptical researchers (and even a few people who’ve ended up on your site by mistake). In order to determine which visitors are which, and identify potential customers, it’s essential to learn more about them.
Email subscribers are visitors who’ve signed up for your newsletter, mailing list or blog updates. Though they’ve parted with their contact details, they haven’t shown any indication of sales intent, or interest in your SaaS product, making them distinct from leads.
Leads are visitors that have filled out a contact form on your website, usually in exchange for a download or free resource. In doing so, these visitors have parted with more than just their email address — often submitting their name, job title, business name or website address.
These are leads that fit the appropriate demographics of a customer, and demonstrate interest in your solution, either by viewing several product-focused pages on your website (like case studies or pricing pages), or engaging with more product-focused content offers.
These are leads that meet the MQL qualification criteria, and have demonstrated sales-readiness — usually by requesting a sales conversation or free demo.
Opportunities are SQLs that have been handed over to your sales team, vetted, and deemed a genuine sales opportunity, kicking-off the sales process.
These are people that have signed on the dotted line and committed to paying for your service for a particular length of time. Though more of a sales metric, it’s important to track how marketing-generated leads convert into paying customers, in order to assess the overall performance of your marketing strategy.
Many SaaS products use free trials and demos to engage prospective customers, and it’s important to understand where these fit into the sales funnel.
Free Trial users are usually counted as MQLs: signing-up for anything “free” requires relatively little commitment from users, and simply kicking the tyres of your product provides no indication of sales intent.
Some SaaS products can be more complex, and require custom set-up before use. This often means that free trials aren’t viable, and instead, running product demos is a more effective way of proving out the value of your product.
Getting on the phone and sitting through a demo requires a greater commitment from your visitors, so demo requests are usually regarded as SQLs. Though the distinction isn’t always clear, it’s important to choose a simple, consistent rule for qualification, and stick to it.
There are two ways to generate more customers: increasing the number of people entering the sales funnel, and improving the rate at which visitors turn into leads, and leads turn into customers.
Though lead and customer acquisition should always be a priority, it’s often possible to generate more leads and customers, at a lower cost, by improving your conversion rates. The first step in improving conversion rates is to track them at crucial points of your sales funnel.
The rate at which website visitors convert into leads. Tools like pop-ups, email subscriptions, free downloads and landing pages can all be used to convert anonymous visitors into identifiable leads, and it’s important to optimise this conversion rate over time.
This is an overarching conversion rate that looks at the rate at which leads convert into customers. Generating lots of poor-fit leads will lead to an extremely low conversion rate, and vice versa, so this can offer a very revealing insight into the quality of the leads you’re generating.
This shows the rate at which marketing-qualified leads turn into sales-qualified leads, and it can provide useful insights into lead quality and the performance of your sales development reps.
This is the rate at which free trial users become paying customers. Small improvements to this figure will generate big improvements in revenue, so it’s important to continually optimise your free trial onboarding process.
The ratio of your marketing spend to Average Contract Value (which I’ll go into below) is useful for tracking how expenditure on marketing channels translates into sales revenue.
Month-on-Month MQL Growth Rate refers to the rate at which Marketing Qualified Leads are growing over time.
For example, if we generated 100 marketing qualified leads last month, and 110 this month, we’d have month-on-month MQL growth of 10%.
As well as tracking the MQL growth rate, we can also track the rate of growth of sales-qualified leads (SQLs):
For example, if we generated 50 sales qualified leads last month, and 60 this month, we’d have month-on-month SQL growth of 20%.

What are the average subscription contract sizes for SaaS companies at IPO? I recently wrote a post analyzing how much ~20 public SaaS companies charge their customers and calculated their subscription ASPs (average selling price) or ACVs (annual contract value). To get those numbers, I looked at the last reported quarterly subscription revenue, multiplied by 4 to get an implied ARR figure (annual recurring revenue), then divided by the number of customers to get the average subscription contract size. Also note I isolated subscription revenue to leave out pro-serv, implementation and training revenue.
I took that same framework and applied it to 42 software/cloud companies to find their average ACV’s at IPO quarter— implied ARR over total customers. There is certainly wide disparity among the customer base within each of the companies, and while the average doesn’t tell the whole story, it’s directionally correct. For example, CRM and Twilio, with $13K and $8K averages respectively, had customers paying them in the millions per year at IPO, but had a long tail of smaller customers. Ideally, it would be nice to know subscription revenue distribution, but that data isn’t public. See the chart below for overall averages:
The median is $44K across this group, lower than I would have thought. 12 out of the 42 or roughly 30% charge less than $10K/year on average in subscription revenue. Do larger subscription ACVs tend to come from bigger companies? Not from this group at least — there’s no correlation between ARR scale and size of contracts. TEAM, the largest with regard to ARR at IPO at $385M, had $7.5K average contracts. RALY, the smallest of the group at $50M of ARR, had $50K contracts. There’s also only very weak correlation between ARR growth and contract sizes.
I would have expected the median to be larger for public companies. It’s clear from this data multi-billion dollar public SaaS companies can be built with relatively small ACVs, and I think other things like a big market opportunity, great product, team, and execution are more important factors in creating a large and enduring public SaaS company.

There’s a good rule that you should do things that don’t scale first. In this context, the best marketing strategy for an early stage startup is network effect on a smaller scale.
The network effect is the most organic way of securing your first clients. The basic idea is that you do a great job for your clients, which in turn provides them with an incentive to recommend you to new potential clients from their market. Ideally, each new customer gives you a number of leads that are already partially qualified — they know that you’re good business.
As you can imagine, this depends on how good of a product/service you have, how good you are at customer service, etc. Supposing you don’t lack in those areas, there are strategies that might help you reap the benefits of the network effect. I’ll break down what we learned from implementing these strategies at RightHello.
Had we approached a bigger market from the start, achieving the network effect would’ve taken much more work and resources that an early stage B2B startup can’t afford.
In terms of footprint big enough to create a small network effect, 10 customers from Germany + 10 from Poland have a totally different effect than 20 from Poland.
After some time, when people ask for a lead generation company on a polish IT discussion board, one of our supporters or clients is sure to point to us.
As a great read on the subject, I recommend ‘Crossing the chasm’ by Geoffrey Moore. I think it’s a must-read for all technology entrepreneurs and a great inspiration for choosing a go-to-market strategy.
In the end, I have one last important piece of advice:
Don’t Screw It Up!
You have to provide great value, great customer support, really work your ass off for customer success. You’re picking a small niche, so a few unhappy customers could kill your reputation and, in turn, sales.
A mistake can happen to anyone, so if you mess things up — do everything you can to fix them. Offer discounts, give money back, improve your product, do whatever it takes to make clients smile again. Negative opinion will cost you money, happiness, health and your last shirt.
But if the customer sees that you are more sad than him and that you are doing everything to make the sun shine again, you can win him back.

グローバルのSaaS市場は2018年までに約6兆円、年率19％で成長し続け、オンプレのシェアを奪っていくと予測されている。日本は欧米よりオンプレが強い市場性とはいえ、SaaS系のスタートアップの方と会う機会が増えている中で、日本でもこの流れは不可逆な潮流にあると感じる。
（ミクロな話だが、）一投資家として、ありがたいことに様々なSaaS系のスタートアップの方と日々議論させて頂く機会が多くある。その中で、SaaS市場が拡大する一方、どのようにSaaSが進化を遂げていくのか、日々思いを巡らせることが多い。そこで今回は、SaaS市場でいま起こっている主要な5つのトレンドについて、Bessemer VenturesやPointNine等の記事をベースに紐解といてみたい。
まず、Horizontal SaaSとはマーケティング、営業、HR、開発のような企業内の特定部門や機能に特化したソフトウェアサービスを意味する。SalesforceやWorkday、Github等がこれに当たる。Horizontal SaaSは、SaaSの歴史を紐解くとSAPやMicrosoftが提供していたオンプレからの転換から始まっており、部門特化でオンプレが広がっていたことを考えると、SaaSの成長の中で自然な流れだったと言える。
いまのHorizontal SaaSのトレンドについて一言で言うと、Salesforceに代表されるような”カテゴリーの勝者”が決まり、成熟期の様相を呈している（詳細は以下）。
主なトレンド/特徴
・教育されたユーザー基盤：成長期に多数のプレイヤーがユーザー企業を教育してきたおかげで、ユーザーはHorizontal SaaSを十分使いこなせる
・過酷な競争環境：群雄割拠する中でプロダクトは既に成熟してきており、プレイヤーも多く、プロダクトでの差別化が難しくなっている
・”カテゴリーの勝者”の出現：Salesforce, Zendesk, HubSpot, Github,Slackのように特定領域での勝敗が見えてきた。CRMで言うと、SalesforceはCRM SaaSの中でSAPやIBM等の巨大企業を抑え、シェア16％でNo 1の地位を確立している
・”カテゴリーの勝者のプラットフォーム化”：カテゴリーの勝者が決まっている中で、勝者のサービス上に乗っかるプラグイン型のmicro SaaS等のアプローチが増えつつある
まとめると、カテゴリーの勝者自体がプラットフォーム化してきており、次に話をするSaaSのアンバンドル・リバンドルのような新たなアプローチや、バリューチェーンの先にあるプレイヤーとプラットフォーム上でつながる例が多く出てきている。（但し、日本では勝者と言えるSaaSは、SalesforceとGithub位の印象なので、まだまだ余地はあると感じる。）
Horizontal SaaSがプラットフォーム化する中で、起こってきたトレンドがSaaSの”アンバンドリング”と”リバドンリング”の潮流だ。
SaaSのアンバンドリングのトレンド
まず起こったのが”アンバンドリングの潮流だ。具体的には、以下にあるMicro SaaSとUnbundling APIの出現がある。
・MicroSaaSの出現：Horizontal SaaSの競合が激しくなり、カテゴリーでの態勢が決まってくる中で、SaaSとしてフルの機能を持たず、「寄らば大樹の陰」的にニッチ領域に向けたプラグインを提供したり、既存のSaaSを使いやすくするSaaSを提供するプレイヤーが無数に出現した。Shopify上で、より良いビジュアルツールを提供するStoremapper社が好例だ。
・Unbundling APIの出現：APIをパッケージ化してSaaSとして提供し、ユーザー自体が好みのUXに改善できるようなSaaSが出てきた。マーケティングでのCleabits社やカスタマーサポートでのsupportive.io社が良い例だ。（競争が激しくなる中で自然な流れだが、ユーザー側に開発力が求められるため、ユーザー数が限定される等、スケールのしにくさが課題だ。）
SaaSのリバドリングのトレンド
この様なSaaSのアンバンドリングが起こった結果、ユーザー視点では複数のSaaSを運用する煩雑さが出てきてしまった。結果、次に起こった潮流がSaaSのリバンドリングの潮流だ。具体的には、SaaS Hubやデータ統合プラットフォームの出現、メッセージングAppからの染み出しがある。
・SaaS Hubの出現：まずはカテゴリーのSaaS同士を一括管理する”SaaSのためのSaaS”というニーズが高くなってきた。例で言うと、マーケティング領域でのLytics社等がある。
・データ統合プラットフォームの出現：また、マーケティング、カスタマーサポート、CRMといった別々のSaaS領域のデータを中央集権的に統合・分析したい、というユーザーニーズが出てきた。その代表企業は、segment.io社がある。彼らは「顧客に関する全てのデータを収集・統合・分析できる単一プラットフォーム（ハブ）機能」を提供している。
・メッセージングAppからの染み出し：同様に、ちょっと情報を知りたいけど、複数のSaaSにいちいちログインするのが面倒というユーザー課題も出てきた。それと並行して、SlackやAttlassianが提供するHipchat等のビジネスチャットも普及が進んだ。結果、これらのサービスからの染み出しとして、SaaSの情報をユーザーに簡単に”お知らせ”するインターフェース機能を拡張する動きが出てきた。
Horizontal SaaSが上記の進化を遂げるのと並行して、特定の業界の課題に根ざしたVertical SaaSも増えているのも大きなトレンドだ。個人的な見解として、①マーケットが数兆円規模で大きく、②IT化が立ち遅れている、かつ③人手不足の課題感のある、ヘルスケア、物流、農業、建設、リーガル、ホテルなどの業界で特に色々なSaaSビジネスが広がっている。物流ではFlexport社や建設ではPlanGrid社が好例だ。
しかしながら、Vertical SaaS領域は、プレイヤーが多く出てきている一方、Horizontal SaaSとは２巡ほど遅れており、カテゴリーの勝者がまだ出てきていないのが特徴だ。具体的には以下に記す。
主なトレンド/特徴
・ユーザーの教育コストの高止まり：そもそもIT化が遅れている業界のため、ユーザーのITリテラシーも高くない傾向が強い。そのため、SaaSビジネスが立ち上がるためには、ユーザーへの教育コストが非常に高いまま
・カテゴリーの勝者不在=市場機会の広がり：上記の理由のため、Vertical SaaSは小さなプレイヤーが集まる分散市場で、Horizontalのような勝者と言える存在は出てきていない。チャンスはまだ広がっているが、よりやり切る力とそのスピードが勝負の分かれ目になる。(全てに言えるが）
業界特化型のVertical SaaSや、メッセージングAppに代表されるHorizontal SaaS(例. Slack)が広がりをみせる中で、出てきた潮流がモバイル-ファーストSaaSの流れだ。特にVertical SaaSの場合、業界の課題に根差したUXを求められ、モバイル活用による現場の生産性向上が競合優位性になるケースがある。例えば、建設業向けのPROCORE社はPMや作業員は屋外におり、PC環境だと作業効率が悪いため、モバイル-ファーストのアプローチをとっている。他スタートアップの例としては以下のとおりである。
これに続いて、FitbitのようなB2C、農業や製造業のようなB2B領域でIoTの活用の動きが広がっている。その中で、IoT-ファーストSaaSも広がっていくことが予想される。（日本でも、IoTとソフトウェアを使って養殖の効率化を行うUMITRON社のようなスタートアップも出てきており、今後広がりをみせてくると想定される）
SaaSビジネスの基本として、初期のSaaS単体である程度までは順調に拡大するが、オンプレ/競合SaaSとの闘いで、顧客獲得コストは次第に上がり、高い利益率を維持することが難しくなる。従って、自然な流れとして、SaaS+αにより、積極的な顧客課題の解決策 -Solution- 提供をし、売上拡大のupsellや利益率向上の動きが活発になっている。例えば、ソフトウェアからソリューションへの軸足転換を謳っているIBM社もその好例の１つとして考えられる。
主な+αとしては、２つの大きな潮流が活発になっていると考える。
SaaS+マーケットプレイス (SaaS-Enabled Marketplace）
SaaS-Enabled-Marketplaceについては、以前記事で書かせて頂いたが、SaaSがバリューチェーンの前後にいるユーザーの顧客やサプライヤーとつなぐことで、顧客課題に踏み込んだソリューションを提供するサービスである。これにより、ユーザーをロックインするだけではなく、事業でアクセスできる市場(Total Accessible Market)自体を広げ、事業拡大させることができる。（SaaS単体の場合、国内では市場規模が100億円以下というケースもざらなので、TAMを広げる必要性が出てくる）１つの例はZenefits社だ。 ZenefitsはユーザーであるHRに、給与計算/勤怠管理/従業員情報管理のSaaSを無料で提供して、他方、保険会社の保険商品を、Zenefits上で企業/従業員が購入できるマーケットプレイスを展開している。（SEMについての詳細はこちら）
SaaS+AI/自動化
もう一つの潮流としては、人工知能(AI)やBot活用による自動化によるソリューション提供の広がりだ。ご存知の通り、CPUやストレージの進化と共に、機械学習の技術革新が起こる中で、誰でも簡単にAIやBotに手を伸ばせるインフラが整ってきた。（直近では、Amazon社のAxela/Echoの音声認識が市場の注目を集めている。）
その中で、SaaS単体のサービス提供から一歩踏み込んで、機械学習を使った面倒な情報入力補助（音声入力）やSaaSにたまった情報からの将来予測等のソリューション提供によりupsellし、事業拡大を狙うスタートアップも多く出てきている。今年IPOを予定しているCRM SaaS+ 営業行動予測/レコメンドを行うInsidesales.com社もこの１つの例だと思う。
以上のように、欧米を中心にSaaSを取り巻く進化は日々絶え間なく起こっている。一方、日本はオンプレのシェアが高く、まだまだHorizontal SaaSも含めて周回遅れで、まだまだやれることが多い。しかし、このようなSaaS全体の進化トレンドを踏まえつつ、SaaSのサービス設計をどう進化させていくか、は国内のスタートアップにおいても重要な論点になる。

Be the first to respond.
Six months ago I started working on a my first *real* Saas app called Checkly. This post is a snapshot of five learnings that stuck with me over the last half year. I hope it helps other self-starting solo developers that have embraced the gooey warmth and bliss that is Vue.js.
To give you some context, this is what Checkly does in a nutshell. Checkly is a tool for IT Ops and Developer people. It does two things.
Enough sales talk. These are the five things that I learned.
Users will probably interact more with your login page than with your landing page, pricing page or some other irrelevant part of your app that only YOU think is really really cool. That’s why login and its related authentication buddies should not suck.
In a typical and non-trivial authentication scenario you have multiple hoops you have to jump through:
That is already a fair amount of complexity and a lot of things that need to go right before your user can actually start doing stuff. Also, testing of these components can be tricky, as there is a lot of backend and third-party service interaction going on that is hard to mock out or otherwise work around.
In my solution, I took two specific architectural decisions to ease this pain:
Here’s a visual representation of the whole setup. The dancing hamster means you fully signed up and/or logged in.
When a user’s JWT token expires, the API backend will say so by responding with a 401 Unauthorised header. You probably want to redirect the user to your login page or show some friendly message. Using the Axios http client and Vue this is about five lines of code.
What is a component? A button can be a component. But also a full screen can be a component. Your whole app is a component! Turns out, the split between “components” and “not-components” is not really fine grained enough when making sense of how an app is built.
Of course, I’m not the only one who stumbled onto that. Dan Abramov ‘s article, in a ReactJS context of course, kinda sums it up: split components into containers and things you look at (representational components in Dan’s post, views in mine). The only thing really specific to my solution is that views are always mapped to sub routes.
In the example below you see a typical edit screen. In this case an edit screen for editing an API check. This is the container and it maps to url /checks/<id>/edit/apiThe screen is on the “locations & scheduling” tab, which is mapped to its own sub route at /scheduling
This tab contains the country selection and time scheduling components (the red ones). However, these components also live in three other screens: two times in a create wizard and one time in the edit screen for browser checks.
Each of these screens is different and provides a different data context and visual context for each of the components, like whether we are in “edit” mode or “create” mode. In other words, not only the data injected into the component changes (via props), but also the visual arrangement on the screen. Using the containers / views split helps organise this.
And now for something completely different!
The Checkly backend is deployed on Heroku, so I looked into serving the web app also from Heroku. The fewer moving parts the better! However, this is more hassle than you would think.
I looked at third party deployment/CI/CD services. I looked at Netlify. But in the end, I just used some simple NPM scripting together with the knowledge I already had from AWS.
Whip up an S3 bucket and just install the s3-deploy NPM package. Add three lines in the package.json scripts section.
This set of scripts pushes a Vue.js app that was initially started with Vue-CLI to an AWS S3 bucket. In my situation, I also fronted the S3 bucket with AWS Cloudfront as a CDN. There are a couple of initial setup gotcha’s when creating this setup:
Time out. I’ve been in IT for about 20 years now. I have nerdy war stories about the first internet bubble. But as much as technology, the market and the world has changed, one thing has never changed
DEVELOPING NICE AND USEFUL APPLICATIONS IS A SH*T TON OF WORK
And everyone STILL underestimates this: managers, engineers, customers, me. Therefore, the sole reason for me to use third party solutions, open source frameworks, plugins etc. is whether I can reduce the amount of work. Not to integrate with something fancy, not to be the latest to use x or y. Not because Facebook uses it. Seems totally obvious, but many people seem to forget.
Rant over. Here are three Vue.js plugins I can recommend. I use them heavily. What they do is probably clear. They are not perfect, but they will help you reduce your workload.
The Vue.js dev tools Chrome extension is incredible. I use it every day. For me, it is an integral part of the Vue.js eco system, like Vuex and Vue Router. Here’s an example of why it rocks.
I’m fairly sensitive to UI and UX concerns. I don’t mind spending a lot of time getting
This means that in error situations, or other corner cases, I still want something nice to happen. Making this work during development for the frontend can be quite tricky.
Toggling true/false states with quick edit really, really REALLY helps when transitions and stuff depend on complex backend states and XHR messages.
In the example above, the backend API needs to be in a specific state to trigger a certain screen on the frontend. However, that state is not static: it depends on time and other variables that continuously change.
Short of adding your own debug buttons to toggle these states, there is not much else you can do. Vue.js dev tools takes this pain away. Thanks Vue.js dev tools.

これは私の前職のBCGで働いていた頃に、とある上司から言われた言葉だ。言葉の通り、プライシングはvalue-based pricingにしろ、cost-plus pricingにしろ、サイエンスな部分がよく強調される。しかし、プライシングは極めて戦略性の高い、アートな部分があることを忘れてはならない。価格はその企業のポジショニングを語る強力なマーケティングメッセージであり、それに消費者心理がどう動くかは、数字では予想し切れない。
いかにプライシングのアートの部分が重要か、米百貨店大手 J.C.ペニーの失敗例を紹介する。J.C.ペニーは競争の激しい小売において、自社の業界でのポジショニングの見直しを2011年から始めた。その一環として、従来の小売で用いられるような、年中やっているセールやクーポンを一切排して、"".00""に統一するなど、透明性の高い価格体系に刷新した。このプライシング戦略は大失敗に終わり、2013年以降は1.8兆円規模あった売上が一気に1.3兆円(▼28％)に下がってしまった。(ECの影響もあるが)この呪いは未だに解けず、今年は140店舗の閉店、6,000人の解雇を余儀なくされ、未だに低迷し続けている。
J.C.ペニーの例は色々な示唆はあるが、1つの重要な学びとして、同じ価格だとしても、プライシング方法に対する消費者の感度が変わることを示している。(例えば、Tシャツ$100、 50％オフセールと書くのと、Tシャツ$50では同じ価格だが、前者の方が消費者の購買を促す。）今回はSaaSでも用いられている、アート的な重要な方法論である、心理学的なテクニックをいくつかご紹介したい。
プライシングで、一番有名なテクニックが、「アンカリング効果」だ。価格は常に相対的な概念であり、誰しもが何かを買う時、比較を行う。アンカリング効果とは、この価格比較をする際に、はじめ提示された条件を基準(アンカー)として判断をしてしまう人間の特性を利用したテクニックだ。(よく交渉の場でも利用される)。
上のConvert社の例を見てみよう。一番安いプランは$449/月だが、最も高い$6,777/月のプランが一番最初に目に入れ、安価リングすることで、$449/月が安いよう感じさせている。
・価格設定を階段型(Tiered)にした上で、最も売りたいプランを一番右に、最も売りにくい高いプランを一番左(アンカー)に設定する
・upsell/cross-sellする際に、最も高い更新プランを一番最初に紹介して、最もリーズナブルなプランを最後に丁寧に説明する
SalesforceやHubSpotなど多くのSaaS企業で使わているテクニックが、センターステージ効果だ。センターステージ効果とは、3つの選択肢を与えられると、人間は一番真ん中の選択肢が最も平均的な選択肢と捉える心理的な性質を利用したテクニックだ。
（4プランだが、）Salesforce.comの例を見てみよう。一番センターに150€のプランが”Most popular”と目立つように設計されている。
・プランを作る際に、最も売りたいプランを真ん中に持ってきて、「一番売れてます」とハイライトする
マクドナルドのバリューセットのように、複数のプロダクトを合せて1つの価格で提供する手法をバンドリングと言う。このバンドリングでのセットメニューを効果的に売るための心理学テクニックとして、おとりプラン(Decoy pricing)の設定という方法がある。メディア大手Economist社の定期購読プランの有名な例で見てみよう。
Economistの定期購読では、(かつて)以下の3つのプランを提供していた。
A.電子版のみ：$59/月
B.プリント版のみ：$125/月
C.電子版+プリント版：$125/月
この内、Bプリント版のみの価格設定は売るための価格設定ではなく、電子版+プリント版のセットをアピールするために設定されたおとりプランだ。このプライシングについて、実際にMITが学生を対象に実験を行った。まずAとCのプランだけを提供した場合、購入分布はA 68%、C 32％とA電子版のみが最も売れた。一方で、Bのプランを追加した場合、A 16%、B 0%、C 84%と、C電子版+プリント版が最も売れる結果となった。
・階段型プライシングにおいて、最も売りたいプラン(Professional等)がお得になるように、最も安いBasicプランの価格を高めに調整する（以下、Shutterstock社の例)
「1個199円」など末尾を9にするプライシングは、スーパー等小売でよく使われる手法だ。これは、人間の脳は素早く数字を処理するために、一番左の数字の印象で無意識の内に判断する、”Left Digit Effect(左のケタ効果)”が存在する。これを活用したケースが、Zendeskのプライシングだ。
Essential以外のプランについては、末尾を9にすることでよりお得感を演出している。MITの小売店のTシャツのプライシングで行った実験では、同じTシャツを$44、$39、$34で提供した結果、信じがたいことに$39が他の2つより売れた結果になったことからもこの効果は検証されている。
・プライシングのA/Bテストをする際に、月額6,000円、月額5,900円、月額6,900円でCVRがどの程度が変わるかテストした上で、価格設定を行う
ナンバー9効果の発展形として使われるようになった手法が、偶数・奇数効果だ。小売業界では、ナンバー9の手法はあまりにも一般的になっているため、ユーザーも399円と400円の違いが無いように頭で処理できるようになった。ナンバー9が効かなくなってきた場合に、末尾を9以外の数字にすることで、CVRをより上げる手法だ。バーチャルアシスタントSaaSのZirtual社などで活用されている。
・競合のプライシング戦略でナンバー9効果を狙った手法が取られていた場合、9以外の数字でのプライシングをA/BテストをしてCVRを見てみる
SaaSの階段式プライシングを設計する際に、「いくつプランを用意すればよいか」を考える上で、”選択のパラドクス”は知っておくべき重要な人間の脳の特性である。”選択のパラドクス”とは、人間の脳のワーキングメモリーは、7±2が最大に覚えられる対象数であり、これを超えると判断ができなくなるという現象である。
米コロンビア大学の有名なジャムの実験では、消費者に24種類のジャムを販売した場合、購入のCVRは3%であったのに対し、6種類の場合、CVRが30%であったことでも検証されている。
・SaaSのプラン設計においては標準的に導入されている。SaaSにおいては平均プラン数は約3.5であり、プラン数はその前後に収めるのが良い。
ハイ&ロー効果は、特売のように一定期間(または条件）で価格を上下させることで、消費者に希少性を訴求することで購買意識を喚起し、コンバージョンにつなげる手法だ。スーパー等の小売で一般的に使われているが、SaaSでも以下のようなケースで使われている。
・30日間ディスカウント(または無料)トライアル
・期間限定のディスカウント
・イベントの参加者向けディスカウント 等
・ハイ&ロー効果を活用するには、「今回が特別で今後めったに無い」という希少性を潜在ユーザーに信じさせるような仕掛けが必要になる
・あまりやりすぎると、潜在ユーザーのCVRが下がるだけでなく、低価格でのサインナップが増え、収益性を悪化させるので注意が必要である
これら心理学テクニックはプライシングによって収益を最大化する上では、非常に有効な手段だ。しかし、狙う顧客セグメント、プロダクトの競合優位性、セールスチャネルと販売サイクルなど、上位にある戦略がより重要であることは言うまでもない。

Valuation in the private markets is certainly much more of an art than a science, and particularly for companies that are growing extremely fast. But what would a SaaS company be worth based on the same multiples that public companies trade on today? EV (enterprise value) / revenue is a primary valuation metric for many high-growth software businesses, but in the private markets, many companies focus on ARR (annual recurring revenue) given it’s a leading indicator of revenue. Public companies don’t usually report ARR, but many sell-side analysts are starting to look at EV / ARR multiples as a valuation metric and derive it as quarterly subscription revenue x 4. I found these ARR figures for almost 20 high-growth public SaaS companies and looked at their current and projected revenue and ARR based on sell-side analyst estimates. It produced a reasonable comparable set of revenue, ARR, and growth metrics (both historical and projections) that can be used against private companies. It not only includes revenue and ARR multiples but also growth-adjusted multiples based on estimated revenue and ARR, which shows what investors are willing to pay for a unit of growth.
Take a look at the below chart — you can see from this group the median multiple for EV / 2017 Ending ARR (a proxy for current ARR) is ~10x and EV / 2018 revenue (a proxy for next-twelve months since we’re in February) is 8x.
2017 Ending ARR and CY 2018E Revenue Multiples
So what is an illustrative valuation for a fictional SaaS company based on these multiples? Note this output implies a pre-money since it’s a proxy for enterprise value. You can click on this link, download the spreadsheet and enter your company’s metrics to see what valuation it informs, but below is a fictional company that has the following revenue and ARR figures;
Here are the valuation ranges for this hypothetical SaaS company based on high-growth public SaaS multiples:
There is a massive delta based on the various multiples — a high of $360M and low of $102M. Why is that? The higher numbers come from the growth-adjusted multiples and because this fictional SaaS company is growing much faster than the public comps, the implied valuation is skewed higher. Moreover, public companies have longer operating histories and a tendency to outperform the growth numbers they guide to the street, whereas it’s at times harder to predict precise growth targets for ultra-fast-growing private companies. To find out an implied valuation for a company, click on the link here, download the spreadsheet and enter the appropriate metrics [enter metrics in yellow shaded cells]. To the right in the link, you can see all the public company stats and multiples. There’s also a wide disparity in the public comps — Atlassian and Shopify trade at roughly 15x ARR and Twilio and Box are at ~5–6x ARR.
Multiples are only one factor in determining the appropriate valuation of a private SaaS company; there are many others like the perceived team, market size, profitability, efficiency, competition, product, etc. But based solely on revenue and ARR estimates this is a fair proxy of valuation using high-growth public SaaS medians as a reference point (and priced as of 1-Feb-2018!).

SaaS multiples are higher than they’ve been since we’ve tracked the data (Q4 2014): of the 80 SaaS companies we follow, the average public SaaS business is trading at 11.98x revenue while the median is 9.49x. Interestingly, the gap between the average and median continues to be large (2.5x), meaning more attractive SaaS companies are being rewarded with big premiums. Also of note, 46% of companies are trading at 10x revenue or greater, which is the highest the figure has ever been. It’s a great time to be a SaaS company. The data is below.
Negative EBITDA, positive cash flow. The median SaaS business had trailing twelve month revenue of $384mm, EBITDA of -$22mm, but positive operating cash flow of $35mm thanks to up-front collections on annual contracts. Indeed so long as you’re growing (the median annual growth rate is 27%), investors will overlook negative EBITDA especially if the business is cash flow positive after working capital changes.
The trend is still on. The chart in the picture shows median revenue multiples we’ve collected since Q4 2014. During that period, the median SaaS multiple has ranged from 4.6x to 9.49x with an average of 6.99x.
SaaS margins are still terrible. Investors and founders love saying “SaaS margins are great.” They’re not. They’re horrible. The median EBITDA margin for the companies above was -6% and the average was -5%. Fixed costs for SaaS are terribly high and worse yet those fixed costs are mostly people, meaning the only way to materially cut costs is layoffs. If you’ve ever fired someone, you know cutting costs by cutting people is not easy and hurts the culture and morale of remaining members.
Premium gets a premium. Premium SaaS businesses trade at premium multiples. In the data set, 37 companies trade at greater than 10x revenue, 23 trade at greater than 15x, and 14 trade at greater than 20x.
Growth is strong. The median of 27% is strong given the size of these companies ($384mm of median revenue).
SaaS businesses are healthy. There is almost no debt on these businesses as banks don’t like ‘asset-lite’ businesses like software. Additionally, these companies have $298mm of cash on the balance sheet on median, plenty relative to annual burn (recall EBITDA is -$22mm). The number of years of cash on the balance sheet is less important given that these businesses are generally cash flow positive (median of $35mm; only 24 out of the 80 companies have negative cash flow. Note that 48 out of the 80 have negative EBITDA, but again that’s acceptable so long as the growth is present and cash flow overall is positive.
Recent IPO’s are killing it. Some of the latest IPO’s are trading at unreal multiples: Sprout is at 22x, Cloudflare is at 18x, Datadog is 36x, Crowdstrike is 27x, Slack is 21x, and Zoom Video is a whopping 37x. It shows that now is a great time to come to market whether you’re raising money or selling the business. Some recent IPO’s are trading at more reasonable multiples (HealthCatalyst is at 8x and Ping is at 9x), so the disparity in valuation for premium SaaS versus just good SaaS is very wide.
So what’s this data mean for a fast growing private SaaS business? Public multiples and trends guide what’s happening in the private markets: i) as compensation for illiquidity, size, and lack of profitability, prudent investors will look to invest in your private SaaS business somewhere below the median unless your growth rate is demonstrably higher than 38% YOY; ii) financing will continue to come from equity, less so from debt, although we’ve seen lenders like Lighter Capital get more creative; iii) and burning cash is still acceptable on an EBITDA basis, so long as free cash flow is positive or moving in the right direction.

Geliştirdiğimiz Linkwind projesinin duyurusunu buradaki yazı ile yapmıştım. Bilmeyenler için fazla vaktinizi almadan projenin ne olduğunu birkaç cümle ile açıklamak istiyorum.
Linkwind projesi tek satır kod dahi yazmadan kendi HackewNews benzeri link paylaşım ve tartışma platformunuzu kurmanızı sağlayan bir SAAS(Software as a service) platformu. Linkwind websitesine girip hesabınızı oluşturuyorsunuz ve platformunuz saniyeler içerisinde kullanıma hazır hale geliyor. Detaylı bilgi için Linkwind websitesini ziyaret edebilir veya buradaki yazıyı okuyabilirsiniz.
Bu yazıda da projeyi geliştirirken hangi teknolojileri kullandığımızı, front-end ve back-end tarafını hangi diller ile kodlağımızı ve uygulamayı hangi platformda nasıl host ettiğimizden bahsedeceğim. Geliştirilen bir projede hangi teknolojilerin ne amaçla ve hangi spesifik probleme çözüm olarak kullanıldığı gibi tecrübelerin çok yararlı olduğunu düşünüyorum. Sektöre yeni başlayan yazılımcı arkadaşlar geliştirecekleri projeler için bu teknolojilerden yararlanabilir veya tecrübeli yazılımcı arkadaşlarımız da listede daha önce duymadıkları bir teknoloji varsa bunlar hakkında bilgi edinebilirler.
Linkwind projesinin geliştiricileri olarak bu projede, daha önce kullanmadığımız yeni teknolojileri kullanmak istedik. Yani bir çoğu bizim için yeni teknolojiler. Belki size tanıdık gelebilir ve projelerinizde aktif olarak zaten kullanıyorsunuzdur ama biz bu teknolojilerin bazılarını ilk defa bu projede deneyimledik. Bu yüzden yan projelerin bu amaç doğrultusunda bile yazılımcılara çok değerli tecrübeler kattığına inanıyorum. Kullanılan teknolojilerle ilgili ilk izlenimlerimizi de fazla detaya girmeden aktarmaya çalışacağım.
Detaylara geçmeden önce kullandığımız teknolojilerin listesine bir göz atalım:
Projeyi tamamen Go programlama dili ile geliştirdik. Back-end tarafında http isteklerini karşılamak için herhangi bir third-party web framework kullanmadık. Go dili ile çok tecrübemiz olmadığı için direkt olarak bir web framework kullanmaktansa Go’nun kendi http paketinin işleyişinin nasıl olduğunu anlamak istedik. Bu sayede varsa Go’nun kendi http paketinin artılarını eksilerini görüp oradaki acıyı deneyimleyerek, geliştirilen third party web frameworklerinin hangi problemleri çözdüğünü daha iyi anlayabiliriz diye düşündük. Böylelikle sonraki projelerde kullanıma değer olup olmadıklarını daha kolay anlayabilirdik.
Front-end tarafında da tüm altyapıyı Go’nun template mekanizması üzerine oturttuk. Go’nun template paketi bir çok temel ihtiyacı karşılıyor. Fakat tüm html sayfalarınızı base bir layout template’i üzerinden sunmak istediğinizde sistem biraz karmaşık gelebilir ama gözünüzü korkutmasın. İşin içine girince alışıyorsunuz:)
Başlarda template dilinde ihtiyacımız olan kodları bulmakta zorlandık açıkçası. Go’nun kendi dokümantasyonunda sadece bazı temel template kodları paylaşılmış fakat hepsinin açıklamarıyla olduğu bir dokümantasyon yoktu veya biz bulamadık. Ama internette biraz araştırma yaptıktan sonra hepsi kolayca bulunabiliyor.
Veritabanı olarak tercihimizi PostgreSQL’den yana kullandık. PostgreSQL bana göre marketteki en iyi veritabanı çözümlerinden bir tanesi. Relational bir veritabanının sağladıkları yanında NoSQL veritabanlarının sağladığı bir çok kolaylığı da sağlıyor. Bunun yanında performansının MySQL ve MSSQL’e göre kat ve kat daha iyi olduğunu gözlemledik.
Go ile postgresql tarafına bağlanırken bir ORM paketi kullanmadık. Go’nun kendi database/sql paketinin üzerine github.com/lib/pq adresindeki PostgreSQL driverini kullandık. Aslında ORM kullanmamamızın amacı yine Go’nun kendi paketini deneyimleyip altyapıyıdaki zorlukları görebilmekti. Edindiğimiz tecrübeye göre ORM paketlerinden birini kullanmak data katmanındaki kod karmaşıklığını azaltıp, tekrar eden bağlantı ve raw SQL kodlarını azaltacaktır. Bu sayede daha temiz bir kod yapısı elde edip ve kod yönetiminizi daha esnek bir hale getirebilirsiniz.
Bulma’yı Linkwind.co websitesini tasarlamak için kullandık. Bootstrap’ı daha önce zaten bir çok projede kullanmıştık ve o yüzden bu projede yeni bir front-end framework’u deneyimlemek istedik. Bulma’nın kullanımı bize çok daha kolay geldi. Grid sistemi Bootstrap’e göre çok daha basit ve anlaşılır.
Framework ayrıca tamamen customize edilebilir bir yapı sunuyor. CSS tarafındaki herşey değişkenlerle yönetilebildiği için renkler vs herşey özelleştirilebiliyor. Ayrıca kullanmak istemediğiniz UI elementlerini CSS’ten çıkararak CSS boyutlarında da büyük bir tasarruf sağlayabiliyorsunuz.
Tailwind’i duymayanınız yoktur heralde. Biz de o kadar çok duyduk ki hazır yeni bir projeye başlıyoruz deyip kullanmak istedik. Tailwind Bootstrap ve Bulma gibi frameworklere göre daha farklı bir css framework’u sunuyor. Şöyle düşünün, bir projede ihtiyacınız olan tüm css yardımcı classlar önceden tanımlanmış ve kullanımınıza hazır hale getirilmiş. Örneğin margın-left: 5px gibi bir css kodu için ml-5 diye bir class varsayılan olarak tanımlı geliyor. Sizin tek yapmanız gereken bu yardımcı css classlarını kullanarak UI’nızı geliştirmek.
Bizim Tailwind’ı kullanma motivasyonlarımızdan ilki bu yeni framework’u deneyimlemek istemekti. İkincisi ise önceki projelerimizde biz de bir çok yardımcı class oluşturup kullandığımız için bize daha yakın bir framework olduğunu düşündük. Tailwind’i Linkwind websitesinin haricinde SAAS tarafındaki web uygulamasında kullandık. Golang ile yazılan back-end’in servis ettiği ve Go’nun tempalate engine’i üzerinde oturtulan UI’da css dokunuşlarının hepsini Tailwind ile yaptık. İtiraf etmeliyim ki responsive sayfa mekanizmasına bir türlü alışamadım. Nedense kavramakta güçlük çektim. Ama ben daha çok back-end tarafına yakın olduğum için bu durum bana özel olabilir.
Takip edip işlerine saygı duyduğum, alanında uzman bir çok Front-end geliştiricisine göre Tailwind’in yapmak istediği inline-style css kodu yazmaktan öteye geçemiyor. Bence belli bir oranda da bu konuda haklılar. Sürekli css yardımcı classlarını kullanmanın inline-style css kullanmaktan pek farkı kalmıyor. O yüzden front-end uzmanlarına kulak verin derim.
Pgadmin’i PostgreSQL üzerinde yarattığımız linkwind veritabanı işlemlerini yönetmek için kullandık. Tablo oluşturma, index oluşturma gibi işlemleri bir arayüz aracılığıyla yapmak istediğimiz için PgAdmin’nin sağladığı kolaylıklardan faydalandık. Hem localimizde hemde server tarafında PgAdmin’i sıklıkla kullandık.
Fresh; Go ile yazılmış web uygulamanızda, herhangi bir go veya template dosyası üzerinde değişiklik yaptığınızda, bu değişiklikleri algılayıp uygulamanızı otomatik olarak derleyip restart ediyor. Bu sayede yaptığınız her değişiklikte tekrar tekrar go uygulamanızı build edip run etmek zorunda kalmıyorsunuz.
Go ile proje kodlamaya başladığımda sürekli yaptığım bu build işlemleri beni çok rahatsız etmişti ve bunu otomasyona bağlamak için biraz araştırma yapmıştım. Github üzerinde bu işi yapan bir çok proje bulabilirsiniz ama fresh bizim işimizi gördü. Belki Go programlamada bizden daha tecrübeli olan arkadaşların daha iyi bir çözümü vardır. Varsa yorumlara yazarsanız sevinirim.
Fresh ile Go uygulamanızı restart etmeyi tetikleyecek dosya formatlarını belirleyebiliyorsunuz. Böylelikle belirlediğiniz dosya formatları üzerinde bir değişiklik olduğu anda Go uygulamanız otomatik olarak yeniden başlatılıyor ve değişikliklerinizi görebiliyorsunuz.
SAAS uygulamasında upvote/downvote ve comment/reply kısımlarında daha iyi bir kullanıcı deneyimi sunmak için back-end tarafında gidecek istekleri javascript ile gerçekleştirmek istedik. Bu yüzden vanillajs’in sunduklarından daha iyi olan, daha organize bir kod yapısına sahip bir kaç javascript çözümü aradık. Jquery kullanmak istemedik çünkü jquery bana göre çok esnek bir kütüphane olmasına rağmen daha structured bir kod sağlamada yetersiz kalıyor. İpin ucunu kaçırıp kod karmaşıklığını arttırma ihtimaliniz çok yüksek.
React veya Vue gibi daha geniş kapsamlı bir framework de kullanmak istemedik. Çözmeye çalıştığımız çok basit bir problem olduğu için gereksiz yere bu kadar kapsamlı frameworkler kullanmak anlamsız olurdu. Bu yüzden Jquery ve React/Vue framewroklerinin arasında kalan mütevazı bir kütüphane bulduk.
Basecamp şirketinin kendi içerisinde kullanıp herkese açık hale gitirdiği bir javascript kütüphanesi. Javascript kodlarınızı bir controller mantığı ile tasarlıyorsunuz. Bu sayede seperation of concerns prensibini ihlal etmeden, daha temiz ve organize olmuş bir kodunuz oluyor. Şunu söylemekte fayda var. Stimulus front-end tarafındaki tüm problemlerinizi çözen bir js kütüphanesi değil. Serverside rendering gibi özellikler de sunmuyor. İhtiyaçlarınıza göre daha kapsamlı bir framework tercih edebilirsiniz.
Tüm hataları loglalayıp bugları yönetmek için Sentry’i kullanıyoruz. Bilmeyenler için neden Sentry’i tercih ettiğimizi söyleyelim. Sentry hataları yönetmek için tek bir merkezi dashboard sunuyor. Takımdaki geliştiriciler farklı hesaplar üzerinden bu dashboarda erişebiliyorlar. Bugları ilgili yazılımcılara atayabiliyorsunuz.
En sevdiğim özelliklerinden bir tanesi de, tekrar tekrar gelen hataları tek bir hata logunun altında toplayıp, bu hatanın toplamda kaç defa geldiği ve kaç farklı kullanıcıdan geldiği gibi bilgileri size sunabiliyor olması. Golang tarafında da sentry implementasyonu çok basit. Bir Sentry hesabı oluşturduktan sonra buradaki dökümantasyona göre Go entegrasyonunu basitçe yapabilirsiniz.
Deployment ile ilgili kullandığımız tüm teknolojilerden bu başlık altında bahsedeceğim. Linkwind.co ve SAAS web uygulamasını DigitalOcean’daki $5'lik bir linux droplet üzerinde host ediyoruz.
Uygulamayı linux sunucusuna deploy etmek için kullanıyoruz. Websitesi, SAAS uygulaması, veritabanı ve Pgadmin için birer docker image yaratıp deploy işlemlerini docker imajlar üzerinden yapıyoruz. Başta docker compose ile uygulamaları tek bir compose dosyası ile orkestre etmek istedik ama tarafında custom işlemlerimiz olduğu için ve bu işleri docker compose tarafında bir türlü beceremedik. Bu yüzden her bir imajı server tarafında ayrı ayrı run ederek deploy etmeye karar verdik.
İmajlar için DockerHub kullanıyoruz.
Linux terminal tarafında fazla uzman olmadığımızdan dolayı, server tarafındaki docker containerları yönetmeyi bir UI üzerinden nasıl yapabiliriz diye arayışa girdik. Biraz araştırmadan sonra karşımıza Portainer diye bir servis çıktı. Containerlarınızın çalıştığı sunucuya portainer imajını kurup bir port üzerinden erişime açmanız Portainer’i ayağa kaldırmak için yeterli oluyor. Ardından bir admin hesabı oluşturduktan sonra tüm containerlarınızın yönetimini Portainer üzerinden yapabiliyorsunuz.
Linkwind websitesini dış dünyaya üzerinden açıyoruz. Diğer docker containerları localde çalışarak belirli portlar üzerinden dışarıya açılıyorlar. Nginx reverse proxy görevi görerek dışarıdan gelen http isteklerini containerlara iletiyor.
SSL sertifika oluşturma ve yenileme işlemlerini Let’s Encrypt ile yönetiyoruz.
Daha önce söylediğim gibi kendi link paylaşım ve tartışma platformunuzu kurmanız için Linkwind üzerinde hesap oluşturduğunuzda size platform-isminiz.linkwind.co isminde bir subdomain tahsis ediliyor. Bütün sub domainler varsayılan olarak https desteği ile geliyor. Bunun teknik detayını buradaki yazıda anlatmıştım. Bu sistemde arka planda Let’s Encrypt kullanıyoruz.
Platformunuz için kendi custom domaininizi kullanmak isterseniz bu da mümkün. Bunun için , ve Lua-resty-auto-ssl servislerinden yararlanıyoruz. Kullanıcılara custom domain kullanma desteğini nasıl verdiğimizi detaylı bir yazıda burada anlatmıştım. Dilerseniz makalemizi okuyarak bu konudaki teknik bilgiyi de edinebilirsiniz.
Sanırım hepsi bu kadar. Linkwind projesini geliştirirken kullandığımız teknolojiler bunlardı. Projeyi geliştirme yolculuğunda bilmediğimiz bir çok yeni şey öğrenip, bir çok yeni teknolojiyle tanışma fırsatımız oldu. Bir yan proje yapmak için motivasyon bulamıyorsanız, yeni teknolojiler öğrenme motivasyonu bile tek başına yeterli. Biz projeyi geliştirirken çok eğlendik. Artık önümüzdeki maçlara bakma zamanı.
Sağlıcakla kalın.

Characteristics of the SaaS X marketplace hybrids
I stumble upon more and more startups launching SaaS products with marketplace dynamics tied to it. These are sometimes referred as “SaaS based marketplaces” meaning that these startups offer a product which the customer uses to run its business (available as a normal SaaS) plus some marketplace features which enable them to connect and transact with suppliers / on-demand workers / freelancers.
The real difference with a pure transactional marketplace (like Airbnb) is that the product is not necessarily 100% focused on the transactions.
A good example of a SaaS based marketplace is Zenefits, an HR tool, which users can use to run their business without touching the “marketplace features” (with health insurance companies). For instance a flat owner won’t use Airbnb to manage its property, all features of the AirBnb product are focused on the transactions with renters.
This approach comes in many flavours: free tool with paid transactions, paid tool and free transactions, both paid tool and transactions.
The first question that we can legitimately ask is whether it’s just a buzzword that I’ll use for the next couple of months or a real trend our industry.
The way I tend to see it is that it’s just a normal step in the evolution of a maturing SaaS industry:
Marketplaces are eating every industry, the B2B world is just the next one on the list. I’m not saying anything groundbreaking here but the marketplace model is part of the internet DNA. It’s eating every online industry, from ecommerce (eBay, Amazon as early as 1995) to mobile (mobile appstores are big marketplaces), music or the sharing economy more recently. The enterprise world traditionally gets hit by innovation waves a bit after the consumer world, this is why we’ll probably see more SaaS X marketplace emerge in the years to come.
Too many SaaS + more and more SaaS consumers = more friction = need fluidification. There’s an ever increasing number of SaaS available (> tens of thousands) and more and more businesses are using them. More and more offer and more and more demand = time for more marketplaces to emerge and fluidify the market.
And the job market needs less friction too. The way businesses (of all sizes) work with freelancers, remote employees or on-demand workers is changing fast. Businesses are not limited to working with accountants, developers, lawyers or marketers who live next door. Whether it’s for small tasks or full time job, it makes sense for SaaS products to not only offer classical “business management” features but also to bundle a marketplace component with it (or for marketplaces to bundle a SaaS product with it, it also works that way).
It’s the same logic: increasing offer and increasing demand results in more friction which is (very often) solved by the marketplace model.
So in my eyes:
A major difference between a “SaaS based marketplace” and a “pure transactional” marketplace is that the former uses its SaaS component as the main way to solve the chicken and egg problem.
Pure transactional marketplaces generally need to grow both demand and offer carefully together to solve the chicken and egg problem whereas SaaS based ones can focus on one side first, by providing a kick ass tool, and then grow the other side.
A good example of this is, again, Zenefits. The startup offers its HR / payroll / benefits tool for free to acquire a maximum of users (the “buyer side”) and then the “seller side” (health insurance companies) can follow more easily, attracted by the critical mass of buyers.
The “SaaS” component is key here because it can really be used as a stand alone tool by the users, without having to contract with health insurance companies on Zenefits directly. In fact I know several startups in the US which use Zenefits without using the “benefits” features at all (where their revenue comes from).
Since the SaaS component will be key in the success of such startups, they will have to make a choice on whether they first focus on the demand (buyers) side or the offer (sellers) side.
This is why you’ll find mainly two different types of SaaS based marketplaces:
Demand oriented marketplaces (= the SaaS component for the buyers):
Offer oriented marketplaces (= the SaaS component for the suppliers):
I have created a mindmap to list more examples => drop me a tweet @clement to add more startups
This choice has many consequences on the marketplace’s approach:
Product
Offering a great value added tool is important especially in such a competitive landscape. This is probably one of the many reasons why Zenefits is so successful: they targeted an industry (payroll — HR benefits) where the “product standard” was still quite low and hence could quickly make an impact with a great product.
It might not be that easy if you start in more competitive (from a product pov) industries such as marketing, sales, CRM… So choosing the right industry + the right side (demand or offer) is crucial for your product development and success.
Marketing, sales & distribution
An interesting addition to the traditional marketing, sales and distribution playbook is that if you manage to delight and lock a user with your tool, there’s a chance that he’ll bring its own suppliers or customers on your platform and hence participate to the acquisition of the other side of the marketplace for you.
Ex: if you like Zenefits software very much you can bring your own health insurance provider to manage your benefits there. If an accountant likes its accounting software very much chances are high that he’ll bring his existing customers on the platform (ex: Xero).
Another interesting aspect is the diversity of the business models involved:
This combination of SaaS X marketplace is very attractive for many reasons (chicken and egg problem, barrier to software commoditization etc…) and Zenefits proved that a fast growing business could be built out of it. So I won’t be surprised to see more of these hybrid startups emerge in the months / years to come.

If you are here in a panic because Google Safe Browsing has blacklisted your website or SaaS, skip ahead to the section describing how to handle the situation. There's also a lot of very interesting comments on the Hacker News comments page.
In the old days, when Google (or any poorly tuned AI that Google unleashed) decided it wanted to kill your business, it would usually resort to denying access to one of its multiple walled gardens, and that was that. You've probably heard the horror stories:
They all fit the same mold. First, a business, by choice, uses Google services in a way that makes its survival entirely dependent on them. Second, Google, being the automated behemoth that Google is, does its thing: it ever so slightly adjusts the position of its own butt on its planet sized leather armchair, and, without really noticing, crushes a myriad of (relatively) ant-sized businesses in the process. Third, and finally, the ant-sized businesses desperately try to inform Google that they are being crushed, but they can only reach an automated suggestions box.
Sometimes, the ant-sized CEO knows a higher up at Google because they were college buddies, or the CTO writes an ant-sized Medium post that somehow makes it to the front page of Hacker News mound. Then Google notices the ant-sized problem and sometimes deems it worthy of solving, usually for fear of regulatory repercussions that the ant revolution might entail.
For this reason, conventional ant-sized wisdom dictates that if possible, you should not build your business to be overly reliant on Google's services. And if you manage to avoid depending on Google's multiple walled gardens to survive, you will probably be OK.
In today's episode of ""the Internet is not what it used to be"", let's talk about a fresh new avenue for Google to inadvertently crush your startup that does not require you to use Google services in any (deliberate) way.
Did you know that it's possible for your site's domains to be blacklisted by Google for no particular reason, and that this blacklist is not only enforced directly in Google Chrome, but also by several other software and hardware vendors? Did you know that these other vendors synchronize this list with wildly variable timings and interpretations, in a way that can make fixing any issues extremely stressful and unpredictable? Did you know that Google's ETA for reviewing a blacklist report, no matter how invalid, is measured in weeks?
This blacklist ""feature"" is called Google Safe Browsing, and the image here depicts the subtle message your users will see if one of your domains happens to be flagged in the Safe Browsing database. Warning texts range from ""deceptive site ahead"" to ""the site ahead contains malware"" (see here for a full list), but they all share an equally scary red background design, and borderline impossible UI for people to skip the warning and use the site anyway.
The first time we experienced this issue, we learned about it from a surge of customer reports that said that they were seeing the red warning page when trying to use our SaaS. The second time, we were better prepared and therefore had some free time to write this post.
For context, InvGate (our company) is a SaaS platform for IT departments that runs on AWS with over 1000 SME and enterprise customers, serving millions of end users. This means our product is used by IT teams to manage issues and requests from their own users. You can imagine the pleasant reaction of IT Managers when suddenly their IT ticketing system starts displaying such ominous security warnings to their end users.
When we first bumped into this problem, we frantically tried to understand what was going on and learning how Google Safe Browsing (GSB from now on) worked while our technical support team tried to keep up with customers reporting the issue. We quickly realized an Amazon Cloudfront CDN URL that we used to serve static assets (CSS, Javascript and other media) had been flagged and this was causing our entire application to fail for the customer instances that were using that particular CDN. A quick review of the allegedly affected system showed that everything appeared normal.
While our DevOps team was working in full emergency mode to get a new CDN set up and preparing to move customers over onto a new domain, I found that Google's documentation claims that GSB provides additional explanations about why a site has been flagged in the Google Search Console (GSC from now on) of the offending site. I won't bore you with the details, but in order to access this information, you have to claim ownership of the site in GSC, which requires you to set up a custom DNS record or upload some files onto the root of the offending domain. We scrambled to do exactly that and after 20 minutes, managed to find the report about our site.
The report looked something like this:
The report also contained a ""Request Review"" button that I promptly clicked without actually taking any action on the site, since there was no information whatsoever about the alleged problem. I filed for a review with a message noting that there were no offending URLs listed, despite documentation indicating that example URLs are always be provided by Google to assist webmasters in identifying issues.
Around an hour later, and before we had finished moving customers out of that CDN, our site was cleared from the GSB database. I received an automated email confirming that the review had been successful around 2 hours after that fact. No clarification was given about what caused the problem in the first place.
Over the week that followed this incident, and despite having had our URL cleared from the Safe Browsing blacklist, we continued to receive sporadic reports of companies having trouble to access our systems.
Google Safe Browsing provides two different APIs for both commercial and non-commercial software developers to use the blacklist in their products. In particular, we identified that at least some customers using Firefox were also running into issues, and both antivirus/antimalware software and network-wide security appliances from customers were also flagging our site and preventing users from accessing it many days after the issue had been resolved.
We continued to move all the customers off the formerly blacklisted CDN and onto a new one, and the issue was therefore resolved for good. We never properly established the cause of the issue, but we chalked it up to some AI tripping on acid at Google's HQ.
My 2 cents: If you run a SaaS business with an availability SLA, getting flagged by Google Safe Browsing for no particular reason represents a very real risk to business continuity.
Sadly, given the oh-so-Googly opacity of the mechanism for flagging and reviewing sites, I don't think there is a way you can fully prevent this from happening to you. But you can certainly architect your app and processes to minimize the chances of it happening, lower the impact of actually being flagged, and minimize the time needed to circumvent the issue if it arises.
Here are the steps we are taking, and I therefore recommend:
Here's what I would recommend:
The second time around, months after the first incident, we received an email from the Search Console warning us that one of our domains had been flagged. A few hours after this initial email report, being a G Suite domain administrator, I received another interesting email, which you can read below.
Let me summarize what that is, because it’s quite mind blowing. This email refers to the Search Console blacklist alert emails. What this second e-mail says is that G Suite’s automated phishing e-mail filter thinks Google Search Console’s email about our domain being blacklisted is fake. It most certainly is not, since our domain was indeed blacklisted when we received the email. So Google can’t even decide whether its own email alerts about phishing are phishing. (LOL? 🤔)
It's very clear to anyone working in tech that large corporate technology behemoths are to a great extent, gatekeepers of the Internet. But I tend to interpret that in a loose, metaphorical way. The Safe Browsing incident described in this post made it very clear that Google literally controls who can access your website, no matter where and how you operate it. With Chrome having around 70% market share, and both Firefox and Safari using the GSB database to some extent, Google can with a flick of a bit singlehandedly make any site virtually inaccessible on the Internet.
This is an extraordinary amount of power, and one that is not suitable for Google's ""an AI will review your problem when and if it finds it convenient to do so"" approach.

This post is part of our series covering the SaaS industry. You can find all our SaaS related stories on the P9 Capital Medium Channel.
The small & medium business (SMB) segment is a very attractive one for many SaaS founders. In the US alone there were 5.6 million SMBs in 2011 (= businesses with less than 500 employees) with 90% of them having less than 20 employees (= 5 million). In France, out of a total of 3.1M businesses in 2011, 128k had between 10 and 250 employees and 3M had less than 10 employees. Same for Germany with more than 2M SMBs.
A very common strategy, when starting on the SMB segment, is to first focus on a niche, to dominate it and once successful to expand.
If the first phase of this strategy is relatively feasible for many SaaS products, it’s a whole other story when it comes to really scale it.
One of the biggest challenges is to scale distribution / acquisition. Since targeting SMBs implies having a low price point, you need to acquire as many customers as possible without spending too much for each of them. And since the SMB segment is a very fragmented one (see it as a collection of niches rather than a big coherent market) it can be a daunting task.
This why when you analyse the strategy of software companies which are really strong on this segment you’ll notice that a common strategy is not to target the end customers directly but to focus on where you can get a “bunch of them” at once.
Xero, an accounting SaaS for SMBs, puts a lot of effort in acquiring accounting firms. Since each accounting firm works with an average of 13 small businesses, it’s faster to scale acquisition by convincing the accountant to migrate its own customers to Xero.
Stripe is another great example. They provide the payment platform to websites like Twitch (video games streaming) and each user of Twitch has to create a Stripe account if he wants to collect money.
A more overlooked challenge is the product one. The advantage of starting with a niche rather than having a “global” approach is that you can develop a product which will answer the precise needs of your customers. From feature prioritisation to UX/UI choices your product development will stick to these needs and in many cases it will be easier to outdo the competition.
But in the SMB segment, very often, what works for a specific type of customers might not work for another one because their needs are slightly different. This is why you find a lot of feature overlap and feature creep in products for SMBs.
Like the “contact management” feature which you probably have in your sales tool, CRM tool, invoicing tool, support tool… A “sales heavy” business might need to manage its contact directly its sales tool while other types of businesses might prefer to do it in their CRM or marketing tools (they’ll use the sales tool only for the sales pipe feature). This is why you end up having the contact management feature everywhere, even if, ideally, you would need it only once but with clever integrations to let data flow between tools.
Product management for SMB software is an extremely difficult exercise once you start to change gears from “niche” to ”global”. Appealing to a specific target is doable, appealing to many is much harder.
When you want to grow bigger than your niche the competition can become much fiercer. As we’ve explained, it’s easier to outdo the competition (in terms of product) when you focus on a niche, but once you go global you are suddenly competing with:
The beauty of the current SaaS environment is that it has never been easier to launch a niche product and to live out of it. Many SaaS founders / small teams make a decent living this way and the “lifestyle” SaaS companies trend will probably only grow (which is fantastic for the majority of founders).
But if you choose the path of the “growth company” then you’ll face totally different challenges.

Investors in SaaS are lucky to have plenty of metrics to measure, because those metrics are good proxies for important business decisions.
When do you hit product market-fit? How do you grow in the future? How much capital should you raise? You can look at metrics to answer that!
About this seriesThis series of articles are drafted from our experience at Point Nine Capital on the top priorities for early-stage SaaS companies. Note that though more relevant for startups who focus on SMBs first and then go upmarket, the priorities are general enough to apply to most SaaS companies.
Looking top down, for SaaS companies everything is about growth and retention — capital efficiency is also important, but for VC-funded companies, that’s subordinated to the other two.
If it’s about growth and retention, what are the metrics that reflect?
Clearly, MRR Growth and Churn are the kings.
But depending on the stage of your company, you face different challenges:
The more mature the company, the larger the number of metrics and sub-metrics that are measurable and meaningful. You can look at MRR growth as the result of (a) growth at the top of the funnel, (b) the different conversions in the funnel, (c) the ARPAs of different account sizes, (d) the degrees of expansion, etc.
Once your funnel is bigger, an apparently small optimization can have significant results at the bottom. The challenge here is not about getting access to the data, but rather segmenting it and making the right attributions.
At a very early stage, you will not have enough data to calculate those metrics. Or if you have it, they will be not statistically relevant or very volatile.
But even if you’re not able to measure them accurately, you can find good proxies for them.
At an early stage, you can only measure the actions you do, the inputs — you can write blog posts, you can send emails to potential customers, etc. — because you still don’t have enough data to have expectations about the results, the outputs — volumes, conversions, etc.
At this stage, when you choose what to measure, you should look for stuff that is actionable in the short term.
The feedback between your input and the output should come quickly, like in the following examples:
At this stage, the only thing you can measure is the effort you put. Sometimes the results will be correlated with that, sometimes not.
But if you don’t have a clear framework on what direction you want to go, you can put effort and don’t get the right results.
Since this is series of posts is about prioritisation, here the 3 key topics I suggest measuring:
NPS is the best tool today to measure customer’s happiness. As soon as you have enough customers (10s) or users (100s) go for it.
But what if you’re smaller?
Then, you need to understand what’s your Key Product Metric: What’s the metric that tells you that you’re providing value to your customers?
Three examples from our portfolio:
How do you drive growth in that metric?
The priority is to optimize for this metric at the different steps of the funnel and that’s a job of everybody at the company:
If you put focus on driving growth in that metric, you will then figure out which ones are the blockers for conversion at the different steps of your funnel. If you remove them, then growth will follow.
Monitoring that metric also tells you how happy your existing customers are. If you see them decreasing usage, you will get a good predictor of churn.
The good thing about all of that is that you can measure your progress on a weekly basis. Improving one step of the funnel today 50%, when it’s small, might not have a big impact; but later on, 50% more conversions later will mater a lot…
If you want to dig into this, my colleague Nicolas Wittenborn has some examples here and Mamoon Hamid also published about the topic here.
As soon as you get customers, you must solve churn.
At least for a segment of your customers. Remember:
In any case, you should figure out quickly if there is a segment of customers that don’t churn. If that’s not the case, it can become pretty hard to run a SaaS business for the scale required in VC.
One exception to that can be if virality drives your growth. If your business is like Trello, Typeform or Slack, then you can post-pone the discussion for a while. Just. Don’t. Forget. It.
In general, churn can be due to:
So, solving churn is a strategic decision that might require pivots and the full attention of the founders.
A startup is a company designed to grow fast. — Paul Graham.
Or … if you don’t grow, you’re not a startup? ;-)
In a SaaS company, the metric that captures growth best is MRR growth — while churn is the ‘anti-MRR growth’.
At this very early stage, you should start measuring growth, but don’t get obsessed about it.
Now is about learning, not about growing at any cost.
Now is time to define and test hypotheses about customers’ problems, to measure the steps and conversions of the funnel, to try different growth experiments, etc.
That, until you see that you can add a couple of thousands of MRR every month or you grew into around 10k MRR.
Then, the race starts…

Be the first to respond.
This is part one of my three-part series, taking a deep-dive into SaaS pricing strategy. I’ll be covering key pricing models, strategies for hitting your growth goals, and psychological hacks for optimising revenue.
Click to read the complete post, or download as a PDF.
Finding the right balance between value and revenue — your ability to help customers and be fairly compensated for that help — will make or break your SaaS company.
Undercharge, and you’ll cripple your business with uncompensated development and delivery costs; overcharge, and you’ll throttle your growth and drive away thousands of would-be customers.
To help you get the most from your SaaS product, I’m looking at the seven major SaaS pricing models, and exploring the pros and cons of each.
Whether you’re tied-up in tiered pricing or frustrated by freemium, the pricing models covered here should help you identify the optimum way to market, sell and grow your SaaS business.
Flat rate pricing is probably the simplest way to sell a SaaS solution: you offer a single product, a single set of features, and a single price.
In this way, flat rate pricing bears a lot of similarities to the software licensing model used before cloud infrastructure existed, but with the added benefit of (usually) being billed monthly.
Examples of flat rate pricing are few and far between (the most famous example from recent years, Buffer’s Awesome plan, is now one of many pricing packages the company offer) — but the practice is still used by eCommerce SaaS CartHook.
A single monthly price of $300 (or $2,400 billed annually) grants access to all features of the company’s product:
Also known as the Pay As You Go model, this type of pricing strategy directly relates the cost of a SaaS product to its usage: if you use more of the service, your bill goes up; use less, and your spend decreases.
In practice, this pricing strategy is most common within infrastructure- and platform-related software companies (like Amazon Web Services), where companies are charged based on the number of API requests, transactions processed, or gigabytes of data used.
Increasingly though, SaaS companies are finding new ways to adapt the model, like social media tools that charge for scheduled posts, or accounting tools that charge per invoice.
Usage based pricing works particularly well for recurring billing platforms like Chargify: by directly correlating price with revenue, you can guarantee that price increases only happen alongside periods of increased revenue, ensuring that customers will always be able to afford and justify the change in price:
Flat rate and usage based pricing are relatively uncommon in mainstream SaaS, and it’s tiered pricing which is the de facto model used by most companies. At its heart, tiered pricing allows companies to offer multiple “packages”, with different combinations of features offered at different price points.
The average number of packages on offer can vary hugely, but the average clocks in 3.5 — often geared towards low, middle and high price points.
SaaS content marketing company HubSpot employ tiered pricing to great effect: each tier is designed around the needs (and budget) of a different type of potential customer, ranging from “those new to Inbound marketing” to “professional marketers” and “marketing teams”:
Spend a few minutes browsing pricing pages and you’ll come away with the impression that Per User Pricing (also known as Per Seat Pricing) is the go-to SaaS pricing model.
Pacific Crest’s annual SaaS survey backs-up these findings: across the companies surveyed, per user pricing was the most popular pricing model used:
This popularity can largely be attributed to simplicity: a single user pays a fixed monthly price; add another user, and that price doubles; add a third user and, you guessed it, the monthly cost trebles.
This makes it extremely easy for customers to understand what their monthly subscription buys them, and easy for SaaS startups to manage and predict their revenue.
For an archetypal use case of per user pricing, look no further than roadmapping SaaS ProductPlan. The only variable in their Business Plan is the number of users added to the account, and the per use price is the same, whether you’re a single user or a team of 100.
One variant of the per user pricing model is active user pricing. Many SaaS companies (particularly those targeting the enterprise) encourage yearly billing cycles. This can mean that a new customer could pay for hundreds of employees, up-front — without any guarantee that those employees would actually use the software.
Per active user pricing tackles this problem head-on, encouraging customers to sign-up as many users as possible, with the safeguard that only active users will actually be billed for.
Slack are the most famous example of this SaaS pricing model: no matter how many users you pay for, you’ll only be charged for those that actually use the software.
At Slack, you only get billed for what you use. So you don’t pay for the users that aren’t using Slack. And if someone you’ve already paid for becomes inactive, we’ll even add a prorated credit to your account for the unused time. Fair’s fair.
Slack
For the previous two SaaS pricing models, users were the common variable, but it’s completely possible to use features as your value metric instead.
Per feature pricing separates out different pricing tiers according to the functionality available in each, with the higher priced packages associated with a greater number of available features.
The primary differentiator between Evernote’s Basic, Plus and Premium packages is the different range of features on offer, with new functionality “unlocked” with each upgrade.
Thanks to high-profile success stories like Slack, Evernote and Dropbox, many SaaS companies use freemium pricing: offering a free-to-use product, supplemented by additional paid packages.
The freemium business model is typically used as part of a tiered pricing strategy: the regular paid packages are supplemented with a free, entry-level tier.
That tier is then limited across certain dimensions in order to encourage users to upgrade at a certain level of usage, typically employing feature-based (if you want X feature, you need a paid package), capacity-based (if you exceed your allowance, you’ll need a paid package) or use-case (you can use the free package internally, but not for managing customers) limitations.
Live chat SaaS Drift use freemium pricing to great effect.
Their “Free” package allows small companies to talk to their first 100 contacts for free: when demand for the service increases beyond that point (most likely correlating with company and revenue growth), it becomes necessary to upgrade to their paid packages.

Over the last 8 years, the only way to describe the rise of B2B SaaS is to say that it’s exploded.
In less time than it takes to become a doctor, the software industry became consumerized; designers fought for a seat at the table, got it, and brought with them a focus on UX; and Hubspot developed inbound marketing as a strategy that really works.
With all of that inbound marketing from all of those rising SaaS companies, there’s a lot of noise. Some said we reached ‘peak content’ years ago. Folks spun up blogs because that’s “how you do content”. Content marketers were taught to write for keywords—and nothing else.
The whole thing became a way to game the system to get more eyeballs.
Every once and a while, a company stands out. Their content marketing doesn’t feel like ‘content’ or marketing—instead it’s just insanely helpful and honest. It grabs the reader through their screen and makes them feel seen and understood.
But those cases seem to be frustratingly few and far between. In most other experiences, a reader will click on an article and might never actually get to read it because of the war-of-the-widgets that takeover their screen.

Too often, trying to read something on the internet is a confusing and frustrating experience—an experience just like old, legacy enterprise software used to be.
We, as content marketers, have forgotten about—or possibly never considered—the user experience of content.
Here’s the thing—the reason why content and inbound marketing works is that it is inherently helpful. It taps into our desire as humans to reciprocate generosity.
Content is also particularly powerful in that it can solve the hard problems, nuanced problems, and interpersonal team problems that your product can’t. Content can deep dive into how to navigate your career or how to rally your team around an organizational change. It can teach people, make people feel like they belong, like they have a community of people just like them.
I’ll draw my line in the sand here: Just as software companies realized that good UX is good for business (and dark patterns are horrendous and unethical), it’s time that marketing has an overhaul, too.
Good content is good for business.
To put it simply, we’re obsessed with growing metrics.
Listen, I get it. Content is a long game and can be a bit nebulous—especially top-of-the-funnel content. Reporting is important. Showing growth is important. There’s a lot of pressure on content marketing to deliver, yesterday. After all, content wouldn’t exist without the company behind it.
But it’s a balancing act—one that requires constant monitoring. It requires conversations and trade-offs between short term business goals and long term community-building goals. (And I’d bet my career that prioritizing community-building goals is good for long term business goals).
If you’re reading this article panicked about the experience of your own content, remember that none of us have totally figured it out yet. We’re all on a spectrum, and the work is never done.
The good news is that there’s a full discipline out there that is already thinking about and writing about this topic. All we marketers have to do is turn to the design world to learn about respecting a user’s (or in our case, reader’s) flow.
If you’re interested in making your content more truly helpful, here are a few things to start thinking about:
My passion for thinking about the UX of content marketing has made for some lively debates over my career. I urge you to not shy away from them.
Ultimately, cultivating real-deal human empathy on the internet is the secret sauce behind SaaS success. That’s why design-led companies are winning. Reach beyond the screen and make someone feel like you’ve thought about them, like they are more than just an anonymous tick on your analytics scorecard. Use technology to bring people closer together rather than “forcing them down the funnel”.
I’ll leave you with my last pep talk: Marketers, trust in your product-market fit. Educate and offer assistance to folks that would be great users of your product. Stay front of mind by helping them again and again. Then, trust that they’ll try you when they need you.
P.S. A very special thank you to Kate Harvey for encouraging me to finish this post that’s been in drafts for months and for providing pre-publication feedback and edits.

Monyog is a MySQL monitoring tool that gives DBAs real-time insights for optimizing the performance of MySQL servers. It was designed with the focus to provide a unified view of the health, security & performance of the entire MySQL server environment. But as the company grew, a new vision evolved: to create a simplified and efficient technological environment for companies across the globe.
While the original product served as a great tool for over 10 years, the new one had to be an even more Simple, Secure and Scalable tool making it as easy as humanly possible for companies to manage their servers and databases. The entire tool had to be re-designed from scratch. The entire codebase had to be re-written. It had to be built in such a way that the 35,000 companies across the globe already using the old product could migrate to the new product without any data loss.
My role was to define the product strategy (the WHAT & the WHY) and to design the new Monyog — the tool which was going to make the working life of DBAs simpler & more productive.
The goal was to create a new Monyog that would work for large enterprises who have deployed hundreds of MySQL servers to small businesses with only a handful of MySQL servers. To create something for everyone, we risked helping no one. There needed to be constraints to prevent this from happening. So we did a whole load of user research to decide on which targets to aim at. We interviewed our existing customers and spoke to our sales & support teams. This helped us identify what key areas needed focus.
“How do I see the queries running for the last two hours?”
“What queries were running when this peak occurred?”
Charts are the heart of Monyog. But most of the users interviewed felt that the Charts tab is very confusing and doesn’t do what they expect on a basic level from it. Most of them felt that with so many charts for different servers along with so many view & filtering options, the information presented is overwhelming but not-at-all intuitive. A major group also complained about the inability to zoom into a single chart or view the queries from the time-range selected on a chart. They also requested for more customization options for individual charts related to resizing, viewing specific charts, etc.
“Where do I search for a specific server?”
All the users interviewed felt that displaying too many servers made it hard to navigate and have a granular view. Searching or scrolling through the large number of servers in the list both tagged or untagged was quite painful. Also they felt the need for an option to see all the activity going on in a server at a single place along with the ability to customize them with ease.
“How do I set a warning alert for this?”
Almost 80% of the users interviewed used Monitors on a daily basis. But they felt that setting up alerts and configuring email notifications using the same was very painful. The graphs in the Monitors section were almost impossible to customize & appear in conflict with the ones in the Charts section, thus very confusing. Some users complained that comparing trends for two different metrics for different servers was not possible in a single graph and needed the same. Others also requested to make setting up alerts and generating reports to be easy, as expected from Monyog.
“Monyog is powerful, complex and unwieldy. It has all the features required and more, but it’s not intuitive.”
“The interface is too busy. It is difficult to understand the workflow.”
“Which are the top 5 queries across all servers?”
“How do I see the slow queries running at this point?”
Monyog is extensive with fast switching capability. This is its biggest advantage. But this left the user with very less customization option. The user had to scan through too much data which is sometimes not even desired by him in the first place. There were some minor usability and interface issues also as told by users. Wayback Machine was useful but the interface and layout made it hard to use. The interface was very distracting in case of processlist and left the user puzzled. Query Analyzer presented all the demanded queries at once and left it to the user to figure out what to do with those.
The findings of the user research brought to light the crucial places where Monyog was lagging. After processing the insights we defined a few design principles to help guide design decisions.
Avoid the Visibility Gap
The new Monyog needs to help uncover valuable MySQL server performance insights within minutes. From getting a bird’s-eye view of the data tier to blowing up a particular chart to identify what caused a spike, the user experience must be seamless.
Achieve Faster Resolution Time
The new Monyog needs to make monitoring MySQL databases easy. It must help users uncover the problematic queries across the server setup and fix performance problems in the complex data layer without much mind-boggling.
Large Server Clusters over Small
The new Monyog needs to work for everyone ranging from enterprises to small businesses to home users. But the features and the information architecture must be designed with DBAs monitoring server clusters on the range of 500–1000 in mind.
The design insights & principles helped a lot to drive the design and development process of the new Monyog. Each time I was stuck on how to approach a problem, I’d come back to the principles for helping me get on track.
Here’s a sneak peak to how the new Monyog shaped up.

How fast do you need to grow prior to exit? We looked at the last 36 SaaS IPO’s going back to MongoDB’s IPO in October 2017. The data is below.
On median, these companies grew revenue 48% from the prior year, while the average was 55%. Median overall revenue was $180mm while the average was $331mm (that average is skewed by names like McAfee which had $2.6bln of revenue). A few other observations.
The fastest growers were triple digit. The fastest growers had triple digit year over year growth. Snowflake led the way with 174% YOY growth followed by Livongo at 122%. Snowflake’s growth was especially impressive since it IPO’d with $265mm in revenue (Livongo had $68mm). Livongo’s revenue was the lowest of the group.
For an IPO, revenue needs to be $100mm+. Only Livongo ($68m) and ON24 ($89mm) had revenue below $100mm at the time of IPO.
Slow growth is allowed. You can grow slowly and still go public. SurveyMonkey grew only 6%, McAfee grew only 9%, and ON24 grew 8%. Granted, the revenue of these businesses is sufficiently large, and their revenue multiples are quite low relative to peers.
Comparison to privates. Is it fair to compare public IPO to private M&A exits? Not really, but public data is the most transparent and honest data available. We also see similar dynamics in venture: respectable exits happen when sufficiently large companies ($8mm+ of ARR) are growing 30%+ YOY.

One of the common questions early-stage SaaS startups have is what types of content to create in order to attract more visitors and convert them to trial users or paying customers.

Let’s face it: most startups are a shitshow. Perhaps the most pervasive problem afflicting venture-backed startups, once they achieve a basic level of product-market fit, is managing the organizational chaos that results from rapid growth. Almost by definition, this is a chronic challenge of Series A-C stage startups since the rapid expansion of the team to chase a new market opportunity is the purpose of that venture funding in the first place. During this time, the growing pains of the startup will reach such a crescendo that the founders and board will cry out as one, “we need a COO!”
As with any potential problem in a startup, it is possible to posit that a perfect hire could solve that problem, but the more direct route is simply to solve it yourself. Putting your startup on an operating cadence is the way to do that. The Cadence is an operating philosophy that I first learned as COO of PayPal (during the so-called “PayPal Mafia” founding era) and then adapted for SaaS as founder/CEO of Yammer, which Microsoft acquired in 2012 for $1.2 billion. To this day, Yammer is still the fastest unicorn exit among SaaS startups, and a lot of that success is due to the Cadence. The Cadence helped us scale to almost 500 employees and $56 million in annual sales in 4 years.
The Cadence is most needed when scaling from 50 to 500 employees. This is when a pivotal transition in the way the startup operates is required. Before then, all of the employees fit into a single room (either physically or virtually), everyone knows what everyone else is working on, and founders can easily run around telling everyone what to build and what to do.
But at around 50 employees, this approach stops scaling. So the org chart is broken into silos for sales, marketing, customer support, and other functions, and product managers are hired to guide the development process. These new levels of hierarchy create a feeling of compartmentalization and disconnect in the organization. Meanwhile, a lack of leadership for some functions creates a sense of disorganization. Disconnect plus disorganization equals chaos. Ironically, the better the startup is doing, the more chaos there is. This is one of the few startup problems that growth doesn’t solve — in fact, it’s caused by growth.
Ironically, the better the startup is doing, the more chaos there is. This is one of the few startup problems that growth doesn’t solve — in fact, it’s caused by growth.
The Cadence is designed to synchronize the major functions of a SaaS startup so that the team works together in lockstep. It brings order to the chaos; it turns the shitshow into an army. It brings together disconnected areas so everyone understands what is happening and what they should work on. It replaces erratic release dates and sales targets with concrete milestones for shipping and selling. The impact of hitting those milestones, quarter after quarter, has a huge compounding effect on the performance of the business and its culture.
So what is the Cadence? It’s based on a few simple insights:
This is a simple approach that every startup can use, yet few actually do. Let’s describe each function and then how they fit together.
Sales and Finance are the first two functions that work together on a calendar.
For the early-stage startup that is still doing everything ad hoc, moving to a written quarterly sales plan instantly makes the sales team feel better. Constant changes to quotas and territories undermine morale. Putting the team on a predictable quarterly cycle instills confidence that the goalposts won’t change.
Why is quarterly the right tempo? Annual quotas are too slow to judge performance in a startup and don’t easily allow for mid-course adjustments. By contrast, monthly sales are too volatile to impose a monthly quota for individual sales reps. Unless the startup has an extraordinarily quick and predictable sales cycle, a quarterly quota is the Goldilocks plan.
Once sales is on a quarterly plan, the sales leadership can create a series of milestones within the quarter. Every quarter should begin with a Sales Kickoff (“SKO”). At that kickoff, the sales team receives their new quotas, commission plans, and territories. Learnings and best practices from the most effective sales reps are shared across the group. Product managers present the latest product changes as well as the product roadmap. (Since SaaS startups are selling ongoing subscriptions, not just today’s version of the product, it’s important that every sales rep be able to sell the roadmap and vision.) PM involvement in SKO is an important opportunity for cross-functional collaboration.
The second month of the quarter revolves around pipeline inspections. Sales leaders make sure the team is on track to hit their goal, advise reps how to close deals, and help make adjustments. Meanwhile, the marketing and product teams are generating news, awards, and recognition (described further below) that sales can use to warm up prospects and put deals over the top. In the third month, the sales team should be heads-down on closing and making their number.
Every company runs on a fiscal year as an accounting requirement. This finance calendar should be synchronized with the sales calendar for reporting reasons. When the books close on a fiscal quarter, the numbers should reflect a complete quarter’s sales activity, not an incomplete mid-quarter picture. The leadership and board will have a much better sense of what’s happening in the business if sales plans are snapped to fiscal quarters.
There are two choices for the fiscal year. The most standard is a December 31 year-end. However, many sales-driven companies choose a January 31 year-end to avoid closing out the year during the Christmas-to-New Year period. Invariably, a lot of deals come down to the wire, and it’s miserable to be scrambling to hit the number when everyone is on vacation. Smart customers also know to demand discounts at the end of the year. Vendors improve their leverage if reps aren’t under pressure to hit quota at this time. If these reasons apply, I recommend a January 31 fiscal year-end. This means that sales quarters will end in January, April, July, and October. Similarly, it means that Sales Kickoffs will occur in February, May, August, and November.
Board meetings should also be snapped to the Sales-Finance calendar to ensure that the Board reviews sales results while the data is fresh. Ideally, board meetings occur two to three weeks after the end of the previous quarter. So on a January 31 fiscal year, Board meetings will occur in February, May, August, and November. Preparing for those meetings will preoccupy the finance team during this time. More pieces of the SaaS calendar are falling into place.
In the same way that Sales and Finance work together on one calendar, Product and Marketing work together on another calendar.
In order to scale software development, startups create multiple independent dev teams working in parallel, with a product manager assigned to each major product area or strategic priority. Ideally the PMs own and manage their own product roadmaps in a decentralized way. However, the overall product roadmap should get reprioritized and resourced quarterly as part of a formal PM and design review process.
This review should ensure that every project that goes into development can be shipped within one quarter. The rule we had at Yammer is that projects would be assigned 2 to 10 engineers for 2 to 10 weeks. Similar to Jeff Bezos’ two-pizza rule, this meant that the absolute biggest strategic priority could get 10 engineers for 10 weeks. If the product couldn’t ship in that time, it needed to be shrunk down to something more MVP. This requirement improves the reliability of release dates and allows for user feedback before over-investing in a new product.
A good analogy for product management is filling a jar with rock, pebbles, and sand. The rocks are new products, pebbles are features, and the sand are small fixes. If you want to fit the most stuff in the jar, you put the rocks in first, then the pebbles, then the sand. If you put the sand in first, somehow there’s not enough room for the rocks. Product management is like that. It’s about resource planning — maximizing the amount of stuff that you can push through the system with a fixed amount of resources. You will actually fit more through your roadmap by planning the rocks on a quarterly cadence.
When rapidly scaling startups don’t have effective product management, one of two things happens. First, they just ship sand. They polish and fix bugs and usability issues, but they don’t ship tentpole features, new products, and major releases. Or when they do, they end up going wildly over schedule. A product that was supposed to take one quarter will still be in development multiple quarters later. “V2”s that were supposed to take a couple of quarters end up being years late and paralyze the company. This happens because the product was never scoped correctly. The quarterly discipline ensures that you do big stuff — rocks, not just sand — while scoping correctly. None of this is to say that code can’t be shipped weekly or even daily for code management reasons, but PM planning should revolve around quarterly or seasonal releases.
Now that you know there will be a major quarterly product release, you can plan marketing around that. This is why marketing and product are on the same calendar. Startups are product driven, and most news that the company puts out will feed off of new product releases.
A quarterly tempo works well for marketing. It’s more compelling to aggregate news into four big “lightning strikes” than to release it in dribs and drabs over 52 weeks. The lightning strike combines live product demos with news about customers, financing, market share, metrics, or other milestones. Using a launch event to focus the world’s attention is a simple trick that has been foundational to the success of Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Marc Benioff. If event-based marketing has been effective for the most successful founder/CEOs in the history of our industry, why aren’t you doing it? Just putting out press releases doesn’t penetrate the clutter.
Using a launch event to focus the world’s attention is a simple trick that has been foundational to the success of Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Marc Benioff. If event-based marketing has been effective for the most successful founder/CEOs in the history of our industry, why aren’t you doing it?
Launch events are a critical part of the Cadence. It’s not just about the external marketing value: There’s a huge internal benefit from setting dates and deadlines in order to hit a public launch. If the team at Tesla knows that Elon is going on stage to present the Model 3, they have to hit those deadlines. The same is true with Marc Benioff at Dreamforce. Sending your CEO onstage to showcase a new product is tremendously motivating for the team inside the company. The date has been set, the invites have gone out, the world is waiting, and there’s no choice but to hit the goal.
Launch events also force company leaders to think about prioritization in a different way. They know they will have to go on stage to present the new product and explain why it matters. This forces the leader of the startup to think months in advance about what is going to be important to customers. This makes the Product-Marketing System more like the Sales-Finance System in the sense of being customer-centric. Sales doesn’t work unless the customer buys what you’re selling. That’s a good dynamic because you get market feedback. Similarly, having to think about the customer reaction while you’re planning the product calendar is a great thought-exercise for the company.
For startups, I recommend one user conference per year and three smaller webinars or city events. The events don’t all have to be huge; the point is to force discipline and make sure that what you’re working on matters. In the age of Covid, it is fine for these to be virtual events or webinars. What’s most important is having an audience.
If you have product-market fit sufficient to raise a series A or B and are scaling from 50 to 500 employees, you have a fan base. You can engage this community. It may start small. It may only be a few dozen people at the first event, but it will grow.
A common objection I get from founders is that they think no one is going to come to their event. That was my fear at Yammer when we did our first annual user conference called YamJam. But even in our second year as a startup, enough customers, prospects, and industry observers showed up to fill a hotel ballroom. If you have product-market fit sufficient to raise a series A or B and are scaling from 50 to 500 employees, you have a fan base. You can engage this community. It may start small. It may only be a few dozen people at the first event, but it will grow. Just look at Dreamforce: starting from modest beginnings, it is now the largest tech conference.
Now it’s time to snap these two systems together. In bringing the two calendars together, it’s important to offset the peaks. The Sales-Finance System culminates with the quarterly close, and the Product-Marketing System is oriented around the launch event. You want to space out these key events by about half a quarter apart to avoid lighting everyone’s hair on fire at the same time. It creates too much chaos in the organization, and it’s not good change management. Product demos shouldn’t change right when sales is trying to close the quarter. By the same token, when lightning strikes occur in the middle of the quarter, the positive press coverage helps to drive leads and advance deals.
Snapping the calendars together with an offset creates a single operating cadence for the company. Here’s how to do it:
This simple system will create a superstructure for everything happening inside of the company. Each month of the quarter takes on its own character and theme. For example:
Month One is going to be dominated by planning. It starts with Sales Kickoff. The Sales Ops team distributes new sales plans, territories, and quotas. The PMs also present at SKO. Meanwhile, the finance team closes out the books on the previous quarter. The exec team works on Board meeting prep. The Board meeting happens towards the middle or end of the month. The strategic insights discussed at that Board meeting are immediately fed back into the company. The product roadmap is reviewed and reprioritized for the following quarter’s release.
Month Two is dominated by preparations for the big launch event that will happen in week six or seven. Keynotes are written. Marketing collateral is finalized. QA and testing begin on the release, and some features are already in closed beta with customers. Meanwhile, the product managers, when not testing, are racing ahead to get ready for next quarter. After the event, you debrief as a company. How did the launch go? What did customers say? Those learnings are internalized. This is also a good time to recognize employees for the great work that made the launch possible.
Month Three is a heads-down period. The sales reps are focused on closing deals and hitting quota. Hopefully the launch event generated positive news that they can use to put deals over the top. Meanwhile, the engineers are focused on coding the next release. Remember that in month two, the PMs finalized planning for this release while engineers were bug fixing. This is a time for minimal distractions, as the team cranks out code and closes deals. Once the quarter ends, the cycle begins anew, with the next SKO, quarterly close, and Board meeting.
Knowing the big milestones inside the quarter makes it easier to plan all-hands meetings. For example:
Each major event creates the opportunity for an all-hands meeting to keep everybody up to date and synchronized.
The Cadence puts the four key functions in a SaaS company (Sales, Finance, Product, Marketing) on a quarterly calendar. Human beings are wired for seasons so this is a natural way to work. The Sales-Finance System is oriented around a quarterly close as its central event, while the Product-Marketing System orients around a launch event. Synchronizing these calendars creates a single operating cadence for the company.
The compounding effect of operating on a cadence is huge. You will ship four great quarters per year. Most big companies are lucky if they have even one. If you run the Cadence quarter after quarter, year after year, your SaaS company will graduate from a chaotic startup into an unbeatable army.

To facilitate some training, I wrote up this quick cheat sheet of terms used in service ecosystems (where B2B SaaS products play). I have a PDF of this here . Feel free to share, but please keep the attribution (to me) on the doc. That way I’ll be liable for the spelling mistakes, not you.
Note: I wish I had time to make a fancy infographic or animated movie thing. Maybe later.
CAPABILITIES allow human ACTORS to achieve OUTCOMES (that produce BENEFITS). Actors frequently have relationships with other actors. Outcomes and benefits are sometimes referred to as GOALS, which importantly can have functional, motivational, emotional, and social dimensions. VALUE can be stated as a ratio of benefits to cost.
To achieve outcomes, actors access TOUCHPOINTS, and interact with INTERFACES within those touchpoints. Repeated INTERACTIONS are often known as WORKFLOWS. Workflows can span multiple touchpoints/interfaces. Touchpoints are sometimes referred to as CHANNELS.
Typically — in business software — actors actively (or passively) create, read, update, and delete ENTITIES. Think of entities — users, work orders, pageviews, companies — as nouns (and interactions as verbs). Entities contain CONTENT and INFORMATION. Importantly, entities may mean different things in different CONTEXTS (a specific actor, desired benefit, touchpoint, etc.) and have ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS. BUSINESS LOGIC prescribes how entities interact with one another.
All SERVICE DELIVERY efforts can be mapped to actors and their desired benefits. Elements of service delivery can be visible to users (e.g. interface, customer service) or invisible (e.g. backend technology, monitoring, HR).
Some SKILLS (also capabilities) are applicable narrowly to specific actors, interfaces. etc. Other skills — like accessibility, HR, performance, fraud prevention — span actors, desired outcomes, and interfaces. To reiterate … everything contributes to delivering value to customer actors, but some things happen to be closer to the customer. The Coffee Maker maps to customer value. Stop doing stuff that doesn’t!
PROJECTS are temporary endeavors to optimize and/or expand the CAPABILITY OFFERING. FEATURES are temporary solutions to offering specific capabilities. The service delivery mechanism often changes with time. Actors may base buying decisions on advertised features, but in SaaS the long term value of the offering is contingent on the ability to continuously generate outcomes and benefits (also known as BENEFIT REALIZATION). Unlike wrapped software products, SaaS PRODUCTS — given their mutable nature — function more like capability offering packages. SaaS is predominantly a SERVICE ECOSYSTEM.
By producing VALUE for Actors, and through effective PACKAGING and ENABLEMENT (delivered by internal actors and capabilities) an organization ostensibly makes MONEY (a BUSINESS OUTCOME).

In May 2015 I quit my job as a software engineer at Facebook to start a company. Canny is going pretty well, but if I could go back, I’d definitely do things differently.
I can’t go back. But I can share what I’ve learned to help you avoid making the same mistakes. 😊
With statistics like 92% of startups fail within 3 years, you have to be pretty darn confident to start one. As a result founders tend to have huge egos. This makes it easy to believe you’re special, and that your ideas are special, when they aren’t.
I’ll admit it, I used to think this way — that entrepreneurship meant coming up with a brilliant, unique idea and building it. This couldn’t be farther from the truth.
Your idea doesn’t matter. What matters is what the market needs: What problem will real people/companies pay you to solve? How will your solution be better than what’s already out there?
Answering these questions forms the foundation of your business.
How do you answer them? Definitely not by sitting in your apartment dreaming up ideas. You answer them by talking to people. Not friends. Not family. Talk to people you’d like to sell to.
Don’t go into these meetings trying to validate your idea. Instead, try to reveal pain points. Once you’ve heard 10 different people describe the same burning pain point, you know you’re on to something.
This alone will get you farther than so many companies because you’re guaranteed to build something people need.
Understanding the pain points of your customers is a big part of “customer development”. I put this phrase in quotes because I had no idea what it meant until a year after becoming a founder. I probably should have read The Lean Startup. You probably should too!
Customer development is a lot more than just a way to generate great ideas. It’ll come in handy at every step of the way. It turns hard, open-ended questions into easy ones:
Validating ideas is just the beginning. Customer development is the foundation of your entire sales and marketing strategy. Without it you’re just guessing.
Engineers love to hate on sales. It makes sense — most of us are introverts, driven by building outstanding products/infrastructure.
I actually think engineers just hate the idea of sales, but for the most part haven’t tried it. I was certainly in this boat before starting a SaaS startup.
While we’re stereotyping, most engineers I know love games and strategy. It goes nicely with being good at logic. To me, sales is just another strategy game. You win when you close the deal.
Let’s say you want to sell your product to a company for $1,000/mo.
Here’s how you “win”:
Now, doesn’t that sound fun? Okay, maybe I exaggerated a bit. Still, there’s a ton of strategy in successfully getting and running those meetings.
If you’re just starting out, I’d urge you to make your first dollar as soon as possible. Once somebody you don’t know pays you for what you’ve built, you know it’s worth something. And it feels great! You’re officially adding value to others, and you’re getting paid for it.
I never appreciated the value of my network until I started a company. Having a great network makes pretty much everything easier. It’s like steroids for your startup.
Here are just a few ways your network can help you crush it:
And the list doesn’t end there. This is why you should go out of your way to build relationships with everyone you can.
Especially if you’re an intern or still in college — you’re amongst a group of highly talented peers who are just starting their career. Someday these people will grow to be great engineers, decision makers, managers, founders, etc.
This advice goes for full timers too. Several of my peers at Facebook have since left to start great, inspiring companies. They’ve been generous enough to be early users of my product, introduce me to leads and investors, and offer their valuable time and advice.
When you’re a software engineer, your job is to build stuff. That’s why, after you leave to start a company, it’s easy to fall into the default mindset of “What should we build next?”.
This mindset is going to slow you down. You’re no longer just responsible for the product — now the entire business. As a founder there’s an endless number of things you could be doing. Writing code is only one of them, and not always the right one.
Building the product will be by far the easiest and most fun thing you do. One of the biggest challenges will be getting people to use what you’ve built. This problem is very rarely solved by building more features.
Pick your North Star Metric, a single metric that represents how much value you’re delivering to your users. Instead of asking “What should we build next?”, ask “How can we drive our north star metric?”.
It seems like the default mentality in Silicon Valley is “I’m starting a company, so I need to go raise half a million dollars.” This just isn’t true.
Raising a round typically takes 3–6 months. That’s right, months. In that time, you could do customer development, find a great problem to solve, build an MVP, launch it, and get paying customers. Or, you could raise $500k. Which sounds more impactful?
By bootstrapping, you’ll learn how to grow while keeping costs aggressively low. This is great for building a capital efficient company from the start. Ironically, this will help you raise at more favorable terms later on. Not to mention you’ll own more of your company.
Of course, you can raise. It could put you in a future position where you’re able to grow much faster. Just know that you don’t have to.
VCs want you to go big or die. Going big typically starts around $100m of annual revenue. As a founder, there are lots of good states between dead and $100m per year.
I love the breadth of experience you get as a founder — sales, marketing, fundraising, recruiting, and much more. What are you waiting for? Go meet with some potential customers!

An unconventionally epic bootstrapped startup year in review.
For most of us, 2017 was a year better left in the dumpster fire from which it was born (aka, “ 2016”).
For me, 2017 was something truly remarkable and special that I’ll soon not forget — just like how I’d imagine contracting a mild case of necrotizing fasciitis might be.
If “growth is painful”, then 2017 left me feeling a bit like a bootstrapped startup remake of House.
Between running a growing portfolio of bootstrapped startups (including Tamboo, an all-in-one session recording and replay tool), writing a book about bootstrapping startups (while still adding to my growing Medium epic, which has now been read by over 180,000 people!!!), building a Slack community for bootstrappers, entertaining all the awesome people following me on Twitter (and adding over 500 new followers organically), getting ready to launch a new podcast, starting an open source SaaS-in-a-box, training for an upcoming 100 mile ultramarathon, reading 38 non-business books totaling 19,627 pages, and answering over 766 emails from fellow bootstrappers the world over (all while still having “a life”), you might be thinking that I “crushed it” in 2017.
Put that way, yeah, I guess I kicked some serious ass.
But in the process, I also got my ass seriously kicked.
But maybe I’m getting ahead of myself here. Maybe we should rewind things a bit and start at the beginning…
December, 2016
It all started on December 19th, 2016, a day that will go down in infamy.
That was the day that I inadvertently broke the internet and set off this whole sick cycle carousel I’ve been riding ever since.
On that day, the stars, constellations, git branches, and quantum bits all somehow aligned (in what I can only describe as some kind of weird prank I’m still convinced the universe is playing on me) and plucked me from my comfy and cozy “lurking in the shadows” bootstrapped existence and unceremoniously plopped me down on the Mount of Startup Olympus (otherwise known as “Hacker News”).
Now, for most people, getting to the top of Hacker News (and all of the accompanying attention that ensues) is a wet startup dream come true.
(And I’m not going to lie— that whole experience definitely creamed my Twinkie a little.)
But truth be told, it’s been both one of the best things and one of the worst things that’s ever happened to me.
Before we dig into that though, I think it helps to share a little bit about what 2016 was like for me up until that point, which is something I haven’t shared with anyone to date (see, you’re special!)
Simply put, 2016 was rough — both personally and professionally for me.
I had a handful of projects flame out pretty much simultaneously, including one that was my oldest source of revenue, as well as another that was my (at the time) largest source of revenue.
I threw everything I could at them to try to bring them back from the startup graveyard, but try as I might to rescue and resuscitate them, I just couldn’t make their shit beep like it used to.
Admitting that they were “done” and that it was most likely time to kill them off was one of the hardest things I had to come to grips with.
That, and realizing that all of this represented a 45% hit to my income.
I’ll admit — I was not the funnest person to be around at that point in time.
In fact, I pretty much just shut down.
I couldn’t really deal with much of anything.
Just trying to figure out what to eat for dinner would send me into an hour-long cycle of analysis paralysis (I kid you not).
To offset all of this lovely stress, I started running my ass off even more than I normally did. That is, of course, until I broke three of my toes and wound up with a crippling instance of achilles tendinitis that put me out of commission for months.
After taking some (well deserved?) time to hit rock bottom and feel sorry for myself, I decided to pick myself back up and stare into the abyss looming back at me.
If I gave up, I knew that I could never forgive myself.
And I knew that if I didn’t stare down this existential beast staring back at me, that it would tear me apart limb from limb.
So I dug in and got myself right again.
I couldn’t run, so I started meditating regularly (which was brutal at first). I stopped listening to post-hardcore music (quite arguably my drug of choice) and switched full over to tropical house. I started reading fiction and literature at night (sometimes going well into the morning). I started eating lighter (and cheaper). I forced myself to be brutally honest about my feelings — and sought to destroy them before they could destroy me.
And most of all, I forced myself to go “back to basics”.
After I had calmed myself down, I realized that I had probably prematurely torched a couple of the projects that I had taken behind the woodshed and that some of them could have probably been saved.
Of course, it was a little bit late for that now.
So rather than cry over spilled milk (or slain startups), I forced myself to shore up what I had left and to grow out what I could.
Once I had gotten myself back on solid ground, I had a renewed sense of clarity from the whole experience.
It was from this “back to basics renaissance” that I penned the first part of The Epic Guide in order to start the fulfillment of a vow that I had made to myself.
Two months later, it took off. And the rest is history.
That was 2016.
Enter 2017.
January
So I ended 2016 on a high note that appeared to be the harbinger of awesome for what 2017 would bring — or so I thought.
Looking back, January was actually rather foreboding in a way — I just completely missed the signal from the noise.
Much of January was spent trying to dig myself out of the fall out from having gone interstellar in December.
My inbox was flooded with emails.
I had more Tamboo signups in trial than I could keep up with.
And of course, this crazy idea for turning The Epic Guide into a full-length book was getting traction and picking up steam.
I remember January as “inbox month”.
Whether it was responding to people writing me about the articles, going back and forth with people interested in the book, or sending gazillions of emails to all of the people who were trialing Tamboo to see how I could help them, if I could get feedback from them, or if they were at all ready to convert to a paid plan, I just remember lots and lots (and lots)… of emails.
January ultimately ended on a disappointing note: Despite the massive influx of new trials, and despite all of the emails that I sent, people just weren’t converting like they should have. Part of me knew this would happen. I knew that these were just “tire kickers” checking out Tamboo from the Medium articles and that they were never serious about paying — they were just curious and wanted to play. And since it was free to try out and play with, they did just that. (Much to my chagrin.)
But that still didn’t stop me from hoping that that wasn’t the case and it most certainly didn’t stop me from trying to turn those trials into paying customers. In my exuberance, I even broke the cardinal rule of product management and added features requested by customers who said “It needs to do this before I’m willing to pay”. And of course, despite spending weeks building those features out, none of them converted or paid once they were in place.
February
I wish I could say that I stopped foolishly chasing the influx of new trial users in February that I secretly knew where just bad for business, but then I wouldn’t be sitting here kicking my own ass for your amusement, now would I?
Instead, I spent a ridiculous amount of time fucking with Tamboo’s UI and UX to see if that would somehow convince them to stay.
Fucking amateur hour, right?
(Stay tuned kids, it gets better.)
It’s about this time that demand for The Epic Guide: The Book reached critical mass. I had to make a decision — it was time to shit or get off the pot with this book “idea” I had.
Part of me really, really, really didn’t want to do this book.
Part of me knew that this would probably turn into a “bad idea” that I would regret.
Part of me was like “Are you nuts?! This is going to be a huge time sink and distraction!”
And yet there was that nagging voice in the back of my head that said “If you don’t take this opportunity you’ve been given and run with it, you’re going to regret it.”
I hemmed and hawed about it for weeks on end.
Eventually, I literally flipped a coin to decide if I was going to do it or not (I kid you not).
Fucking heads.
So I spent the better part of the end of February coming up with copy and building out the presale site for the book, hooking up payment processing, and getting Part 4 of The Epic Guide ready for launch, where I would announce the launch of the presale.
And of course, the damned thing had to take off.
March
March was kind of all over the board.
I did a lot of work on Tamboo, from adding features to updating the marketing site to tweaking the backend. I think this was around the time that I did the first major rewrite or update of the heatmap engine, as well (more on that fun later).
In addition to the book presales continuing to pile up, March is also when Courtland and I recorded my Indie Hackers podcast episode.
I don’t know if you can tell or not from listening to it, but I was super the fuck freaked out.
The IH podcast was newer at the time (I was episode #9), but I knew it still had massive reach even then — and that that reach was growing every day.
I had never done a podcast episode or even a recorded interview for that matter before — and here I was doing my first podcast interview ever on Indie Hackers?!
March was also when I started Bootslacking, an invite-only Slack group for people running or starting bootstrapped startups. This was mainly born out of a frustration of not having any good place to “talk shop” with other bootstrappers, and since I was getting emails from so many of them, I thought it made sense to bring them together in a forum where the focus could be on sharing and learning knowledge and experiences about startups and business — and where anyone who turned out to be a random fly-by-night startup promoter would be immediately booted.
Meanwhile, The Epic Guide continued to grow and and spread its tendrils across the internet, creating an obscene number of “tire kicker” free trials that I (of course!) was still running around trying to turn into magical unicorn poop conversions.
April
I remember April vividly, despite the complete lack of sleep.
April is when things really started to heat up.
It all began with the build-out of a “live demo” for Tamboo.
The idea for the live demo was simple enough: It would let people try out Tamboo on their own website in a quick interactive demo that wouldn’t require them to install anything so that they could see how it would work. Basically, they’d enter their website URL, I’d show them their website in an iframe, I’d record what they did, and then I’d let them watch a recording of that session.
On my end, this would hopefully:
Simple enough, right?
From a technical perspective, building out the demo was much more difficult than I had anticipated. It turns out browsers don’t really like it when you try to inject JavaScript into an iframe whose source URL isn’t one that you own (who’d of thought, right? 😐).
So I basically had to build a proxy that would retrieve the website requested and serve up the content from my own domain that I could then inject the Tamboo agent into to do its capture and recording magic. But even that wasn’t as straight-forward as you’d think, given all the websites using CORS to block requests to things like stylesheets, etc. And not to mention all the rewrite rules that you had to apply to things like stylesheets, image URLs, links, etc., etc., etc. to make it all work.
It took me about two weeks of (literally) around the clock hacking to get something that I thought would work together.
Once it was live, people started using it en masse.
And that’s when I realized just how far I was from “getting it right”.
There were so many random ass edge cases that pretty much every site that tried it out wound up having massive rendering and recording issues.
In short, I spent a lot of time sending emails to people to apologize for the shitty demo experience they had while trying to salvage what I could. And all that time, I was madly plugging away around the clock fixes for things that I saw people running into.
Oh, and did I mention that all those beautiful leads and data that I thought I would get were basically total trash?
Yeah.
It turns out a lot of people just liked to stick sites like cnn.com and whatnot in there to see what would happen (plus there were more than a few cheeky bastards who loved to put URLs in to my competitor’s websites…)
And the sites that did use their actual website address?
Most of them were things like doggy boutiques, hair salons, psychologists, a Hungarian foodie site, florists, and a bunch of (obviously) very early stage “startups”, just to name a few.
There was absolutely no rhyme or reason to any of it. None of them demonstrated any kind of target market pattern like I was hoping to uncover. There was pretty much nothing actionable that could be gained.
And to make things even more fun and interesting? The people who did sign up to view their recordings from the demo hardly ever converted to an actual trial. It was one and done, in and out.
Also in April (oh, we’re not done yet here), I started to hit some massive performance issues and had to completely refactor my backend.
This was something that was slowly growing and coming to a head, but was put over the top by a super large website coming on that singlehandedly threw more traffic at me than I have literally ever seen in my life before.
So with all of this live demo fun going on, I was simultaneously doing everything I could just to keep the lights on while getting buried from more traffic than a Hacker News tsunami — on an hourly basis.
I eventually split out the new customer onto their own dedicated set of servers just to get their load off of everyone else (who were starting to complain about performance) and used the experience to completely revamp the backend.
That refactoring effort required me to do a massive data migration effort that I spent days planning and testing for in my staging environment to make sure it would go off without a hitch.
And of course, nothing went off without a hitch when I ran it in production.
In fact, there were hitches lying all over the floor of my office, broken and shattered as I frantically tried to make things work. Everything was locking up, freezing up, timing out, and taking way more time than my test runs would have indicated.
I thought I had done everything right to avoid this — I had even used a complete copy of my production data to run my tests against.
So what the fuck happened?
Production load.
The live load on the system wasn’t something I had accounted for and basically caused everything to violently thrash in an endless cycle of pain.
After three sleepless nights, I finally was able to pull the system out of its downward death spiral and get the migration to complete.
Three fucking days.
It took six hours in staging.
Oh, and then a few weeks later that massive new customer that I was really excited to have on board that kind of pushed everything to the tipping point of catching on fire and burying me in startup ashes unceremoniously cancelled without reason and went dark. This is of course after having had numerous back and forth emails and phone calls with them to get them properly onboarded, and after they had gleefully declared that everything was working “great” and that it was “awesome” and that the PO was being cut.
As if that weren’t enough, I also wrote the first 100 pages or so of The Epic Guide Book in April, as well as started a major refactoring of Tamboo’s UI and UX, codenamed “Project Cayman”.
May
May saw the release of Project Cayman, (another) complete refactoring of Tamboo’s heatmap engine, and support for capturing and recording YouTube video interactions (yet another one of those customer requests I probably should have just passed on in hindsight).
I also completely updated the marketing site as well as modified the pricing structure to capture what I thought would have been a good opportunity to align pricing to how people were using Tamboo (which ultimately became yet another failed experiment).
At the time, there was no limit to how many websites you could use Tamboo on under a single account. I saw that a number of people were using Tamboo on multiple websites and thought “Huh! Maybe I should tier the pricing based on how many websites they want to use it on!” I had always hated the usage-based pricing of how many recordings people could have. Most people just don’t know how much traffic they get, or how many recordings they might need. I had done things to try and make this easier on the end user, such as leaving limits open during trials and then recommending a tier based on their trial usage, but I still felt that these “limits” were maybe preventing people from signing up for a trial. So in my mind, this was the best of both worlds — you know how many websites you have or want to use this with, and you don’t need to worry so much about limits then. Brilliant, right?
Yeah, not so much. (But it took over a month to figure that out.)
But honestly, what I remember most from May is how Project Cayman and its roll out just ruthlessly kicked my ass. All of this was a continued attempt to convert all of this “startup gold” traffic coming my way. I was getting people coming through, signing up, trialing, using it daily, and then never converting when it was time to pay (despite numerous outreach emails, many of which received favorable replies like “I love it!”, but then they’d go dark when it was time to pay). And so I continued to think that I had to fix something with the UI and UX to make it even more awesome to get all these people to convert. The conversion rates just weren’t where they should be, despite the large influx of trial users.
So I worked around the clock to “improve” the UI and UX to try and “make it work”. After all, the (small) number of people who responded to my emails about why they cancelled out of their trials all said stuff about the UI and the UX, so that must be what needed “fixed”, right?
Oh! And of course, live demos were still going at this time, causing me endless frustration and grief and somehow bringing even more tire kickers in through the gates. (More on that in a bit.)
June
At the start of June, I kind of lost my shit.
I think it helps to understand a few things in order to really understand why.
When I had originally written the first part of The Epic Guide, it was just a Medium article that I had written. It didn’t have any reference to Tamboo or anything else. It was just me writing as me.
A number of people were like “What’s your startup?! I want to check it out!”
I thought that was pretty cool and a completely valid request, but at the same time, I was like “which one”?
I had a number of “startups”, and I really didn’t want any undo attention on some of them that I thought could introduce some otherwise unnecessary competition in their space.
So I picked one of my newer ones that I thought was complicated enough that it would turn people off from trying to copy it and that I thought could benefit from some free eyeballs 🙃
Up until that point, I was slowly but steadily growing Tamboo with very specific market segments that worked well with it being a younger platform that still a lot of work ahead of it.
Tamboo was my first attempt at “leveling up” from more niche applications. It was an intentionally more ambitious, more mass market play. It was my “10x” endeavor. And it looked like it had the potential to do just that based on early engagement, feedback, and results.
Now, keep in mind, this is all before the Hacker News tsunami.
People who initially read the articles (again, before the HN kraken) checked out Tamboo (now that there was a “plug” for it), seemed to like it, signed up for it, and even became customers.
And I was like “Wow, this is pretty cool. Non-heavy handed content marketing about a topic that I’m completely passionate about for the win!”
And then the Hacker News tsunami hit (and spread) and all of that went to shit.
Sure, I started getting way more trials, but the conversions were total shit.
Because those people weren’t really my target market.
But there were just so many of them that I just couldn’t keep myself from trying to capture some of that “market”.
Now, the other thing to keep in mind is that prior to The Epic Guide gaining notoriety, I was pretty much a “shadow lurker”. Aside from playing around with answering startup questions on Quora at one point, I really hadn’t ever “put myself out there”.
In fact, I never wanted to be “out there”.
Some people want attention, recognition, notoriety, fame, and so on.
Me? I just want to make money running a business that I own. No muss, no fuss. I don’t care who knows who I am or what I do. I’m perfectly happy making bank and living my life without all of the accolades or vanity that come with running a “startup”.
Okay, so where was I?
Oh yes, the losing my shit part.
Basically, I had spent the last six months chasing some sort of elusive “growth ghost” with Tamboo by trying to turn this “marketing channel” that startup notoriety had given me into something usable, and it just wasn’t working the way that I thought it should.
Combine that with the fact that I was experiencing high churn (about a 3 month average LTV) from these efforts with an app that I had planned on being low churn.
Part of the allure of Tamboo to me was that I felt that it would be something that people would buy and keep for a long time as a way to learn from changes they made to their website, as well as a kind of “insurance policy” they could use to troubleshoot issues that might creep up. I imagined it would be something more like an analytics program that people would use maybe a few times a month but would continue to keep around indefinitely because they couldn’t “go back” to running a business without the kind of visibility that it gave them.
So that was one part of the equation.
The other part was that at this same time, my profile as an “expert” in the bootstrapping space continued to grow.
The fact that my name became synonymous with Tamboo started to wear on me.
Here was this thing that I had started to grow in a very strategic way that all of a sudden is getting all of this attention, but none of that traffic or attention are “converting” properly.
And that was fucking with me.
Now, it wasn’t that Tamboo wasn’t growing or that it wasn’t “working”. It was just that it wasn’t growing or working the way that I thought it should now that it had all of this “free marketing” getting thrown at it.
And while all this is going on, preorders for the book keep pouring in, my followers keep growing, and more and more people keep discovering The Epic Guide and for some reason or another prop me up as some kind of a startup hero to be revered and looked up to.
This internal dichotomy started to mess with me.
Here I was, trying to figure out how to get this thing to convert all of this newfound traffic and attention into something meaningful, while at the same time everyone thinks that I’m some sort of magical startup hero who has all the answers.
But I’m not a hero.
I’m just a dude.
I do not have nor have I ever been imbued with any kind of startup superpowers.
But that didn’t seem to stop people from thinking otherwise.
My articles continued to get more and more popular. My inbox got more and more emails. And I continued to get more and more preorders for the book.
It’s around this point in time that I started to feel like I can’t fuck up for fear of some kind of a fallout.
The fucked up “growth” that Tamboo was experiencing and the fucked up live demo and free trial fiascos that were causing me to want to rip my hair out couldn’t ever be discussed because… what would people think?
So the pressure got to me a bit and I kind of lost it.
I was spending an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out how to get my conversion and retention numbers from these people to work and I wasn’t getting much of anything else done.
Plus, I felt that maybe free trials, as standard as they are for other SaaS apps, might not be the way to go with Tamboo. You see, free trials mostly exist to 1) get people in the door and 2) give people time to get setup in a new app and to achieve some goal/get some outcome before being required to pay as a way to reduce early friction (and get them hooked).
With Tamboo, people got value out of the gate. And I had a sneaking suspicion that people were using the trial, getting that upfront value, and then just going their merry way.
So I killed the live demo and ripped out free trials and forced everyone to “pay to play” —aka credit card and payment up front.
That was probably a little hasty, but it felt so fucking good.
The minute those changes went live, my inbox got quiet. Real quiet.
I wasn’t getting notifications about new “leads” I had to track down. I wasn’t getting error reports about shit breaking in a demo or getting support requests from people in a free trial complaining about something not working right (or at least not how they expected).
If you wanted my attention, you’d at least be a paying customer.
It was bliss.
It was at that time that I decided to switch gears and put some focus into this book, which was continuing to get steam and traction and weighing on me more and more each day.
I spent most of the rest of June focused on the book now that I could stop worrying about demos and trials and tire kickers.
July
Instead of stressing about Tamboo in July, I shifted most of my focus to the book (which I in turn wound up stressing about).
Writing the first pass of the first part of the book took much longer and required much more effort than I had anticipated.
It took me a little while to “find my groove”. Writing a book is very different from writing a bunch of blog posts. (Anyone who’s made an attempt at one will know what I’m talking about.)
I wound up writing something like 300 pages in a marathon multi-week writing session.
Then I threw it all away and started over from scratch.
The second round, I wrote something like 200 pages and wound up throwing 75 pages or so to the cutting room floor, leaving me with about 125 pages give or take.
Editing took far more time than I would have ever imagined.
I think that I went through three or four editing passes on the first part before I finally thought it was at a point where I felt comfortable releasing it.
I was a little nervous releasing such a monster (it was the first release, clocking in at over 100 pages), but at the same time I had reviewed and edited it enough that I was pretty confident in what I had put together.
Still, hitting “send” on that email list was honestly a little scary.
But it turns out people loved it and I got a lot of positive feedback and encouragement.
August
I really enjoyed working on writing the first part of the book. I had dreaded the effort that would be involved, but once I got into it, I really thoroughly enjoyed it. Shipping it felt even more awesome (I love shipping — there is no feeling quite like it).
But that whole time, I was stressing about Tamboo and all the things I wasn’t doing there.
Ever since I had killed off the live demo and the free trials, signups had plunged.
This was to be expected, but I knew that in order to maximize those pay-up-front conversions, that I would need to do a better job of showcasing and explaining Tamboo on the marketing site.
Up until then, I could afford to have less on the marketing site because the free trial kind of offset any kind of risk for people to try it out.
Not having any kind of trial anymore, I needed to really up the potency of my marketing site to convince people to fork over their credit card for something they couldn’t try out first.
So I did just that and completely overhauled the marketing site and pricing structure (again).
Like I had mentioned before, I thought that offering pricing around the number of websites that someone would want to use Tamboo on would be a logical way to segment tiers, but it just didn’t seem to be resonating the way that I thought it would. So I switched back to usage-based pricing, but I structured the plans around customer segments to make it scream “this is for me” to them. So I now had plans for “Personal”, “Startup”, “Business”, and “Agency” to target those different classes of users, which would hopefully help overcome any kind of confusion about recording limits.
I also did some much needed marketing and promotion for Tamboo, but in hindsight, I was doing it in the wrong places again (more on that later).
At the end of August, I decided to bite the bullet and start the process of launching a podcast, which is something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time (sort of like writing the book). To gauge intereset, I created a landing page for SaaS In Gear and started promoting it, following my tried and tested method with the goal of getting 100 signups.
September
Then September hit, and I had a serious meltdown.
Shit was starting to wear on me.
Bad.
It’s around this time that I started to feel like the market for Tamboo had somehow moved under me, and that I had missed a huge opportunity by having my focus and attention diverted by this whole “startup culture” thing I had somehow found myself wrapped up in.
Somehow, all of the effort that I had exerted to date caught up with me in one massive tidal wave of despair.
All of the late nights, all of the weekends, all of the emails, all of the seemingly endless refactoring and tweaking, all of the marketing site updates, all of the never ending support requests, all of the writing, all of the forums, all of the Slack groups, all of the shitty conversion rates, all of the atrocious retention numbers, all of the, all of the, all of the… everything.
It just hit me.
Very much like a ton of bricks.
I shut down.
I became despondent.
I started to feel like I had back in 2016 when everything fell out from under me.
Sure, this was very different from then. After all, my revenue was going up instead of down, and I was still moving in the “right” direction — just not in the way that I wanted to, and not in the way that I thought that I should.
But I still had this feeling that what I was doing wasn’t somehow right.
That I was screwing something up by not being as focused as I should on the things that I knew I should and that in the process, I was missing out on something much bigger.
And that I somehow might have “missed the boat” by the time I realized it.
It was at this time that I started to “feel” that things had somehow changed over the past few months.
I’d completely cut off trials, so I knew things would be much slower and less action-packed, but I felt that there was something else going on — something that was out of my control.
I didn’t have anything to support my suspicions, but I started to feel that session replay tools had become commoditized by my competitors — and that they had somehow turned this whole market into a race to the bottom.
This suspicion came from the observation that pretty much every one of my competitors were now engaged in a freemium play — offering completely free tiers for their products. And seeing a lot of people starting to tout that as a “benefit” — “You can use it for free!”
As a bootstrapper, you don’t want to get into a freemium fight if you can avoid it.
Freemium — especially in a resource intense business like session recordings — can be very expensive.
Based on what I knew, I’d come to the conclusion that the largest of my competitors had used their freemium play as a way to basically corner the market and juice their SEO.
In the process, they were forcing everyone else in the market to follow suite if they wanted to stay in the game.
The vast majority of their “customers” don’t pay for their service, but since they had a nice little war chest to burn, and since it helped them maintain their market dominance, they seemed to be fine with that. They were still making bank from the other side of the freemium play, and so it seemed to be working out masterfully for them.
They were able to keep low-cost competitors from “stealing away” at the lower end of their customer base by offering a free tier, and they were able to maintain their higher price point by being “number one”.
I didn’t know if this was a game that I wanted to play anymore.
I was beat down and worn out and I just didn’t know if I had it in me to fight this fight anymore.
I gave myself permission to crash.
And so I did.
A few days later, I picked myself back up.
I knew that feeling sorry for myself wasn’t going to fix anything.
The only thing that would fix anything would be to get back up and face these things head on.
So that’s what I did.
I wrote down all of the shit that was getting to me.
And then I asked myself what I could do about each of the things I had written down.
If I couldn’t do anything about it, I told myself to suck it up and crossed it off the list.
If I could do something about it, I forced myself to figure out what I could do — even if it wasn’t a guaranteed “fix”. (Any action is better than no action.)
This exercise helped, but it didn’t take the emotional drain I was feeling away. It just gave me a course of action.
And so I went to work.
I continued to promote the podcast launch list.
I tackled some nasty support issues for some new customers that took a lot of time and effort.
I worked on Part 2 of The Epic Guide Book.
I made some performance and stability improvements.
I tweaked some UI and UX things.
I started working on adding a custom funnel feature to Tamboo.
All in all, I came back swinging in September, even though I still felt like shit the whole time.
It was around this time that I started feeling like I just wanted to shut down and do me and not worry about anyone else. So I pulled back on Twitter, email, Slack, forums, etc. This was the start of me going “inside” and just wanting to insulate myself from everything.
October
In October, I finished and rolled out the custom funnel feature for Tamboo, as well as completely gutted the heatmap engine again (this is the third time if you lost track) and added support for mouse movement heatmaps.
And of course, it’s pretty much useless to add new features and not tell anyone about them, so I made some marketing site updates and did some promoting to showcase the new funnels and heatmaps.
I even gave one more last-ditch effort to try to convert some of my Medium traffic by creating a special offer to get a copy of my book when people from Medium signed up for Tamboo (I still couldn’t let that go for some reason).
I spent (a lot) of time finishing up the second part of The Epic Guide Book, including spending what I would consider an obscene amount of time working on illustrations for it. Shipping the second part and getting some of that built-up pressure off my plate felt good, kind of like coming home and just crashing on your couch after a long day at work.
And if all of that wasn’t enough, I also wrote and published Part 5 of The Epic Guide Medium series, which was (embarrassingly) the first update to the series in months.
I was worn down, and not feeling very social, but I was at least still moving.
November
All of that caught up with me in November.
I still did stuff, but it was getting harder and harder to get back up.
I got swamped pretty early on with some more intense support issues from new customers (this shit is hard, if you haven’t caught on yet).
I spent about a week fucking with heatmaps again (fourth rewrite in the year).
I marketed.
I started Tamboo Academy.
I started a prototype of a website chat feature.
I ran (keep in mind, I’m still training for an ultramarathon during all of this).
And I finally caved and brought back trials.
Signups were too low for my taste with the “pay up front” approach, so I compromised and decided to do credit card upfront trials (which have worked out better).
The whole time, I just felt down and didn’t really want to talk to anyone about anything.
I was really starting to feel this whole “split brain” life I was living.
On one hand, I have this great application that I spent a shit ton of time on that I feel has a lot of potential, but that I don’t feel I’m focusing on in the right way, and that could have more outsized results if I’d just go all-in on it. It isn’t easy to work with (there are days I absolutely hate working on this thing), and it seems to be getting harder to market it. There are things that I would love to do with it, but I just can’t bring myself to do those things unless I can get my conversion and retention rates where I want them to be. I’ve been half tempted to just put the thing on autopilot, be happy with the income it generates, and shift my focus to something else. It‘s not something that I necessarily enjoy anymore. There are times when I feel like I just can’t turn it into what I had originally wanted it to be anymore, and that I just haven’t been properly focused on putting my efforts towards the right markets for it.
On the other hand, I’ve built up this “startup personality” thing somehow, and I really enjoy writing and helping people get and see traction with their projects. (At least when I’m not emotionally burned out by everything.) I get honest enjoyment from helping people go from “I’m stuck and frustrated” to “I’m making $1,000 MRR!”. I feel honest pride and admiration for them, and it makes me feel like I have a purpose bigger than just eeking out another tenth of a conversion rate percent on my website.
But I was starting to see that the two are incompatible and are actually at odds with each other.
Like I’ve mentioned before, Tamboo had (and continues to get) a lot of attention from my Medium articles and all of the sites that link back to it because of my “startup status”.
But hardly any of that has resulted in any kind of actual, tangible business results for Tamboo.
The vast majority of the people who have paid for Tamboo did not come from any of those efforts or traffic.
By my calculations, roughly 3% of all paying Tamboo customers can be directly attributed to those sources.
(Surprised?)
And yet I’ve wound up spending a shit ton of my time contributing to that community since last year.
(And sure, I’m not going to lie — I’ve tried converting some of that traffic and attention, but it just doesn’t seem to want to be converted.)
But doing both when neither benefits the other, and when they both push and pull at me in very different ways that leave me exhausted, feeling like I’m failing at my goals for either, and make me feel like working on one over the other is causing me to choose which one I want to see fall behind even more?
I just don’t know.
December
By December, I’m feeling overwhelmed and ready to just curl into a ball and wait it out until January.
It started off okay enough.
I did some more marketing. I did some more customer onboarding.
But things kind of fell off the rails early on.
Maybe it was the fallout that hit the session replay market from a widely publicized “study” that got covered in near every major tech publication. (A lot of us saw a major drop in subscribers as a result of that. I even had a few people start leaving me “love notes” on Tamboo’s website. Definitely “motivating” stuff.)
Or maybe it was the one customer that I had spent a few days helping to get onboarded (due to some issues with the way they had coded their website) that decided to just cancel on me that sort of pushed me over the edge.
Any one of these might have been the straw that broke the camel’s back, but it was a long time coming.
Despite all of the effort I put into my training this year, logging a shit ton of runs and miles, doing all kinds of interval and hill training exercises, including building up to half-marathons on the weekend, being super careful with everything I was eating and doing, and starting to get pretty damned ripped, I stopped running and put on a fair amount of “winter weight”.
I basically stalled on moving forward with my podcast, because I just couldn’t bring myself to talk into a microphone without sounding despondent and burned out.
I haven’t touched my book since releasing the last part in October, mostly because I just can’t bring myself to losing another month of progress on my business.
I haven’t been very “social” on the internet or otherwise. I just don’t have anything really positive to say right now, and I just kind of want to be left alone with my own thoughts.
And then throw in getting sick as a dog this past week, and that’s pretty much a recipe to just step back and want to admit defeat.
A lot of people have told me that they like me and my writing because I don’t bullshit.
Well, here you go.
No bullshit.
I’m burned out. I’m torn. And I don’t know how to go forward.
Just to get away from some of this, I started working on an open source project just to have something “exciting” to play with. So when you might think “Wow, he’s even doing an open source SaaS-in-a-box!”, it’s really just a distraction for me from this other shit.
Despite all of my experience building software-based businesses, I’ve never built a startup with ambitions like Tamboo before, and I’ve never had an audience or a following either.
So I’m not sure how to go about “this”.
Because I’ve never done “this” before.
Contrary to what you might think, I don’t have all the answers.
And I’m tired of feeling like I have to.
So I guess I have some decisions I have to make this upcoming year.
Don’t worry — I’m not going to leave anyone high and dry.
I’m still going to finish this book, and I’m still going to keep Tamboo chugging along.
But do I continue to live this split-brain existence?
Do I choose one over the other?
Or do I somehow make them “align”?
Right now, I don’t know.
But I do know that whatever choice I make will shape where I go this coming year, just like the choices I made earlier last year led me to where I am today.
Do I lick my wounds and walk away, choosing one over the other?
Or do I find a way to swing back at both?
Happy Holidays.
And Happy New Year.

Most marketing tactics (content, social media, events, etc.) can be approached from the performance or the branding angle. For example, if you approach content marketing with performance in mind, you’ll focus heavily on tracking keyword rankings, traffic growth, conversion funnels (what content converts, how, where) and create content accordingly. But you can also approach content marketing from a branding perspective and focus more on “awareness”: the emphasis is not on lead and revenue generation, but more on how your brand is perceived.
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
Plenty of founders (still pre-PMF) I meet, believe they have a lead generation problem: they don’t attract enough users and think it’s the reason why their product usage or revenue doesn’t grow (when in fact the problem is, in general, not enough customer discovery). As a consequence, they start doing marketing with performance in mind and expect their blog posts, social media efforts or paid advertising to increase their revenue and user base in the short term.
In most cases it leads to poor results and frustration. In my opinion, founders should invest more time in brand marketing rather than performance marketing at this very early stage.
Ok, at that point you probably think “Clément stop with your bullshit, what does it mean concretely?”.
The early stage SaaS successful at building their brand generally pick a topic around:
Sharing your experience doing X. Founders share their experience building their company, product, exploring a market or else. They write about their lessons learned, failures or openly speak about their metrics. People love it because it makes the company feels very “human”. An excellent example of this approach comes from Front. Matilde, Front’s CEO, did an awesome job sharing her journey while the company was not the success it is today.
Sharing your market vision. Another approach is to be vocal about your vision for the market you operate in. It works especially well when the founders have a strong vision which stands out from the status quo. A great example is Juro, an end-to-end contract management software. Instead of adopting a standard playbook and share a ton of free contract templates (what 99% of the companies in the contract software space do), they decided to adopt a unique approach and speak about the intersection of design and legal (their north star). They clearly stood out from the crowd and generated plenty of awareness in the legal / operation audience.
Company Culture. The third approach that I regularly see, consists of sharing the company culture publicly. Obviously it works better when the startup culture is strong and different. For instance, Sqreen, a security solution, is doing an excellent job at that.
As you can see, your north star should not necessarily be about “problem-solving” for your customers. When you are pre-PMF, you want to inspire/get the attention of the relevant audience and build trust, rather than helping them solve problems that you might not fully understand yet (and that your product doesn’t answer).
*By early stage I mean pre-PMF. Brand marketing is a different game once you scale.
The format doesn’t really matter. I saw early-stage companies successful at building their brand by writing blog posts (content marketing), by being outstanding on social media (ex: many founders creating awareness with great tweetstorms), by participating to podcasts or even by speaking at events.
“Ok, now I understand better what you mean, but if I don’t focus on bringing leads or grow revenue, what’s the point of it?”
I saw the benefits of brand building at several levels:
Recruiting. Building a great brand very early on enables you to attract talents. I witnessed it on multiple occasions.
Nailing messaging / positioning. Very often it forces founders to work on messaging, and positioning, which is good because this aspect tends to be tackled too late.
Market education. In some cases, it’s a great way to conduct market education, especially when you bring an entirely new approach to an industry.
Early adopters. It won’t necessarily bring you a ton of leads, but it will bring you some early adopters, which is useful at that stage.
Customer awareness. By working early on branding, you can create a lot of awareness within a community. I witnessed several times how this awareness enabled to close deals once the product was ready (companies know your brand, and once your product becomes mature enough they will convert more easily).
Investor interest. It’s more a “nice” side effect than something really important, but being good at building your brand can raise the attention of investors.
The common denominator of all the success stories I saw: it’s started as an organic effort lead by passionate founders :-).
You cannot outsource these tasks and the best people to do it are the founders themselves. This is why it’s very important to be passionate about your market as it gives the motivation to share it with the public.

Be the first to respond.
We are in 2019, an unbelievable number of articles, guides, and other white papers has been written about customer discovery already, and yet, I feel like plenty of early-stage founders could spend much more time talking to potential customers.
This post aims to share a very simple and actionable plan to conduct customer discovery at early-stage.
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
Let’s start by defining what the goal of this customer discovery plan is: to articulate clearly Persona — Pain Point — Value Proposition.
Persona: the description of your prospect/customer profile. The more precise this description is, the better.
Pain Point: the pain point you solve for this specific persona. The clearer the pain point is, the better.
Value Proposition: how your product solves (or will) this pain point. The sharper your value proposition is (concise and straightforward), the better.
The goal of this customer discovery campaign is to end up with a very simple spreadsheet where you have ranked two to three (maximum) of these “persona — pain point — value proposition” combinations, validated by enough interviews (> 10). You can keep all the “persona, pain point and value proposition” tested (or that you will test), in a backlog tab.
1- You have a spreadsheet with your personas, but you haven’t spoken to enough prospects.
The majority of founders knows the concept of customer personas and has a spreadsheet listing them. A minority logs the number of interviews they conduct. My personal belief is that before drawing any conclusion, you should discuss with, at least, ten of each persona.
The solution: add in your persona spreadsheet a column with the number of interviews conducted.
2- Your personas, pain points or value propositions are too vague.
As I wrote above, a majority of founders have created their persona spreadsheet, but often the description of the personas, their pain points or the value propositions are too vague. Generally, it’s the sign that the spreadsheet has been created during a team meeting, discussed for a couple of hours, but not validated in real life with enough interviews.
The solution: talk to more prospects until you can articulate precisely the personas, their pain point, and your value proposition.
3- You have too many personas, pain points or value proposition listed
Another sign is when you have twenty different personas listed with ten pain points that your product can solve. I don’t doubt that in some years your product will appeal to a wide range of customers and help them solve plenty problems, but let’s be realistic when you start it’s more likely that you’ll appeal to a precise segment of users for a precise pain-point. Too many personas and pain point listed shows that you haven’t prioritized them well enough or a sign of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).
The solutions: it’s while conducting prospect interviews that you’ll be able not only to define your personas and their pain points better but also to prioritize them. Try to rate these pain points from “nice to have” to “must have”, and focus on the “must have” ones.
Now that we know what we want to achieve, let’s talk about the steps to get there.
Step 1: Set a specific number of prospects you want to interview weekly.
It’s a crucial aspect because having this metric will:
I believe five interviews per week is a good number at the beginning.
Step 2: Set up a customer discovery committee.
Another key aspect is to conduct this customer discovery campaign as a team. Too often I see this task undertaken by the CEO only. Instead, set up a small “customer discovery” committee that will let you:
I think the ideal committee size is three people with different backgrounds. For example, the CEO + a marketing person + a product person is a great combination. Two committee members must interview two prospects / user per week, and the other one only one (not a huge load and you can rotate this allocation).
Step 3: Set up your analysis plan.
For each interview, the interviewer should:
Once per week, or once every two weeks, you should have a committee meeting where you:
Step 4: Set up reporting
Share your findings / lessons learned with the whole company with a simple email after each committee (once or per week / every two weeks).
Step 5: launch the campaign and work in sprints.
Now that you’ve set up everything, you can start the campaign and work in “sprint” mode:
Of course, don’t just execute blindly but iterate based on what works for you.
I’m not an expert at conducting interviews, but I’m a big believer that it shouldn’t be over-engineered at that stage (you don’t need to be an expert at this to execute this plan). In my eyes, what is essential is to keep some key principles in mind:
It’s not about selling; it’s about listening. A common mistake is to believe that you need to convince the person you interview to use your solution or to show how great your product will be. The aim of these interviews is not to find new users, but to make the person talk as much as possible and to listen to her/him as much as possible. It’s by analysing, afterward, what they said that you’ll understand better their pain point and can test different value propositions.
Your aim is to understand each persona deeply. For each persona, you should be able to describe exactly what a typical day for them looks like, what frustrates them, what excites them, how they work etc. It’s not only about what your product can do for them, but about understanding your customers deeply. You have to become an expert at your “persona”, and not just at your product.
You’ll get better while doing it. Don’t be scared if your first interviews are not great or if you don’t start with a well prepared two pages long script. It’s typically the kind of tasks that you need to repeat over and over to get good at. It’s better to iterate often on what you ask, the way you do it than to believe it requires very special skills. Anyone can do it.
If you have any question you can ask me on Twitter / shoot me an email.

Contract sizes are one of the most important inputs into a SaaS company — the dollars that can be extracted per customer is critical to success. Is the annual price customers pay large enough to cover acquisition and operating costs? And then create a profit?
Many SaaS CEOs I speak with constantly have the debate whether to continue to build out their product suite to go up-market, or focus on their current core market. Smaller ASPs or ACVs ( i.e. <$10K) can be sold over the phone, or through a self-serve model often very quickly, while large ASPs ($100K+) are typically sold by field sales reps and entail much longer sales cycles. A business user paying with a credit card or going through legal and other procurement processes are very different. Does a SaaS company need to have high ASPs to be successful?
I looked at ~20 of the fastest growing public software companies and how much they sell their products for — implied subscription ARR over total customers. This is a great proxy for current ASPs. These companies also range in market cap from Salesforce at $50B, to AppFolio at ~$700M. As you can see from the chart below, the ASPs vary greatly. Veeva is a $5.6B market cap company with current ASPs of ~$1M, and Atlassian has a market cap of $6B, but only has a $6K ASP. The largest company in the group, Salesforce, is at $35K. The median of the group is $18K. Much lower than I would have expected for multi-billion dollar public software companies, all of which are growing 25%+ YoY.
Very large and enduring companies can be created with ASPs of <$10K as evidenced in the data above. Furthermore, there is little to no correlation between market cap and ASPs for these 21 companies. A great product and market opportunity are more important factors than how much a company charges. If a product is differentiated, delivers strong value, solves a pain point, and the market is sizable, a successful company can be built through continued execution.
Below is a table with each company’s last quarter ARR, total customers and implied ASPs for reference.

Way back in 2012, in the early days of SaaStr, we wrote a piece challenging everyone out there who dreamed of going freemium in SaaS. That’d you’d need at least 50 million users to build a Unicorn, or at least, to build something big. To challenge you to make sure you can really get at least 10m+ users if you want to truly go the freemium / self-service / no sales route. More of that math here.
Freemium is nothing new. In fact, it’s where most of us start, or close to it. And fast forward to today, now there are many SaaS freemium Unicorns and freemium pre-nicorns, from DropBox to Slack to Mailchimp to Squarespace and Wix and so many more.
But for most of us, we’re going to make it by going a bit upmarket. In fact, a good percentage of the 2,500+ posts and answers on SaaStr can sort of be distilled into two points:
so …
This is how I did it, how Salesforce did, Box did it, Twilio did it, New Relic did it, etc. etc. Start at the bottom of the market, but drive up market, at least partially. Scroll through the BVP cloud index — 90% of the cloud companies that have IPO’d are sales-driven. So far at least. But the companies that have IPO’s already are the past. Not the future.
But a funny thing happened the last half decade. The Cloud got so, so, so much bigger. The shocking explosion of AWS is case study #1 of the jaw dropping movement to the cloud.
And as part of that, every SMB has moved to the cloud.
DropBox crossed 500,000,000 users in fact last year. So if DropBox can get to 500m+ users … is there room for 10–100 other starts to get just 10% as many users — 50m? Of course there is. For every 10 Dropbox users, at least 1 (10%) can use a Trello, a Pipedrive, a Mixmax, etc. That’s 100 SaaS freemium unicorns right there. And even today, Dropbox is $12.50 / user a month (up from $5 before). Most of you will be able to charge more, at least ultimately.
100x more applications should be able to get to $100m+ using a freemium / low-touch model that in the past 10 years. And API and B2D applications have accelerated this trend. Stripe, Sendgrid and others redefined what “freemium” is by putting the decision right in the hand of the developer. This should create 100 more $100m+ freemium or at least freemium-ish B2B/API applications as well.
Most of us will probably still get to $10m+ ARR with a traditional sales team, driving up ACVs, becoming richer and richer solutions. If that’s your fastest path to $100m, go there, and go there fast. If 30% or more of your revenue is from bigger deals, the easiest thing is to build a great revenue team and drive that percentage up. That’s where you’ll get your growth leverage.
But if you have even a hint of freemium success, just a few pieces of advice:
This is and will be the Golden Age of Freemium in SaaS. The Dropbox IPO will kick it off for us. Just a few years ago, only a handful of applications could get to $100m+ in ARR via freemium and self-service. Now, likely, there will be 100 low-touch and freemium unicorns by 2025–2028.
Because the SMB cloud has grown 100x.

Software as a service (SaaS) is its own kind of drug.
Companies and individuals sign up for free trials and are instantly hooked.
For B2B customers, this is especially true. Most businesses hate change. When the ball is rolling, the last thing you want is to overhaul the entire new system. You stick with what’s working, the easy solution. Even if it means a few more dollars.
Time is money to these guys, and saving days, weeks, or even months by switching software is usually a no-brainer. If your product solves a pain point for companies and customers, you’re in business.
You’ve probably heard this, and it’s true. AWS, Salesforce, Slack, Shopify, Intuit…
These companies don’t have physical assets. What they provide and sell is a service — a SaaS product.
These are some of the most valuable and powerful companies in the world. They don’t focus on physical products. They aren’t buying real estate. They don’t invest in cars, gold, or bitcoin. They build businesses others need to have and are willing to pay for.
The beauty of SaaS lies in the margins. Once a piece of code is built, it costs almost nothing to run and maintain a SaaS. You can scale servers and bring on more devs, and the costs never balloon out of control. They stay very small and manageable — a low percentage of the actual price.
And more and more, companies are moving toward these models. The reason: revenue. Recurring revenue is king. It’s the thing all investors and VCs look for. It’s the mark of a healthy business.
How consistent is your cash flow? That’s business basics 101. Money in versus money out.
So let’s talk about what you need to know to kill it with SaaS.
In its simplest form, acquiring customers is a must for every business. How do you get individuals or organizations to pay? That’s the big question.
And for every business, this is different — not the approach, but the end result.
To get customers, you need to get in front of prospective customers. You need to show the value of your product and explain how it will make their lives better, easier, and etc.
(For the sake of argument, let’s say you have an awesome product. If not, please stop reading and go talk to your customers. Figure out what the heck they want and would pay for. Find their pain and fix it.)
OK. So assuming you have a good product, how do we get you users, customers, and etc.?
The strategy depends on the product, the market, and the price point. The higher the price, the more touchpoints you’ll need with prospective customers, and the harder it will be to get impulse buys or downloads.
Let’s cover the strategies and pros and cons of each.
This is the best, most popular, and scalable way to build a business. When your product or service is epic and people love it, they talk about it. Every new user they bring is gold. There’s a $0 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).
But building a referral engine is really goddamn hard. Things don’t just go viral. There’s a science and a bit of luck involved.
Net Promoter Score, or NPS, is the best way to measure virality. It involves polling customers to find their thoughts and affinity towards your brand/product and how likely they are to share with a friend.
There are a lot of ways to increase NPS — the most obvious are a great product and killer customer service.
But virality can also be engineered.
Airbnb offers a free stay for any friend you refer. Groupon gives great deals for large groups. Facebook has an obvious network effect — the more users on the platform, the more valuable it is for you.
How can you engineer something like this into your own product?
That’s the question. In most cases, it’s the difference between greatness and obscurity.
Go brainstorm.
Paid traffic is the fastest and most predictable way to grow. It allows for consistent traffic and specific targeting to grow your customer base. But it also costs money and is very challenging for all but the most experienced marketer.
Whether it’s Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Bing, or YouTube, there are tons of options for running ads. The problem is that it’s all about optimization. You need to lose money to fine-tune the process.
But it also allows for rapid scaling and testing. How else can you get hundreds or thousands of eyeballs on your offer the day after launching?
Paid traffic is great early on for testing offers and saving time. As a long-term strategy, you want to replace as much as you can with more sustainable, low-cost options.
When advertising, be sure to track CAC and LTV (cost of acquisition and lifetime value of customer). Many startups scale with unsustainable unit economics and never realize until it’s too late.
You can sell $1 for 50 cents all day, but no amount of optimization or VC funding will make it worth your while.
Friends and followers are a great way to get the ball rolling. Whether it’s an app or a B2B business, odds are you can get some early adopters, testers, and traction by starting early with social.
Find groups and forums related to your product and ask for advice. Get feedback. Never push your product unless it’s awesome. Otherwise, people will call you a spammer.
Instead, offer special early adopter deals, share your story and goals, and try to earn a little love with the community. Grassroots growth can build a viral movement.
Unfortunately, it isn’t fast. Building a social media following works, but it takes time. Start early and be consistent. Then, perhaps a loyal Pinterest or Instagram following will propel your business in the future.
However, giveaways with email options could work, but make sure the prize is relevant to the product or service you are offering. If not, you’ll end up with a bunch of irrelevant leads and no interest in your product.
There are many types of affiliates. The most prevalent and important are CPA affiliates and content creators. These are very different business models.
Content creators are your traditional blogs, YouTubers, and publications with product images or reviews on their site. When readers are interested, they click through to your offer. For every sign-up, lead, or sale they generate, they earn a commission. This is a great way to build your profile, get links, and grow your distribution.
CPA affiliates, on the other hand, are mercenary advertisers. They run paid traffic to offers and receive a commission on every result. If you find your average LTV is $100, you could offer affiliates a $10–$50 commission for every new user they bring in. The affiliates would advertise for you, trying to spend less than the commission to build a cash cow for themselves.
Affiliates remove the ad spending from your company, but they can also expose your startup to less than stellar clientele, depending on the affiliates you work with. To learn more check out ClickBank and CJ.com. These are both great marketplaces for connecting with affiliates.
Businesses are simpl — they just want to make money. Use this to your advantage. How can you help an existing company or organization add to their bottom line?
For example, Slack-based companies need task management systems, email marketing, and a whole list of other tools. Well early on, before becoming bigshots, Slack might have been able to partner with Asana, Trello, MailChimp, or AWeber to grow together. Some possible arrangements:
HubSpot built partnerships with marketing agencies who act as resellers of its core product. This revenue stream accounts for 40% of its total business.
The opportunities are endless.
The point is, look at how your company aligns with others in the industry (both large and small). Perhaps you can help each other win and grow faster by working together. It just takes an idea and one cold email, and then everything might change.
Pro Tip: Find tons of companies with similar concerns and goals and cold email all of them. The best way is to spray and pray. One or two might just come through.
Most products have relevant marketplaces. Amazon and eBay do physical products. The App Store and Google Play sell apps. Shopify even has its own store for add-ons.
The point is, most marketplaces are valuable. They have a network of users that drives traffic to your offering early on.
Optimizing for each marketplace will be different, but most are similar enough. Based on my experience selling on Amazon, SEO and rankings are all about relevancy, reviews, sales/downloads, and conversion rate.
Every marketplace wants to show the best, most relevant offers to the user. Relevancy is all about SEO. Find the critical keywords and include them in your listing. Google Keyword Planner is a great place to start.
For reviews, ask friends and family. If it’s a good product, you’ll start to get more reviews as you onboard users.
For sales/downloads, always start with a lower price. Lower prices get the ball rolling and boost conversion rates, which marketplaces love to see. The higher the conversion rate, the surer they are that the customer got what they wanted. If your conversion rate is 10% and another is 2%, eventually you will outrank them.
Give the customer what they want. That is how markets make money — on transactions fees. Help them make more money and they’ll help you.
Content is king, or so they say. In my opinion, this is bullshit. Good content combined with good marketing is the answer. Without marketing, content is meaningless noise that never gets on people’s radar.
That said, content is great for lead gen. From blog posts to podcasts, videos to Instagram, the more good stuff you put out there and promote, the more you’re able to position yourself and your company as experts and people worth taking note of.
Content is slow, though. SEO takes forever to deliver results. It’s not a short-term solution. It won’t drive great traffic and sales overnight. It’s worth investing in, though.
And content, like referrals, is a great and cheap way to get users. But it requires planning and a long-term commitment. You need a long timeframe to succeed. Most startups don’t have the time or money for this early on.
A better way: Make one or two killer articles or videos and share them everywhere. Use these for lead gen and scream at the top of your lungs. If they’re great, they’ll start to get some traction and can be used in the sales cycle. I would recommend explainer or sales videos without really selling — just demo and excite. That is the kind of stuff people will share, not sales pitches.
There are two ways to build a bigger business: acquire more customers or increase the lifetime value per customer. The best businesses do both. Churn is the biggest problem SaaS companies faces.
In case this is new to you, churn refers to customers leaving your service. This can be deleting an app, opting out of Netflix, or canceling an account.
Either way, it spells disaster. You work to acquire customers, and so you better be able to keep them. You spent time and probably money for that user and, like a bad relationship, it’s over.
If you haven’t recouped your costs, you lose. Even if their LTV is greater than the cost of acquisition, you’re still missing out on money. And in business, every dollar counts.
Churn happens. There’s nothing you can do to completely stop it.
But, there are plenty of ways to minimize churn. And these are just as valuable, if not more so, than acquiring new customers.
Every phase of the relationship is key to keeping customers. The most important is early on. Whether customers pay upfront or get a free trial, you need to get users hooked on your service from day one. That’s hard to do.
Most powerful products require a bit of explanation to get the full benefit. Do whatever is necessary to get users going.
Usage guides and tutorial videos are huge. They allow users to learn and get started at their own pace. Plus, they’re incredibly scalable from a cost perspective, both for reducing churn and decreasing customer service issues.
A few tips, though. The higher the price point, the more hand-holding may be required. For high-value customers, it may be smart to offer onboarding assistance if needed (and economically viable). Webinars work great as well. Webinars are a scalable one-to-many way to help users.
Record these sessions, and add them to your FAQs. It will make your life easier.
But keep it systematized.
If the system is somewhat complex, consistent email reminders and tutorials can take the hassle out of getting started.
Customer engagement should be a KPI. Remember that and reduce your churn.
This should be obvious, but many founders mess this up. Don’t do what the big corporations do. Dinosaur companies get by despite awful service.
Treat your customers like kings and they’ll stick around:
If your product sucks, no one will stick around. Again, under-promise and over-deliver.
SaaS is great because it’s constantly getting better. Better functionality, more features, greater usability… these are the things customers love and a reason SaaS is eating the world.
There’s no more one and done. Now, you can’t just win your customers over once — you have to wow them over and over again. Customers can quit anytime.
Competitors are constantly innovating, constantly pushing new updates. That’s the beauty of software — it can be quickly changed, upgraded, and improved.
For a startup, that means always pushing code. You should have a set tempo to your dev schedule. If you’re not releasing updates or enhancements every quarter at least, you’re under-delivering.
Pro Tip: Wufoo does this wonderfully. They timestamp updates and inform users on changes and improvements since they last visited. That company cares about me and is constantly making my subscription more valuable. Steal that strategy. Show customers a Since You’ve Been Gone status update, and they’ll see you’re working to wow them.
Scaling software doesn’t take much. With some set costs and small variable fees, you can easily grow a business with big margins.
But who’s your ideal customer? That’s the question.
High-end and mass-market are two very different animals. Either offer the best or offer the rest — there’s little middle ground. Either way, you need to stay competitive to compete.
How does your service compare to your competitors? Overpriced? Underpriced? If you’re not sure, find out.
If you’re first to market, you set the standard.
Ask prospective customers about pricing and what matters to them. Is it cost, usability, support…?
Every company has a different focus. Find your users’ focus and align your pricing and offering accordingly.
Introductory pricing: Many businesses offer introductory low prices to attract users, which works well.
From a user perspective, however, it attracts the wrong type of clients. Companies constantly looking for the best deal churn faster. There’s always a cheaper offer.
Plus, upping the price on a customer feels wrong. Whether they agreed to it or not, contracts like this incentivize the wrong things and misalign startups and their users.
Instead, focus on value and free trials. Fully functional free trials allow customers to play before they pay. This gets them hooked on your product or service and drastically increases conversion rates. Most will stay on after the trial is over, assuming they are engaged.
So…
Every product has a turning point. Users that reach this rarely quit, and those that don’t are bound to leave.
It’s different for every company.
For Facebook, it was the newsfeed. Once users had 10+ friends, stories would show up daily and they were hooked. For Pinterest, it was similar. When a user had over X number of interesting categories, you had a user for life.
But what about B2B?
Just a couple of employees need to join Slack before the whole company decides to join and take control.
And everyone knows Dropbox and Box for cloud storage. Upload your first file and share it with a colleague, and you’ll never go back. Multiple versions of spreadsheets floating through email threads… no thanks.
The examples go on and on.
Every startup has a turning point. In the beginning, every interaction with new users should push them toward that pivotal point.
Figure out what this is for your business and find how to help users get there.
People hate pain. We avoid pain and discomfort more than we work toward health and happiness. That’s just human nature.
How can you make a breakup painful? That’s the question.
Companies that embed themselves in customers’ operations are irreplaceable. Irreplaceable = incredibly valuable.
How do you help your users? What value do they get from your service? What would losing your service mean for them?
Ecommerce sellers use Paypal and Stripe. They help small businesses get paid. Lose that, and their business is bust. These companies have to have their payment provider or they’re screwed.
Hosting. Email Marketing. Advertising. All of these are integrally linked to a business. Any one of them is critical to company success, and losing it would spell disaster, at least for a while.
And there are tons of others just like them. Booted from AirBnB or Uber…so long side income.
Kicked off Amazon — shit.
All of these are examples of mission-critical services. Users almost never leave. Churning would be suicide.
This is the ultimate addiction. Build your business towards this, and you’ll be successful.
Cash is king. Money in the bank means you can grow and scale without worry. For now, at least, your startup is safe.
One way some companies create value is through longer contracts. Look at mobile carriers. AT&T and Verizon built mega empires around cell phone contracts. Sign up for 24 months and get a free phone! And a better rate…
That’s the key, the better rate. Not all companies have sexy bonuses for extended contracts, but all startups can offer a deal. And a deal is often ideal for you. It means upfront cash, even if a user decides to leave.
The key is to focus on LTV, or lifetime value of a customer. Set your plan to outlive your average customer retention and LTV.
For example, if an average customer sticks around for seven months at $100 per month, that’s $700.
But what if you offered a yearly price at 25% OFF. That’s a huge discount. And it’s also $900.
How many potential users would take you up on the bargain? Probably a lot. It may even improve overall conversion rates.
That means $200 more than your average user. And it means more money now.
These type of extended incentives drive profits. Plus, your fixed costs hardly change, which means increased LTV. But that’s not all.
More users probably means more referrals
If a user sticks around and benefits for an extra five months, that’s five more months that they might promote your product. Any extra referrals are icing on the cake.
It’s a win-win for you and your users.
Low fixed costs, near-infinite scalability, and an addictively attractive recurring revenue model have made software the sexiest thing since sliced bread.
Around the world, SaaS companies are starting, growing, and raising around the idea of recurring revenue. The competition is fierce, and the rewards are enormous.
Again and again and again, it comes back to this. You have your ideas, and now you need to execute.
Get Customers.
Retain Customers.
Nothing else is important. Do that, and VCs will come knocking.
You know what to do. Now, go make it happen.

One of the first decisions that a B2B SaaS startup has to make is who its initial customer is going to be. Does the startup go after small businesses (SMBs), enterprises, or something in between (mid-market)? There’s an Old School view and a New School view on this.

Hi there, we’re Point Nine Capital a VC firm focused on SaaS and marketplaces. If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
This is a topic that many people have been discussing for some months in our industry: SaaS feels like a crowded space dominated by a few big companies (SalesForce, Google, Microsoft…) which are not only locking the market in terms of customer share but also have the power to acquire the new rising stars that could “threaten” them (See how SalesForce acquired many AI companies). As this Crunchbase article (The Slow Motion SaaS Crash) explains:
“with so many SaaS companies having been created in the past 10 years, it’s hard to justify, let alone back, new SaaS startups, which are by now competing against established SaaS players, not legacy perpetual license vendors.”
So, is the Golden Age of SaaS behind for investors?*
To answer this question I decided to take a closer look at the BVP Cloud Index and more specifically at the 43 public companies which are worth more than a billion $. I listed them on a spreadsheet with their founding dates:
This simple chart just shows the years when the current 43 $B public SaaS were founded (created, not funded):
But I hear you already; you’ll argue with me that going public takes time and it’s normal that most of the companies on this list are more than 10 years old. The ones born past 2008 will arrive later on the public market.
As a consequence, I looked at the average and median values to IPO, and I found out that it takes on average 9.5 years for a SaaS company to go public (median value is 10 years). So yes, there are very high chances to see more $B companies founded past 2008 go public in the next years.
To double check that I’ve been on Crunchbase and filtered for each year (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013) the Cloud companies that were founded, have raised a significant amount of money as of today, and could become public Cloud unicorns:
Keep in mind that I don’t pretend it’s an exhaustive list. The aim was to quickly check whether I could find for each year potential billion-dollar SaaS. I’m well aware that I probably missed many companies (let me know, and I’ll add them). The point is just to see whether the trend of 3–4 unicorns born per year can continue after 2008 and it seems to be the case.
Note: if we add Nutanix, Purestorage and Sendgrid to the BVP list, then in 2009 we already have four public unicorns.
Conclusion: Is the “Golden Age of SaaS” behind for early stage investors?
As a conclusion there’s no clear evidence that the Golden Age for early stage SaaS investors is behind us.
But undoubtedly times have changed:
And it’s something that you can see from the list of private SaaS unicorns that I shared above. Many of them are not direct competitors to the current SaaS incumbents, but are kings of their “own” category (Invision for design, Onshape for cloud-based CAD tools, Zoom for B2B video communication etc.).
I think we’ll continue to see significant Cloud companies being created, especially in categories / verticals not dominated by SaaS incumbents and for emerging use cases enabled by new technological developments, such as AI & Decentralized Tech (this is why AI is “spreading” faster in industries where “SaaS” is not the dominant model yet, for example see Industry 4.0).
Note *: The notion of “Golden Age” depends on the point of view you chose. In this article I’m speaking about the Golden Age for VCs. But the Golden Age of SaaS for customers, founders or debt providers is not the same.

Top highlight
Zenchef (previously 1001Menus) is a SaaS marketing platform for restaurants. Its mission: save restaurant owners’ time and enhance their day-to-day management in order to make them gain a bigger, more faithful clientele. A few weeks ago, Zenchef was all over the news: they went through a re-branding, raised €6 million with prestigious VCs and business angels, and opened new markets in Europe.
Zenchef’s point of view on Sales is highly enlightening: their target is completely vertical, everything but tech-savvy, and now segmented between different countries that obey different rules.
Nevertheless, in just 4 years, the team managed to scale its sales strategy — with a few hick-ups along the way. Xavier Zeitoun, Zenchef’s CEO, shared with us all of his techniques, methodologies, management tricks, and screw-ups in the most straight-forward way.
In this article, you will find:
- the process through which the (killer) startup went in order to build a scalable sales strategy
- sales hiring and management tips learned the hard way
- methodologies, sales scripts, and templates for you to use and adapt to your own business
Enjoy your read!
The very first iteration of Zenchef’s product (at the time it was called 1001 Menus) was simply to offer restaurants to add them to all directories- they iterated from there. They had discovered that restaurant owners had such a need after trying out to build a first venture, similar to MenuPages, which failed — but gave them a first network of restaurateurs.
Zenchef started its sales strategy in June 2012, without any marketing strategy to bring in leads, following the simple logic than the fastest trajectory to sign a client was to go out and meet them.
2 out of 3 founders opened the Yellow Pages in the “Restaurants” section and went from A to Z, cold-called them and came to the restaurant’s doors with an iPad to show them their product.
The sales pitch:
The results: they signed their first 50 paying clients over the summer with no product (!) At the time, they only showed mockups of the products, as they needed to prove there was a need for their solution.
Once they proved they were able to sign clients on their product, their next step was to hire 3 more sales rep to continue the same efforts, and then hired 5 more. The methodology was the same: cold-calling with no targeting whatsoever and no tools: they all worked with Excel sheets.
Sales recruitment / management: following their will to build a young and dynamic team, the founders hired young graduates with no experience, and didn’t give them any sales pitch to practice.
Their main methodology were “Commando operations”: once a week, all sales reps were to go door-to-door, meet 60 restaurant owners and get 10 demos scheduled for the following week.
The results: with 3 sales reps, they went from 50 to 350 restaurants in Paris, in 6 months. With 8, they reached 650 clients.
When the founders tried to raise funds, VCs were categorical: “We don’t invest in car fleets”, meaning a growth strategies based on sales reps selling face-to-face was not scalable: Zenchef would soon need to send their teams all across France on company cars.
In addition to VC’s remarks, the “Ah-ah moment” occurred when Xavier realized that he was about to switch from his good-old Excel sheet to Salesforce thanks to a great sales rep he was in touch with… over the phone. He had never met him and that was ok: why not do the same with Zenchef and do demos online instead of face-to-face?
Xavier started testing his new idea by locking himself up in his office during a month and tried to sell his product over the phone.
“The first client I closed was even located on the very same street, just 20 numbers away!” recalls Xavier
The pitch was: “I realized a diagnosis of your restaurant’s online visibility and comparison with your competitors. I can show you over a 30 min demo, it’s free and no obligation to purchase”. The conversion rate was 40% — compared to a 10% rate when the pitch simply was: “Hey, I’d like to talk about my product”.
All sales rep were handling the full funnel: they cold-called, prepared the diagnosis, did the demos and onboarded clients. They were logging all leads in Salesforce manually and had to try 20 times to get a demo with a client before giving up (experience showed that big successes happened between attempt #15 and 20.) In addition to Salesforce, they used Twilio to remind their prospects via text message, as most of them were not checking their emails during the day and forgot their appointment easily, creating a high no-show rate.
A radical change in hiring and managing: As the existing sales team was focused on face-to-face sales, the founders decided to opt for new profiles: inside sales with 15 years of experience selling to small businesses.
To assess their performance, the management used classic KPIs: the number of calls per rep, the number of scheduled demos, the number of closed deals, and the conversion in between each step of the funnel.
The results: over the summer of 2013, the team reached 800 clients, including their first outside of Paris.
As commando operations and face-to-face demos stopped, the existing sales team struggled to switch to phone sales, and eventually, the management decided to let them go. The cohabitation between the young team about to transition, and the more experienced, new team members, was a hard time for the company.
“I recall prioritizing experience and efficiency over company culture, which was a mistake.” says Xavier.
In October 2013, the team went back to VCs to raise another round of funding and grew the team from 3 to 10 inside sales. With 10 people in your sales team, you need to set up processes and methodologies.
The new, more accurate sales pitch:
The script is meticulous and constructed around 3 pillars:
The number #1 rule for speaking time allocation is: 80% for the leads, 20% for the sales person. Every question entails 10 others which are can be all leveraged for your sales arguments.
As restaurant owners are low-tech, the sales team relies on “Join me” for scheduling demos: it doesn’t require to install any software and is highly easy to use for them.
The results: today, 35% of demos turn into closed deals.
At first, the management team was listening to their sales reps to provide individual feedback, but soon realized they were always repeating the same advice. As a consequence, they chose to organize training days around certain topics.
In addition, they created an assessment grid on 200 topics that they performed on all new recruits after a 15 days trial. The most important criteria were the “discovery phase” points: you’re a good sales rep if you manage to have your prospect speak about his business.
“For a startup, the real accomplishment is when you manage to switch from a success based on a sales rep’ talent to a success based on the company’s ability to build a methodology that works every time. That’s human scalability.” says Xavier.
Starting in the beginning of 2014, Xavier realized that certain members of his team were better at demos, others at cold-calling, but they couldn’t specialize in any task as they were responsible for the whole funnel.
The new team’s structure then became:
The results were measured using classic SaaS metrics. At this point, taking into account the specificities of your business is crucial. In his article “How cheap a product can you have and still have Salespeople?”, Jason Lemkin (a.k.a the SaaS guru) claims your minimum Annual Customer Value must $3000 — and he’s pretty categorical about it.
Zenchef’s product costs and still is — $1k / year / customer. But the inside sales team is in France, where junior sales cost about twice less than in the U.S: Zenchef’s CAC is, in fact 650€, profitable in 6 months!
As the sales team grew and got structured, Zenchef got itself a marketing department, as part of their scaling strategy: they needed more leads.
The marketing strategy was built on the very specific context of the restaurants’ markets. A classic Adwords approach wouldn’t work: the potential reach for “website creation for restaurants” keywords was about 10 clicks a month!
The team realized that restaurant owners’ first interlocutors were their providers, and started building partnerships with them: they relied on the providers’ sales rep to sell their product, on a shared-revenue basis. The first large-scale partnership they closed was with Metro, covering 70% of French restaurants.
Thanks to this partnership, lead generation jumped to 400–500 leads a month. Using Hubspot, the sales team were capable of qualifying their leads according to their level of knowledge of the product and pushed them customized content to warm them up.
Because of the specificity of its market, Zenchef’s product needs to be highly localized and integrally translated. In addition, they need to adapt their sales strategy to the structure of the market locally.
In France: 80% of restaurants are independent owners, very low-tech and not inclined to work on online marketing.
In the U.K: most restaurants are part of chains, they are more mature in terms of digital marketing.
In Spain: the market is more similar to France, and Zenchef’s historical partner Metro is already very active there.
As a consequence, Zenchef’s sales approach differs from one country to another: in the U.K, sales reps can use “marketing words” with their prospects, sales take a long time, are more complex, and require face-to-face meetings. Xavier relied on his partner Metro to open Spain and got hundreds of leads right away.
“Our vision for the months to come is to install a global EU sales team in one city. We need to scale management, processes, office space, and we need to enable all information to be distributed across teams as fast as possible.” says Xavier.
In their scope: Barcelona, Spain. The city is full of highly qualified students, real estate is cheaper than most European cities, and not to mention: the climate is very appealing!
Zenchef’s CEO also states his ambition to restore the image of the “Inside Sales” job. In France, B2B Sales — confused with B2C phone sales — is poorly recognized as an interesting, rewarding job, whereas in the U.S, inside sales people are often times highly educated and capable of closing deals worth several thousands of dollar over the phone. Zenchef’s team is already well-paid and well-trained: way to go!

https://saasholic.com/brasil-saas-landscape-2017-a-primeira-pesquisa-sobre-o-mercado-saas-no-brasil-5a6e6669cd6e?source=search_post---------72,"As lições de mais de 400 startups SaaS, em uma pesquisa única sobre o mercado brasileiro.
Empresas brasileiras estão cada vez mais abertas à adoção de soluções de TI no modelo de Software-as-a-Service. Segundo uma pesquisa feita pela Capgemini no Brasil, SaaS é o modelo mais utilizado para entregar serviços pela nuvem, com 92% das empresas adotando pelo menos uma solução SaaS.
Hoje, estamos felizes em anunciar os resultados da primeira edição da Brazil SaaS Landscape Research. Nós entrevistamos 597 respondentes em Maio de 2017, sendo 49% deles CEO’s de startups SaaS (o segmento em que focamos a nossa pesquisa). O relatório é o resultado de uma iniciativa conjunta entre a SaaSholic, Rock Content, Signal Hill e Redpoint eVentures.
Nós acreditamos que essa pesquisa é uma representação precisa do ecossistema de startups SaaS no Brasil atualmente. Vemos esse recorte como um forte indicador de que o mercado de software-as-a-service brasileiro atingiu um ponto de inflexão, o estágio onde, a partir de agora, o crescimento do mercado é inevitável.
Tivemos o prazer de apresentar a pesquisa em primeira mão no Assinaturas Day 2017, o maior evento para assinaturas e empresas SaaS do Brasil. Você pode conferir o vídeo na íntegra aqui.
A pesquisa tem como objetivo criar um benchmark confiável para todos os players do ecossistema brasileiro de SaaS, e ajudar a entender:

Quase 50% das startups SaaS são baseadas em São Paulo, e 41% das startups que ultrapassaram R$ 1mi em ARR também são baseadas em SP.
Santa Catarina (onde a RD é sediada) está em segundo lugar, com um ritmo acelerado de crescimento. De acordo com Diego Wagner, fundador da Meetime (uma plataforma de Inside Sales) a comunidade SaaS em SC está crescendo rapidamente, graças à RD, fundadores de outras startups, e colaboradores, que estão fomentando o crescimento da comunidade através de workshops, investimento anjo e mentoria.
Minas Gerais ocupa o terceiro lugar. De acordo com Drew Beaurline, fundador da Construct — um app de comunicação e acompanhamento para construtoras — a comunidade local de SaaS está sendo alimentada por programas do governo, como o SEED MG. “Como um empreendedor com zero de capital disponível, fiquei impressionado por poder contratar um desenvolvedor sênior por uma fração do custo (se comparado a São Francisco, EUA) e também com a quantidade de programas de aceleração do governo baseados em equity”.
Drew se mudou da Califórnia para Belo Horizonte e notou que a primeira aquisição do Google fora dos Estados Unidos foi uma startup de Belo Horizonte chamada Akwan.
Na nossa pesquisa, ficamos surpresos ao constatar que mais de 71% das empresas SaaS no Brasil são movidas por investimentos próprios. Considere a Superlógica: a empresa cresceu com financiamento próprio, chegando a 5 mil clientes e mais de 130 funcionários. “Nós crescemos mais de 100% em 2016. Nosso objetivo em 2017 é triplicar nossa receita, com o lançamento da nosso próprio serviço de pagamento”, conta Carlos Moura, Chief Growth Officer da empresa.
Daquelas que escolheram buscar por capital, somente 10% levantou mais que R$ 10 mi (~US$3 mi). Por outro lado, estamos vendo um grande interesse dos VC’s locais em empresas SaaS. Fundos como Redpoint (RD, Gympass, Olist), Monashees+ (Conta Azul, RunRun.it) e Ebricks (Rock Content, Contabilizei, ERPFlex) estão apostando alto no mercado SaaS. Se tratando de valuations, a média do múltiplo do AAR para rodadas SaaS é de 6x.
Se você olhar para um negócio SaaS público e maduro nos EUA, você vai descobrir que várias empresas levam mais que 12 meses para recuperar seus custos de aquisição de clientes. No Brasil, essa não é a realidade.
Entre os respondentes da pesquisa, mais de 60% das empresas recuperam seu CAC em menos de 6 meses. Além disso, startups locais possuem finanças saudáveis. 67% delas têm uma relação de LTV/CAC superior a 3, algo que deixaria o David Skok orgulhoso.
“Antigamente no Brasil, você precisava visitar seus clientes e conhecê-los pessoalmente. Agora, você pode fazer todo o processo online e seus clientes estão felizes com isso”, afirma Rafael Faria, Gerente de Inside Sales da Rock Content, uma das empresas locais referência em SaaS.
Aparentemente, startups SaaS brasileiras abraçaram o inside sales como seu principal canal de distribuição, sendo usado por 52% das empresas. Vendas de campo (42%) e vendas self-service (37%) seguem como os canais mais utilizados no Brasil.
26% das empresas pesquisadas possuem algum componente de marketplace em suas ofertas. Empresas como Gympass e Rock Content adotaram características do marketplace em seus produtos SaaS, e parecem ter sucesso com isso. De acordo com Rodrigo Baer, ter um componente desse modelo de negócio ajuda startups a criar barreiras para a entrada de competidores estrangeiros no mercado, utilizando suas redes de contato como vantagem.
Por outro lado, em nossa pesquisa, não encontramos nenhuma correlação entre o componente de marketplace e as taxas de sucesso (e crescimento) do negócio.
Com um mercado local enorme e alto potencial de clientes, produtos e empresas estão muito focados no Brasil. Os produtos SaaS locais não são clones dos seus homólogos norte-americanos, e na maioria das vezes, adaptam o negócio às necessidades locais e empecilhos burocráticos criados pelo governo.
Contabilizei, por exemplo, foca em ajudar PME’s a gerenciar suas finanças. Como no Brasil uma empresa é obrigada por lei a ter um contador, eles criaram um produto que substitui a necessidade de contratar um profissional externo. Se adotarmos uma visão internacional, a maioria das empresas escolhe por postergar essa decisão.
E quando chega a hora de internacionalizar o negócio, as SaaS’s brasileiras tendem em focar seus esforços de expansão em outros países da América Latina, pela proximidade geográfica e competição reduzida.

Nós gostaríamos de agradecer a todos os parceiros e empresas que nos ajudaram a promover e preencher essa pesquisa. Esse relatório será muito importante para o desenvolvimento do nosso ecossistema e para futuros benchmarks.
Estamos empenhados em transformar esse projeto em uma pesquisa anual, para acompanharmos juntos o crescimento desse modelo de negócio no Brasil.

This post is part of our series covering the SaaS industry. You can find all our SaaS related stories on the P9 Capital Medium Channel. Many thanks to @chrija and @ncsh for their inputs and feedback.
For many SaaS startups inbound marketing has become one of the first customer acquisition strategies which they adopt at the beginning of their adventure. The main reasons being that it’s easy / inexpensive to set up (from choosing a blogging platform to distributing content on social media) and that we all have experience with inbound marketing at some level (almost all SaaS founders read other SaaS companies’ blog and consume content through platforms like Hacker News / Twitter / LinkedIn).
But getting real results with inbound can take time and many trials and errors.
On the following diagram I’ve tried to sum up a “typical” Inbound Marketing journey that an early stage SaaS might experience. It’s the result of my experience with different SaaS startups, so I don’t pretend it’s universal nor that it covers every aspect of it. Please feel free to send your comments on Twitter (@clemnt).
The diagram is structured the following way:
You can download the large version here
When you first start with inbound marketing, chances are high that you’ll begin with very limited resources (people & money). This is why in most cases inbound marketing equals “a company blog” at that stage, with the founders as the content writers, eventually helped by an intern.
There are two huge challenges at that point:
The first is to build the narrative around your blog, coherent with your product, your brand and your customers (= your marketing “North Star” on the graph). It might sounds obvious for a SaaS company (you’ll speak about the problems your product solves, right?) but it’s actually tricky as you shouldn’t fall into the “tool only” narrative (you’re not selling a tool but a solution).
Very often we tend to be too “self centered”: speaking about OUR product, OUR vision and how WE’re going to change how people will do X or Y. We’ll learn later that being “customer centric”, even for inbound marketing, is actually a more effective approach.
The second challenge comes from the underestimation of the “distribution” component. Many people think that if they write great content, distribution will follow automatically (Twitter virality, #1 on Hacker News…). The truth is that each content distribution channel has its specificities and you need to experiment / learn a lot before you can really leverage them.
Hence the second stage: disappointment.
You’ve put a lot of effort into writing several long form articles with nice pictures, but your traffic is not taking off. And it seems that people are not amazed by your content and not directly upvoting / RT’ing you when you post your article on Hacker News or Twitter. But you’re not dumb, so you decide to really think about distribution and to stop focusing on production only. Here comes the first growth phase.
You’ve done your job of reading lots of materials from founders who have shared their secrets on how to perform on channel X and Y or guides from Hubspot or KISSmetrics. You’ve also experimented yourself quite a lot with your first articles, so you now start to really understand how distribution works.
Now it’s time to write some great pieces of content and to adapt them a bit to each channel / audience you’re targeting. And since people don’t seem to make the effort to directly upvote / share what you’ve written, a little Slack circle with some other startup friends, where you help each other, will be useful.
And the magic happens! You finally manage to generate several thousands views and hundreds of Facebook or Twitter sharings. Congratulations!
But soon reality hits you:
What you finally realize is that being “hit” driven is actually a very hard to maintain strategy and that every time you’re sharing something you’re dependent upon external distribution channels. You have no traffic “safety net” and every time it’s fly or die.
Again, you’re quite intelligent so you decide to stop this madness before you burn out and you decide to reboot your strategy.
At that point it’s also very important to say that you’ve probably acquired much more knowledge about your customers, their needs, your industry etc. (because you didn’t spend your whole time writing articles, you’ve also built a product, interviewed customers, tried to sell it…). And, I will never insist on that enough, the knowledge you build from running your startup / selling your product must permeate your marketing effort.
So now that you’re not progressing anymore with your content distribution it’s time for a strategy reboot, taking everything that you’ve learned into consideration:
If you are well organised and if your narrative really clicks with your audience then it’s time to grow again. This time for real. Until the next plateau :-)

I have had the occasion to do a workshop at the SEED Summit organised by HEC Paris last week. It was a good occasion for me to go back there. I shared a few things I have learned as a student, as an aspiring entrepreneur, and as VC focused on SaaS at Point Nine.
Some people have asked me to share the slides after the conference. I thought a good thing would be to share to a larger audience here.

Top highlight
When we first added pricing to EmailOctopus in late 2015 our philosophy behind the pricing was simple. To be significantly cheaper than our competitors.
It’s worth considering, at the time, the platform was only a side-project alongside the salary and security that a full-time role could offer. The money provided by EmailOctopus was ‘beer-money’ and we were yet to anticipate becoming a full-time business. In side-projects, that attitude is not unusual, any money you make from it you treat as a bonus — and it can lead to you undervaluing your time and more importantly, your business.
Underpricing your side project at an early stage makes it so much more difficult to turn it into a full-time business. If you start out only charging $5 per month per plan, then you’ll require 1000 paying users before getting close to matching your Silicon Valley/London developer salary. It’s so easy to get trapped in this circle, where you charge low amounts (because you can) but then can’t afford to grow the business to become what it’s fully capable of.
The most important thing to remember when running your SaaS is that users use you for the value you provide. Ask yourself regularly, are our customers getting value from our product? Would their value still significantly outweigh the pricing, if we increased our prices? Identify what users consider the value in your product. As an email marketing platform, we get so wrapped up on sending emails that we often forget that our users are not paying us to do that. They’re paying us to deliver emails, so they can communicate with their customer base.
Competing on price is a very acceptable thing to do. If your SaaS is a simpler or lighter version of an established product, then it’s a great approach to reduce your pricing so you can capture those users who don’t need all the bells and whistles that more expensive alternatives offer. At EmailOctopus, that’s our core proposition — we focus on making email marketing simple and cost effective. We don’t have the bloat of Mailchimp with their Facebook ad campaign tools and mobile apps, nor do we have the need to have hundreds of deliverability engineers (as Amazon SES handle deliverability for EmailOctopus customers) our pricing reflects that.
One benefit of increasing prices is that a shift upstream can often bring a better standard of customer. As a hugely discounted email marketing platform, we left ourselves open to spammers and less desirable customers who required a lot of support and monitoring. Users who understand the value of a product to their business, will pay for it. They’re the users you want.
This is a question only you, within your SaaS business can answer and it’s based on research that you’ll need to conduct. You’ll need to consider a few things:
Your cost of acquisition. Many companies offer affiliate schemes where they offer affiliates a significant cut of MRR. Their prices have to be adjusted to reflect this, in extreme cases such as ConvertKit, they offer 30% commission to affiliates. Essentially meaning, your prices need to be 30% higher. Google paid ads (Adwords) aren’t cheap either, nor are Facebook ads. You’ll need to consider the impact of pricing on the life-time value of customers, as the LTV is higher you can afford to bid more. One benefit of increasing prices is the fact that you can spend more on advertising to them.
The value of your product. This I’ve spoken about in depth above, but the more value you provide the more you can charge. Consider the various personas who use your platform to ensure your pricing and plans reflect the value you are offering to each of them. PriceIntelligently have a number of great blogs on this, which I’d suggest reading. Our last round of pricing changes saw an extra plan added — we added this after researching and analysing the existing plans and usage patterns of our existing customers.
What are your competitors charging? At EmailOctopus, our core proposition is that we are priced at a significantly cheaper rate than Mailchimp. We offer a simpler, lighter platform and have a belief that email marketing is overpriced. One thing we really spend time on before changing our prices is doing a huge amount of research into what our competitors offer, which we display in a regularly updated spreadsheet. That research doesn’t always lead to a price increase, indeed our most recent change included an extension to our free plan ensuring we remained one of, if not the, cheapest platform available.
There are various ways companies treat their existing customers, with the most common being grandfathering. When grandfathering you essentially don’t increase prices for customers who remain on the same product for the lifetime of the account. As a company scaling up, you may see this as a fair way to treat the users who supported you in the beginning and it’s what we do at EmailOctopus. Our early customers were a gift to us, they helped us learn more about our pricing model and helped drive the direction of the product, we love to treat them well.
The other alternatives are offering discounts to existing customers. In the case of a grandfather discount, you would agree with your customer to retain the same low pricing for the coming 6 or 12 months — ensuring you treat them fairly but do reap the benefits of the extra revenue in the mid term. Discounts are much easier to justify if there has been a notable, but perhaps not significant improvement to their plan.
The bravest decision is to immediately increase their prices to your new plans. Before doing this you’ll want to check that your customer base is not too price sensitive. If you’ve spent the last 3 years advertising yourself as the cheapest around and then increase pricing to be on par, if not greater than, competitors then the likelihood is you’ll upset a few customers. Immediate, direct price increases are most easy to do if you have made a significant improvement to the platform which the customer will enjoy on their plan. You’ll need to explain this increase to customers carefully and clearly. It’s something Expensify did particularly well here.
After a price increase, keep an eye on your conversion rates (lead>paid and visit>lead) and the impact on new customers. A well considered price increase almost always won’t significantly impact conversion rates, but will certainly increase ARPA (average revenue per account).
Increasing your SaaS businesses ARPA is the fastest way to grow your monthly revenue without worrying about scaling marketing spend or comprising your tech stability.
At EmailOctopus it’s helped us scale, make further hires and invest more back into the product. Something we couldn’t have done without losing the side-project ideology we started with.

Startups at a very early stage (<12 months) often have a limited amount of data to use to quantitatively assess their product-market fit. With this limited data, what other metrics can founders and investors use to gauge product-market fit and traction to benefit operational efficiency and investment potential? Focusing specifically on enterprise SaaS businesses, one potential option is to use “trial” data as a leading indicator to go one level deeper to understand the potential growth trajectory and where the business is going.
44% of enterprise SaaS companies use trials to get their customers in the door. Paired with the table-stakes metrics of strong MRR (monthly recurring revenue) growth, low churn, a short CAC payback period), trial data metrics can provide another leading indicator for early investments as a “quantitative lens” to anecdotal rave reviews from customers.
Here, we dig into two pieces of trial data can be used as a leading indicator for evaluating early-stage SaaS startups:
Trials are a particularly interesting as customers who have signed up for a trial have demonstrated strong initial interest, and jumped through all the hurdles to signup. Unlike freemium models, most trials require customers to enter a credit card, a proxy that demonstrates increased interest. In the long-run, by channel, the split of self-serve revenue from trials versus direct purchase can be as high as up to 50/50 making it a critical indicator versus other on-boarding funnel metrics.
If you have an early stage enterprise SaaS company with strong net new MRR growth, low churn, and MoM high degree of trial starts (where the unconverted trials would not be reflected in net new MRR), it could mean the company has a high growth trajectory down the road and is more interesting in the long-run.
For startups at a very early stage, the revenue data may not quite be there yet as you only have a few months-sized cohorts. But, if you’re getting a lot of trial starts, even if they haven’t converted yet, provides an interesting positive leading indicator of what may come and points to latent growth opportunity as well as the degree of product-market fit.
To see this, we take a fictional SaaS startup that uses trials, take the new, expansion, and contraction revenue, and then stack unconverted trials MRR on top on a cohort basis (Unconverted trial MRR calculated by # of licenses trial signed up for* ASP) to provide another layer of quantitative depth.
Stacking unconverted trial MRR on top gives us more information on the growth trajectory of the business by seeing what money has been left on the table through the pipeline of trial starts. This isn’t captured in net new MRR because these trials didn’t convert, but is also not captured in new user growth data because for SaaS companies that aren’t in a freemium model, you are only a user after you have become a customer.
Now let’s take two fictional example companies. Company A and B have similar new monthly recurring revenue, and cancelled MRR month over month and above average trial conversion rates. But, once you stack on unconverted trial monthly recurring revenue, company B has 3x more unconverted trial MRR left on the table (axes are the same here). With this data, you can see that company B has a lot of latent opportunity of unconverted trials in the pipeline that isn’t reflected in its current new MRR.
Given comparable above average conversion rates, Company B’s high number of raw trial starts indicates more market interest and customer awareness and potentially better initial product-market fit than company A even with <15 month limited data. As company B improves its trial conversion rate over time which companies do as they mature, it could have a more interesting growth trajectory in the long-run.
For more granularity, zooming in, we can further split new MRR by channel into “New MRR from direct purchases” vs. “New MRR from trials” (and to keep the new MRR direct purchase vs. trial ratio in mind) before we stack the unconverted trial MRR data . These sub-components help answer where new MRR is coming from and how growth is being driven as well as the latent opportunity in unconverted trial MRR.
From an operating perspective, a startup can leverage this granularity to better improve their product-market fit by understanding why the product got a customer’s attention, but was unable to convert them (e.g. communicating product value clearly, common customer use cases, etc.) as well as develop LTV on a cohort basis of customers that come in via trials versus direct purchases and leverage that data to understand the value of the product to different customer archetypes.
Another metric within trial data to leverage as a leading indicator is the % of customers who convert before the trial end date to assess spikes in product-market fit.
Say both Company A and B have an overall trial-to-purchase conversion rate of ~30%. Typically, customers on a trial who convert do so on the day the trial expires as an automatic charge (14-days, 30-day period, etc.), but if you dive in deeper to understand the day-by-day layer of conversion, the data tells you something different. Here, looking at a specific cohort of trial customers and which day they converted through the 14-day trial period:
In this example, Company A follows a typical conversion pattern where most trial customers convert on day 14 after a trial ends. Company B, however, spikes and has 2x the conversion into a paid customer on the Day 0 of the trial versus Company A. This is a signal that Company B’s product is able to get to that “wow” moment much earlier and potentially indicates a higher product-market fit.
Using the % of customers who convert the before trial end date (in this case 12.5%) is a quantitative way to look at rave customer reviews to confirm customer validation. In this case, company B could be a really compelling investment (especially if the ASP of the product is high) compared to company A given the unique spikes in day 0 conversion throughout the trial period.
From an operational aspect, companies can use this framework to gauge the degree of their product-market fit as well as how well they are communicating their product value to customers. For example, one method is to breakdown the exact engagement activity during Day 0 necessary to make the customer successful (e.g. setting up account, provisioning licenses, etc. a la Twitter follow 5 friends magic number) in order to improve the on-boarding flow.
**Note that day of trial conversion is a slightly weaker leading indicator as most customers will probably not convert early during their trial period (<10% of a cohort). However, for companies that do have this earlier conversion, it provides a very strong signal for product-market fit as only a particularly compelling product could drive spikes in this.
Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate — This framework pays less attention to the trial-to-paid conversion rate and more on actual trial data due to the many confounding factors that can dramatically affect the conversion ranging from trial duration to credit card information upfront to the number of licenses selected at trial start to the strength of the on-boarding flow.
That said, based on industry benchmarks, if the overall trial-to-paid conversion rate is 50%+, it’s extremely good, and if it’s below <10%, there may be a broader product-market fit problem. In which case, if the company does not have a strong SaaS metrics to start with, and net new MRR is driven heavily by trials as opposed to direct purchases, would recommend not using the above trial metrics as a leading indicator.
Freemium model — The other common method for SaaS businesses to get customers in the door is the “freemium” model (e.g. Slack, Dropbox Pro, etc.), and in many cases companies use both freemium and trials. For companies who use both freemium and trials (e.g. Intercom, etc.), trial data is another datapoint to serve as a leading indicator for “business” products versus individual premium users (e.g. Intercom Acquire vs. gated free individual), and doesn’t address the freemium portion. In this case, given the unconstrained “time” nature of freemium (as opposed to a constrained 14-day trial duration), and more available user data, MAUs and user engagement data are much stronger leading indicators to evaluate the growth trajectory of the business.
Direct sales model — This framework only applies to self-serve sales SaaS businesses as opposed to a more hands-on direct sales B2B models. For direct sales enterprise models, Jason Lemkin’s Lead Velocity Rate (LVR) metric applies a similar logic with workable leads at a more mature stage. Other similar leading indicators are Marketing Qualified Leads and whether they are increasing over time in order to gauge future new MRR.
This “trials” framework could also be applied for some consumer companies, but as a leading indicator is much murkier given the broad swath of ways a consumer company can engage users. MAUs/DAUs/archetype engagement metrics are much better data-points to draw from.
However, one case is where certain tactics can be used as a proxy. For example, Sprig offers $10 off the first order, effectively subsidizing it — so the first order can be considered a “trial”. Using a cohort analysis, we can split out all first time users via promos as a “trial” within MAU growth accounting. From there seeing the conversion or drop-off rate after the first order or “trial” can indicate —
1 — There is a strong market awareness and interest in the product at the top of the funnel and there is enough stickiness to go through the signup process.
2 — But, the experience is or is not compelling enough whether it is the food or delivery experience. This number can also be captured in the repeat order rate as well.
Like enterprise SaaS companies, we can use this additional layer of detail to split out first order vs. recurring orders to assess the growth trajectory of the business. That said, this is a much weaker leading indicator for consumer companies compared to other engagement metrics.
Further validate the above two metrics, using a robust amount of of early enterprise SaaS company data, the next step is to establish the target benchmarks and standardize across companies to use for early stage investment diligence the:
Note: The idea here is to provide another leading “datapoint” to assess early enterprise SaaS companies who use trials. At the early stage, a strong team is critical as well as a market in which there is conviction, vision, core product, and strong numbers in MAU and MRR (>4 SaaS quick ratio), etc.

Architectures for multi-tenant SaaS aim for two conflicting goals:
Costs are typically kept low by sharing as many as possible resources across tenants. Separation requires exactly the opposite: avoid sharing resources between tenants.
For us, this tradeoff came to a head when we wanted to go freemium while enterprise customers brought more and more demanding requests for data separation and tenant-specific configuration.
We had the following architecture in place when the need for freemium came up:
Running Kubernetes and Kafka clusters added so much complexity and cost that it wasn’t feasible to run tenant-specific clusters. Instead, we ran one shared Kubernetes and one shared Kafka cluster for all tenants.
Data was separated between tenants solely via encryption. Although this worked, it turned out to be highly complex (and thereby error-prone). Certain things proved to be particular challenging, for example, preventing tenant-specific data to mix in logs and backups from shared systems.
Sooner or later we had to face the facts: Keeping the shared Kubernetes/Kafka clusters would make it increasingly hard to serve enterprise customers. Running separate Kubernetes/Kafka clusters would immediately kill our freemium plans.
Time for a fresh start. We had to split the tenant resources AND dramatically reduce costs per tenant.
We achieved this by splitting the tenants and by replacing the data and business functionality layer with serverless technologies:
All resources for a — now split — tenant are placed in a dedicated AWS account — offering strong tenant separation. Each AWS account has therefore its own instances of DynamoDB tables and Lambda functions.
To keep the multitude of AWS accounts manageable, we added centralized deployment infrastructure, which provisions the tenant-specific environments.
Moving each tenant into a separate AWS account solved the first part of the puzzle: We can offer strong tenant separation. Yet, the cost per tenant is still way above $0, making it unsuitable for a freemium model.
We therefore added the concept of a “partition”. Each partition is deployed into a dedicated AWS account and can hold multiple tenants. This means we can have many cheap tenants within one partition, which are strongly separated from all tenants in other partitions.
We add all our freemium tenants into one partition, bringing their marginal cost down to ~$0. Enterprise tenants are placed in dedicated partitions, giving them strong separation.
The change of architecture achieved our two main goals: We can offer much stronger separation to enterprise customers and the marginal cost for freemium tenant is very close to $0.
We reaped also some unexpected benefits:
Happy coding!

Software-as-a-Service is a one of my favourite business models and it’s not hard to see why:
At Point Nine (where I spent the past 4 years) we invested in over 35+ companies in this sector alone and Christoph and Clement regularly publish our learnings on the Angel VC blog and P9 Medium channel. Sometimes I like to pitch in. :)
Feature, Product & Company–Market Fit
Something that I spent time thinking about recently are what I like to call ceilings in SaaS: How to properly evaluate how far a SaaS play can go in terms of MRR/ARR and therefore what exit potential it can achieve. One investor I discussed this with differentiated between three kinds of SaaS: Features, products and ‘real’ companies. While this classification is certainly a simplification (and could be offensive to smaller, profitable SaaS businesses that are still real companies), the idea of differentiating between three kinds of SaaS/market fit is a very helpful rule of thumb for assessing the potential of a SaaS company. To make it clearer, take a look at this:
Obviously these ranges are up for discussion, but the core question should be clear: Where is the invisible ceiling at which point the company starts to grow slower (below some 5% per month) and begins to plateau. In my eyes the rough levels are:
Of course there is nothing wrong with building a $1–10m ARR business and naturally a $10m+ ARR companies can already be very profitable and achieve great exits. If you are out to raise from growth VCs and chase the holy grail of an IPO, you will likely have to aim for $100m+ in ARR though.
The tricky part for investors of course, is to determine which of these categories a SaaS company falls into. This proves particularly difficult in the early stages, when all movements are still quite similar (see left box in the graph). While the relative movement (or momentum) to get to $30k for instance can be an indicator for feature or product/market fit and good execution, it doesn’t reveal too much about when we will hit the ceiling. As the company grows and more data becomes available, this gets easier, but it will still depend on the eye of the investor at the end of the day. That’s why having a more accurate sense for how big a company can get gives savvy growth investors a big advantage vs their peers — if they are right. :-)
How low high can you go?
Alas, there is never a silver bullet, but here are some data points that can help you to assess what kind of company you are looking at (and please feel free to add to the list):
I usually try to get an answer to most of these questions to come up with i) a more conservative estimate of where the ceiling could be (i.e ‘the baseline scenario’) and ii) a more optimistic one that factors in optionality (i.e ‘the breakout case’). Ideally, the baseline scenario already satisfies your investment strategy and the optionality scenario can then be seen as additional upside and follow on decisions, as more data becomes available.
So, how high can you go?

Defining customer touchpoints, interactions and engagement
It seems every company these days is embracing a customer-centric strategy and talking about optimizing the customer experience. But it’s impossible to do either of those without truly understanding everything that the customer experience encompasses.
When most people talk about customer experience, they think about customer service, customer satisfaction, customer success, customer engagement or customer interactions. But customer experience is all of the above plus more, much more.
On the most granular level, customer experience is about each customer’s perception of your company, brand, and product. This perception is based on all the interactions that customer has with your employees, brand, messages, and product across every channel and device. Essentially, every tangible and intangible element associated with your business has potential to shift the customer perception and shape the experience. Customers form this perception by comparing their actual experience with their expectations.
You might be thinking this is a bunch of marketing gibberish and buzzwords all rolled up in a few sentences. However, it’s critical for us as business professionals to establish definitions of important terms and concepts. Otherwise, discussions around basic marketing strategy can lead to a dead-end, with parties talking past each other because of conflicting definitions and terms.
Over the last few months, Aptrinsic founders (Nick Bonfiglio and Mickey Alon) and I wrote a book on how SaaS companies can deliver more a personalized product experience with a product-led go-to-market strategy. Part of this process was establishing concrete definitions of concepts since business terminology is filled with buzzwords and jargon. We researched and analyzed hundreds of articles, resources, and over two dozens of books and spent a fair share of time debating every concept we cover in the book. We quickly realized that the reason for most disagreements was the fact that we held different concepts and ideas about common terms.
What was especially striking was the realization that definitions of even the most common industry terms can be completely different. That’s when we realized that it helps to establish common terminology and define even the most obvious concepts.
Defining customer experience was the first step.
Customer experience (CX) is a perception a customer has about a company based on all touchpoints, interactions, and engagements with the company, its brand, and its product.
Naturally, the question surfaces: What do you mean by touchpoints, interactions, and engagement? Touchpoint is often defined as an interaction and interaction is often used interchangeably with engagement. But there’s a difference.
Let’s try to sort this out with an example. While driving on a highway, you notice a large billboard with a clever ad. Regardless of whether you formed any opinion about the ad, the message registered either in your conscious or unconscious mind. Is this an interaction? Hardly, since interaction is defined as reciprocal action between two or more parties. But you were exposed to a billboard ad, and that exposure can be best described as a touchpoint.
Touchpoint is a single moment when a customer comes in contact with (or is exposed to) a company’s brand, product, employees or message through any channel or device.
This is the same as wandering around a clothing store and looking at the products for sale. Even if you don’t try on or buy anything, you’ve been exposed to the brand. That’s a touchpoint. Touchpoint is any exposure a customer has with your company, regardless whether it was seeing your message, such as on a billboard, or being exposed to your product or brand.
Customer interaction is a two-way communication process between a customer and a company’s brand or product.
The confusion starts when you think about how an interaction is different from customer engagement. In the marketing world, customer engagement and customer interaction are practically the same. And in my opinion, it shouldn’t be this way. While interaction is a two-way communication process, engagement is a commitment or agreement to act.
Customer engagement is a commitment or agreement of a customer to act.
Again, let’s use an analogy. Think about an engagement that signifies a formal agreement to get married. In that case, engagement is commitment to action. Similarly, rules of engagement in the military are the directives that define when action or use of force may be applied. Here too, engagement is a commitment to act or is characterized the action itself. When it comes to how buyers engage with software companies, aside from buying a product, signing up for a free trial is an engagement since the buyer is showing some committed to action.
Every interaction is a touchpoint, but not every touchpoint is an interaction. Every customer engagement is an interaction, but not every interaction is an engagement.
When a customer walks into a store and gets exposed to products and brand messages, that’s a touchpoint.
When a customer picks up a Nike shoe to feel the material or talks to the salesperson in the store, he or she is interacting with the product or sales rep.
When a customer wants to try on shoes, he or she is engaging with a brand — that’s customer engagement. Actually purchasing those shoes is the ultimate customer engagement.
All customer touchpoints, interactions, and engagement combine for an overall customer experience with — and perception of — a company.
These concepts are applicable to SaaS and software-first companies. Designing and delivering a great customer experience in the enterprise software (B2B) industry is difficult. In SaaS, the buying process involves multiple stakeholders, with decisions often spread across multiple individuals or even departments. This make it difficult to evaluate and optimize the customer experience across the whole customer lifecycle which includes multiple journeys, touchpoints, and interactions. Understanding the end-to-end customer lifecycle requires not only a analyzing individual touchpoints, interactions, and engagements between customers and the organization, but also evaluating the customer experience as a whole.
For SaaS companies, the following are possible customer touchpoints, interactions and engagements:
In a world where Amazon, Uber and other pioneering companies have set the standard for customer experience, it becomes increasingly important for every company to excel at it. With so much noise, it’s often difficult to differentiate what we mean by the terms we use. Breaking down concepts and defining even common terms can help us all get to the core. When companies evaluate their customer experiences with the goal of optimizing them, it’s useful to know what combination of touchpoints, interactions, and engagement are part of those experiences.

Creating a successful software as a service (SaaS) product is the dream for many entrepreneurial-minded programmers. In the process of launching my own SaaS I discovered that sharing and comparing experiences with other founders is an essential part of this journey, and without this, I probably would never have created it at all.
In this article, I’ll share the mental and practical processes that led me to create a SaaS product from scratch, and how I gained my first paying customers. Whether you are thinking about creating a new product or you have already launched, this article can help you compare your own strategies and methods with the ones that worked for me, and possibly adapt them for yourself.
I personally dedicate up to five hours per week researching the experiences of other founders. I’m always looking for new ideas, ways to avoid mistakes, and evaluating new strategies that could help me to obtain concrete results (that is, improve the product and increase customers’ happiness).
For this reason, I decided to work in a completely frank and transparent way and share everything about my path — including what has been working and what has not — with the aim of helping one another through direct and rational discussion.
The article is divided into seven chronological sections, following every phase of the work I have done:
The SaaS product I built is Inspector, a real-time monitoring tool that helps software developers to avoid losing customers and money due to technical problems in their applications.
Spending the last 10 years working with software development teams made me realize how complicated it is for developers to handle technical problems that affect applications every day. Development teams have close relationships with their customers, and this is a high risk for companies that produce software because with problems you realize how fragile this bond really is.
Users do not like problems! It seems obvious, but this aspect is constantly underestimated. This is an uncomfortable truth. No one likes to be in trouble, and it is instinctive to minimize the problem. But by denying this reality you could annoy the customer even more, to the point where they may even reconsider whether or not they “should” even pay you.
Customers do not spend their time reporting problems and application errors. No one cares about helping us resolve bugs. They just leave our application, and it may be years before we see them again. Despite this, every team I have worked with used the best-known method of figuring out whether applications were working properly or not:
“If an angry customers calls you, the software is not working.”
It is not exactly a technological solution…
Maybe it seems ridiculous, but beyond the perception tycoons of technology project on our jobs, insiders know that urgency, limited budget, pressing customers, managers, forcing developers to constantly work under pressure, and adopting Band-Aid solutions (to temporarily fix a problem), are survival strategies. Working this approach for 10 years helped me realize there is clearly a problem here.
At the beginning of 2019, I had just finished some important projects and was expecting to enjoy a little period of calmness. During the last few years, I have used such moments to look for business opportunities which allow me to put my technical skills to good use with the hope of finding the right conditions to launch my own business idea.
I knew from my experience as a developer that an easy and immediate monitoring instrument would be enough to help development teams to stay up-to-date about the performance of applications, instead of relying on customer calls to know when the software was creating problems. On the other hand, I did not need a tool to monitor everything, as everything often means nothing. And I didn’t want it to be complicated — I did not want to spend a month learning how it worked or need to hire expert engineers just for this job. My life had to be made easier than before. It was necessary to have a ready-to-go developer tool.
The first step was to understand if there already were solutions trying to solve this problem, so I googled “application monitoring” and 941,000,000 results appeared:
Wow. That’s a very huge amount of content for a problem that probably is huge. But how huge, exactly?
Software development team inefficiency is a problem I have always faced directly, but there is a big difference between estimating a job task and quantifying the economic impact of a problem. It is even more difficult on a large scale. This tweet captured my attention:
50% of developers admit to spending up to 50% of their time verifying that applications are working.
Software development is work mostly paid by the time technicians spend working on a project, and if there are periods in which developers spend 50 percent of their time checking that everything is okay, a tool whichcompletely automates this job could be useful enough to buy.
So why aren’t they so common to so many developers?
I thought about the two main parameters a company looks at when it has to decide which tools to use to increase productivity:
Using these parameters, I spent about a week creating an evaluation sheet of the most well-known monitoring instruments and I placed them in a graphic:
After days of putting information together, a look at the graphic was enough to realize where the problem was. Easy instruments do not provide enough value to the majority of developers. More complete instruments, instead, are thought of as being for big organizations and requiring skilled staff who dedicate themselves to their installation, configuration, and use, which ends up complicating team operations rather than simplifying them.
In my vision, the problem is not the monitoring itself but the development of team efficiency.
For a massive adoption, it would be necessary to have a product that requires a minute for the installation, no configurations, and, at the same time, that provides complete and easy information to consult that would allow even medium-sized development teams to fix the real-time monitoring problem.
And of course, it has to be cool.
Finally, I decided to try it. The last work experience had gone well and I thought that it would not be impossible for me to create this tool. So, I immediately informed my partners that I wanted to build an MVP for the following two or three months. When I explained it to them, it was hard to make them understand the problem because they are not technicians involved at the same level I am. They gave me the okay based 90 percent on trust, and I thank them for this.
Over the course of three months I was able to create this prototype:
While working on the implementation, I gradually understood the problems of realizing this kind of tool and even problems users would encounter during its use. From a technical point of view, a monitoring product has to be designed to work with huge quantities of data and I also wanted to deal with these data in real-time.
I had to spend longer than I predicted for the backend part — in other words, the part which cannot be seen, or the backstage of an in-cloud software — leaving out the graphic interface (as you can see above), which is the part users see and use.
In the last few years, the dream of launching a product on the market pushed me to constantly study and apply marketing strategies that are particularly adept for SaaS software, to different projects (even the failed ones). I started to write articles for my blog with the aim of publishing them on different websites and social media to collect the first feedback.
Although I wrote horrible content in English with writing mistakes because English is not my mother tongue, I started to receive feedback on my idea which included:
It was not easy to be objective while looking at developers’ responses and comments. The emotional reaction could always take over and it was really hard for me to understand where the mistakes were because I am not a sales agent or a seller, but I am a damn good technician.
Thanks to my technical skills on the matter, I did not need to sell. Rather, I just needed to learn how to communicate the problems I faced every day and how I fixed them with my tools.
I spent an entire month writing the most important things I knew about the monitoring and application scalability problems and the reasons why I decided to start this project, the difficulties I had been encountering during the development of a product, how I fixed them and moved forward,code examples, technical guides, my best practices, and more.
Then I gave everything to Robin, a Canadian copywriter found on Fiverr, who corrected all the content, including the website text, and polished the writing into native-level English.
The fear of leaving out the user interface turned out to be a well-founded fear. What I did was not enough to create the kind of experience I had in my head, so I had to start again. The advantage of this was that I fixed the majority of the technical problems. It is not easy for an engineer to put themselves in a designer’s shoes.
To improve my design sense I attended two courses about the development of graphic interfaces, read three books on design and user experience, and made direct experiments using VueJs as frontend framework.
When we spend our time reading books and watching videos on marketing and business, we always learn common advice which, in practical situations, usually does not work. Consider, for example, the mantra: “If you wait until everything is ready, you will never start your business”. So true!
But first experiences push us to emotional reactions that can put us on the defensive. This is a very big mistake because creating a product that is worthy of being bought thanks to its utility is a process, not a single event. The word “launch” misleads us, so forget about it and concentrate on “creation,” the process which, step by step, helps you understand what you need to change and improve to achieve your aim, compared with the outside world.
It took me another two months of working on the project; during these months I decided to recreate the brand from scratch, trying to use the prototype experience not just in terms of product but also in terms of marketing and communication.
Inspector — Identify issues in your code before users are aware of them, in less than one minute!
We endlessly repeated ourselves that the aim was not the monitoring itself, but to help developers automate their working processes:
On July 14, 2019, one of my technical guides was approved to be published on Laravel News, one of the most important websites for the Laravel developers’ community, which got the word out about this tool to an extended audience. Within four days, more than 2,000 people visited the Inspector website, almost 100 companies signed up, and the two first users — from Holland and Switzerland — subscribed.
I cannot describe the emotion I felt when I received my first notice from Stripe which informed me that I had just received my first payment. When it happened, it was late in the evening. It felt like I was carrying an elephant on my shoulders for seven months and, finally, it went away and let mebreathe.
A lot of problems cropped up during the following months, and they required time, effort, and money to be fixed. This included things like hacking attacks and overloaded infrastructures, problems that forced me to stay chained to the PC even on Christmas Eve. These are problems that send you crashing back to earth and make you realize things are even more difficult than before because you have something to lose now.
With the first subscribers, I knew I had an interesting product and, thanks to the web and the cloud, I had the chance to make the product known to developers from all over the world. So I kept working hard, full-time, every day for months to create and publish technical articles from myexperience on as many channels as possible:
Now, more than 800 companies and business people have tried Inspector and we have more than 20 active subscriptions now from Singapore, Germany, NewYork, France, Hong Kong, Holland, and more.
Sharing and comparing with others has been fundamental in my journey to get here, so I plan to keep going this way. After all, I’m aware there are still a lot of things we need to improve and, even worse, problems that at the moment we’re ignoring entirely. This is why we started to tell this story during the most important Italian events where the topic is innovation.
Now we are part of the Hubble program, the Italian startup accelerator made by Paolo Barberis, Jacopo Marello, and Alessandro Sordi; three of Dada’s founders who spent 20 years of their lives collaborating to finance and support more than 30 Italian and foreign companies in growth.
Our aim is to introduce ourselves to other managers, business people, and marketing and technology experts in order to elevate the product to the next level and test new instruments and strategies to get Inspector known all over the world. We would like to help software developers to work in a more productive and fun way thanks to smart tools which give them more free time to spend on more valuable activities instead of boring, repetitive, manual checks.
In this article, I’ve shared the mental and practical process that led me to create and launch a SaaS product from scratch, and how I gained my first paying customers. Without sharing my journey I would never have created Inspector, so thank you for reading this article and I invite you to leave a comment below with any questions, curiosities, or just to tell me what you think about it. And if you think this article could be useful to others, please share it on your social media!

(Originally published on SaaStr — more on that here.)
So as a founder, I was fired by 3 PR firms. In a row. Two actual PR firms, and the third, a solo shop.
I was fired for one simple reason: I demanded results.
First, I demanded we actually measure PR. That we score the PR hits each month, graded both on quality of the hit, as well as the prominence of my company in the piece.
And second, I demanded we have a goal to Do Better. To drive that score up.
The first PR firm fired me for asking for measuring results. The second PR firm fired me for asking us to drive it up (the score), as it went down. And the third fired me because they wanted credit for low-scoring PR that I got myself (not them).
Anyhow I’ve learned a lot since then. I’ve also worked closely with Ed Zitron of EZPR.com who I highly recommend. He didn’t fire me. :)
He’s worked with many of my portfolio companies and acts as our informal PR-Guru-in-Residence at SaaStr.
I thought I’d summarize a few learnings.
Ok so then — Why PR?
Well …
So PR is important. Do it.
Just don’t do crappy PR:
Do any event, get on stage, where you can speak to 50+ high quality folks. This always pays off, at least for me.
Don’t hire a crappy PR firm and do a lot of work with them getting into 4th tier media. It’s not the end of the world, but as CEO, it’s not a good use of your time.
Do fire any PR firm that doesn’t deliver results in the first 60–90 days. The best ones all have a ringer, a journalist that will do them a favor. If 60 days in, you don’t see results. You never will.
Do what feels authentic and right to you. Do you like to speak? Focus on that. Do you like to write? Focus there. Do what’s natural for you. Later, do what’s unnatural. After $5m ARR or so.
And whatever you do, measure it. Have reasonable, achievable expectations. Don’t let PR just be a cost center line item in your VPM’s budget.
And if it ain’t working … make a change.

Top highlight
By nihal mehta with guest author Dannie Herzberg, Head of Mid-Market Sales at Slack
As an early-stage VC fund, one of our driving factors is to invest in startups with technical founders, and while the founders may have deep knowledge of computer science or a rich history building products, often experience in sales, especially enterprise sales, is limited to none. As their biggest champions, we do our best to provide them with the support they need, often introducing them to subject matter experts in our network who can offer direct, hands-on help as well.
We partnered with our friends at Emergence Capital for an event to address the many challenges navigating early-stage growth including when to make your first sales hire, how to qualify leads all the way to determining pricing structure.
We were lucky enough to snag Dannie Herzberg, Head of Mid-Market Sales at Slack, as our guest speaker. Her impressive background, overseeing Mid-Market, BDR & SDR sales organizations across North America and working across enterprise sales, sales management, and channel sales divisions, made her an excellent source for advice.
Dannie was kind enough to help bring the evening’s top questions back to life to share with the rest of our community.
1. First sales hire- who and when?
Dannie: The first sales hire is you! As the founder, no one knows the company, the technology and the product better than you do.
Once you are ready for your first sales rep, you don’t necessarily need the traditional sales hire. The #1 enterprise sales rep at Oracle is unlikely to be the best first sales hire for your early-stage SaaS company. Such a person is sure to be a great hunter and closer, but they may not have some of the key traits necessary for your first few sales hires.
Instead, look for someone who thrives in ambiguity, demonstrates insatiable curiosity, and loves spending time getting to know customers. Ideally, this person is equally enthused by on gathering, synthesizing and relaying feedback from frontlines to the product team as she is about the thrill of closing deals.
Nihal: Founders sell almost exclusively until the Series A. Need the shortest possible feedback loop from customer to founder to iterate on product/market/ fit the fastest.
2. How much do we charge?
Dannie: Pricing strategy should vary depending on the market you address. If selling to SMBs and incorporating any level of freemium in your model, then a transparent pricing strategy that’s listed on your website is the way to go. If you’re selling primarily to enterprise buyers, then some version of “contact us” call-to-action is typical practice, as there are too many factors (beyond budget) that you’ll need to consider before recommending the appropriate product SKU and potential services package. If you’re selling something to both audiences, you can incorporate both strategies.
Nihal: For ‘whales,’ charge as much as you can. *wink*
3. How do we sell into the R&D buyer?
Dannie: The R&D buyer is technical by nature and likely has an aversion to salespeople and sales pitches. The goal of all product sales is to meet the buyer where she is and insert human outreach only if or when it becomes instrumental and helpful. For R&D, the more you can allow the product to do the selling, the better the buyer’s experience will be and the more discipline you’ll incorporate into your product growth strategy. To learn from a company that has mastered this discipline, watch this great talk by Jay Simons from Atlassian.
4. How do we convert pilots to annual recurring contracts?
Dannie: Pilots are a very tempting place to start, but seller beware: drawing boundaries is a must. First, figure out what value can (or can’t) be evaluated during the pilot and what questions can’t be answered without a pilot. Second, determine who will be running pilot, how they measure success and if they’ll be running simultaneous pilots. After all of this, if you still end up running a pilot, make sure you learn about the buying process that would take place if and when the pilot is a success. Agree upon the price and plan for success in advance so that a successful pilot can immediately parlay into a full-blown contract.
Nihal: Auto-convert pilots to annual recurring contracts from the beginning in the pilot contract. Also, another strategy that seems to be working (h/t Villi Iltchev), is to eliminate pilots entirely and instead offer a 90-day out.
5. What are some bottoms up sales strategies that work well?
Dannie: Emphasize creating value versus extracting value. With that lens, a great bottoms-up sales strategy is to connect with individual end-users of a product to understand how they use it. Seek to understand how it helps their day-to-day, what additional challenges they run into and the potential benefits if more people at their company were using the product.
Next, synthesize what you learn in these user-interviews to an exec-level buyer. This way, you are essentially teaching her about what’s happening in the organization that she isn’t aware of, and it should earn you a meeting.
Product usage and engagement data is your best guide for determining how to use your time wisely. Remember, you’re aiming to help people exactly when they need it, so identify point-in-time notifications, such as an alert when someone new swipes their credit card or an alert when a team has crossed a particular threshold that would require them to use a different SKU of the product.
Nihal: What Dannie said!
We hope these Q&A’s were helpful for you, and thank you, Dannie, so much for all your support!

If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
We previously wrote about hunting animals and the three SaaS sales models. If you are hesitating on the animal you should hunt or on the sales model you should adopt here are three checklists that will help you. If for a given checklist you answer a majority of “yes” to the questions it means that your SaaS is compatible with this sales model.
As usual don’t hesitate to let your comment / questions in the comment section.
The self-serve sales model requires a frictionless product coupled with a high volume, high velocity and low cost lead generation engine (since Annual Contract Value, ACV, here is typically between $1 — $1k). “Low touch sales” SaaS are very much focused on optimizing every step of the customer journey, from visit to signup, signup to trial and trial to pay, in order to automate it as much as possible. In that perspective it’s almost impossible to build such a company, at scale, without a strong viral loop (a “powered by” or outstanding word of mouth).
The transactional model is an hybrid one as it requires a high volume, high velocity lead generation engine, but you can spend more on acquisition thanks to an higher ACV (typically >$3K), complemented by an inside sales team that will do product demos and close deals. Products with a high revenue expansion potential (= when a customer is likely to pay more and more over time) are a good fit as account expansion generally requires proactive account management (from customer success to account manager) which can be financially supported by this model.
The enterprise model is characterized by very long sales cycles requiring an enterprise grade product, from features to SLAs and security guarantee, and extremely strong (and costly) customer support. The vast majority of SaaS founders won’t start with this model and won’t even think about it.

In our weekly investment team call earlier this week we decided to pass on two early-stage SaaS startups that were both on track to grow from zero to $100k in MRR in their first 12 months of going live. Both companies clearly had impressive traction, but in both cases we weren’t convinced of the market size and the opportunity to build a large, sustainable company. (We of course might be wrong, and maybe we’ll have to add both companies to our growing anti-portfolio list in a couple of years. I’ll keep you posted.)
Had I seen a SaaS startup with this growth curve in my first 2–3 years of SaaS investing (in 2008–2010) I probably would have asked “where do I have to sign?”. And chances are that it would have been a good investment. The reason is that at that time, growing from zero to $100k in MRR within 12 months was extremely rare and an indication of not only a great product and excellent execution but also a great market opportunity.
One could argue that I saw much fewer deals in general at that time and that, being an angel investor, I had lower ambitions than a VC. That’s true. But it’s only part of the picture. The other part is that even as recently as 6–24 months ago, we’d consider a SaaS startup with this growth pattern exceptional. Passing on fast-growing SaaS companies that are clearly successful and on to something is a pretty new and somewhat scary experience for us.
The driver behind this development is what my colleague Clément Vouillon has described as “The Rise of Non ‘VC compatible’ SaaS Companies”, that is the fact that compared to some years ago there are now many more SaaS companies that get to $1M, $5M, maybe even $10M in ARR. Arguably, there’s never been a better time to start a SaaS company. A much larger and more educated market, combined with vastly lower costs to create software, means that your chances of building a viable SaaS company have never been higher.
For VCs, the question is how many of these companies can become large enough to make the (admittedly somewhat weird) business model of venture capitalists work. Large VCs need multiple unicorns just to survive. In SaaS, that means companies that get to $100M in ARR and keep growing fast beyond that mark. With a ~$60M fund, we at Point Nine may not need unicorns to survive, but we won’t generate a great return if we don’t have exits north of $100M either. And as much as I agree with this post on TechCrunch today when it says that starting and selling a company for $100 million dollars is an outlier event in terms of pure entrepreneurial probability, a big part of my daily motivation is to find some of these truly iconic companies that become much larger. I guess once you’ve seen it once (in my case with Zendesk) you get addicted and want to do it again. :-)
We’ve come too farTo give up who we areSo let’s raise the barAnd our cups to the stars
Daft Punk, Get Lucky
(I’m not sure if I understand the meaning of these lines in the context of the song, but I love the song and had to think of these lines while writing this post.)
Coming back to our observation regarding the rise of bootstrapped SaaS companies, assuming our theory is right, it means two things:
1) We’ll have to raise the bar even further
There will be more and more SaaS companies that, based on the “pattern recognition” that we’ve developed in the last years, we’d like to invest in but will have to pass on. We can only make 10–15 new investments per year and we’re obviously trying to find the very best ones — the outliers among the outliers, if you will.
2) Picking might become even harder
If it’s true that there are indeed more SaaS companies that quickly grow to $1–2M in ARR but that increase is not matched by a similar increase of companies that become very large, picking the right investments will become even harder. To keep up with that challenge we’ll have to constantly ask ourselves if we’re still asking the right questions when we assess a potential investment.
What does it mean for SaaS founders? First of all, as mentioned above, we might live in the best time to start a new SaaS company that ever existed. Second, founders should ask themselves what kind of company they aspire to build and should only try to raise venture capital if they are convinced that they want to build what Clément called the “VC compatible” startup (check out his post for a little checklist). As Clément said, this is not about good or bad. The VC path is not better than the bootstrapping path. In fact, for the majority of SaaS startups it’s probably not the right one.
Not yet convinced that you shouldn’t raise venture capital? :) Let us know!

We knew it was ambitious to rebuild our software from the ground up, but we weren’t prepared for the mountainous endeavour it turned into. A year and a half later, we ended up with an overall better user interface and back-end infrastructure, but it came at the price of worn out developers, stressed support staff, and frustrated customers. First, let me tell you the reason behind the decision to rebuild.
Technology changes fast, and it’s important that you keep your tech stack up-to-date. No developers want to work with outdated frameworks, archaic languages, or code crippled by legacy issues.
Proposify’s CTO, Jonathan Down, launched our minimal viable product (MVP) in 2013, and as we rapidly iterated based on feedback, he quickly realized he needed to rebuild the product. When building an MVP you sacrifice stability and scalability in favour of rapid learning. Proposify 1 was born, and by late 2014, we began hitting product-market fit.
In 2016, after a couple years of rapid growth, I began working on a completely revamped editor based on customer feedback.
The new editor design was many times better than what we had in terms of usability. But it would require a substantial amount of work to re-build. And there were other reasons we opted for a ground-up rewrite:
All tech companies rewrite their products at different stages of their lifecycle. The Facebook we’re using today isn’t the Facebook that Zuckerberg built in his Harvard dorm. Plus, I felt since technology changes so substantially every five years, rewriting the software was a smart decision.
As CEO, I had the final say in whether or not we’d rebuild, and to me it seemed clear that this was the best path forward. Because we had already rebuilt the product before, I expected it would be a similar experience as last time. I was wrong.
Jonathan did some preliminary work, and in the summer of 2016, he let the developers get to work on 2. They really had to take every single thing we did in the past two years, rip it apart, and rewrite it line-by-line.
We only had a few developers, so it took a long time. I was naïve enough to believe that we were talking maybe three or four months, but after six months had passed, there was still no end in sight. To help speed things up, we stalled work on Proposify 1 to put all of our development firepower into 2.
Our scheduled completion dates came and went, but there was just no way to make people work any faster. We were in development hell. Once we had come so far, we felt like we were at the point of no return (queue sunk cost fallacy). Over that time we hired more developers, and didn’t want to teach them the old codebase we would eventually be replacing.
There were no easy answers. We just needed to soldier on. No matter how long it took, we needed to figure out how to get it done. Day in, day out, it was just putting another brick on a wall we couldn’t see the end of.
We felt the pressure every day as customers demanded features and bug fixes in Proposify 1 and we had to reassure them it would be fixed in Proposify 2. During that year-and-a-half period, we had some disappointed customers who wanted us to solve their problems now, not wait indefinitely.
Key lesson learned during that time: If you’re working on a major revamp of your product, don’t allow your sales and support team to use the new product as a catch-all solution. The natural inclination when a customer is upset or disappointed is to oversell the revamp, making them think everything will be perfect when it launches. As you’ll find out later in this article, it still won’t be. Instead, train them how to solve customers problems in the meantime.
When I realized that Proposify 2 had no end in sight, I made the decision to pull a couple developers off to work on new features so we could show our customers that we are still relevant and adding value to keep up with market demands. That would mean we would need to rebuild these features in Proposify 2, but we needed a short term win even if that meant more work down the road.
The first feature was Streams, a simple feature that lets you create multiple pipelines for different types of sales documents, like proposals, quotes, and contracts.
The second was Stripe integration, so you can accept partial or full payments from your clients when they accept your proposal.
It definitely helped us keep more than a few customers happy, but it wasn’t enough—we needed to get Proposify 2 finished.
In late 2017 we were ready to begin getting some customers into the product, but we faced a new challenge, one we hadn’t even thought much about—how do we actually roll it out to our ~5,000 paying accounts?
All along, our initial plan for launching Proposify 2 was to take the site down and switch all of our customers over right away during a weekend migration when most customers wouldn’t be using the product.
Luckily, one our board members, Ben Yoskovitz, has a lot of experience leading product teams and warned us against it (I don’t want to even think about the irreparable damage that could have been done if we had pulled the bandaid off too quickly).
Here’s how we did it:
Ben and Jonathan had the idea to build the app on two different domains, and to come up with a migration plan to gradually move people over to Proposify 2 on an account-by-account basis.
In November 2017, we began our migration plan by starting a small percentage of new free trials on 2 instead of the 1.
We used Visual Website Optimizer (VWO) to run the split test. This allowed us to make it so a random percentage of traffic who click the sign-up button are sent to the original sign-up page for Proposify 1 (.biz) and the other percentage goes to the new sign-up page for Proposify 2 (.com).
We only started with about 5% of new clicks going into the test because we wanted to measure the usage and ensure the product was working.
By January, some of those started turning into paid accounts. So every few weeks, I would tweak the percentage, and go a little bit higher so more people were getting sent to the new version. As we started getting volume into it, we started getting feedback from new users and bug reports started coming in. Luckily, our trial-to-paid conversion was closely on par with Proposify 1, so by February 2017, I dialled it up to 100%—now every user signing up for a trial was going to 2.
Now, our longstanding customers were on Proposify 1 while new customers, leads, and trials were on Proposify 2. This drained support, many of whom were new employees and had to learn the nuances between the two products and know which product a customer was using and how best to help them.
We had new features and fixes in Proposify 2 that our customers were begging for (like custom fields/variables) but we couldn’t give it to them until they migrated over. Jonathan had to come up with a sensible way to move customers over in a way that didn’t break their account or cause any issues with outstanding proposals getting signed.
First, we had to figure out technically how to migrate all of our customers’ data over into Proposify 2, which was challenging because the data is structured differently than 1. We couldn’t just turn the whole product off for a weekend to migrate data.
Jonathan came up with the solution to add the new tables within the original database. So people who were in Proposify 1 would be sharing the exact same database as people on 2, but some of their data would be in a different table structure. To migrate an account a process would need to run that would convert all of their proposals, and the elements that make up those proposals (text boxes, videos, images, fees, etc.) to the new table structure.
We still didn’t want to switch all past customers over to Proposify 2 as it presented a huge risk—we had to do it on an account by account basis.
On April 10th, 2018 we officially announced Proposify 2. To get it an account owner would need to log into his or her account, and click on the “Get Proposify 2” button. Once they clicked it, they would enter a queue, and when it was their turn, their account at Proposify 1 (.biz) would be frozen and their data would begin migrating over. When it was finished, usually after a few minutes, they would be redirected to their new account over at Proposify 2 (.com).
New lesson learned: We didn’t allow our largest tier of customers to self-migrate. We hid the button from them so that our customer success team could coordinate it with them personally, and make sure it was a smooth transition. Our heart was in the right place, but we didn’t communicate it properly and a lot of our biggest customers emailed support asking why they couldn’t see the button in their account.
The pain was far from over. We uncovered a lot of problems when we started mass migrating accounts.
We later learned some customers had developed their own hacks to use our fee tables in Proposify 1, so a lot of frustration came from those tables not porting over to Proposify 2 properly. In some cases, their proposal designs got obliterated.
For months afterward, we needed to dedicate all of our development, QA, and customer support resources to fixing migration issues, squashing bugs, and helping calm upset customers.
Our net promoter score (NPS) — how we generally measure product satisfaction among customers — took a major hit because of issues with Proposify 2.
Key lessons learned:
We dedicated all of Q2 to just fixing Proposify 2 bugs. It was painful to slow down again on feature development, especially since we had waited so long to be in the place where we could work on new features. But it was even more painful to have disappointed our customers and created frustration for them rather than solving it.
We’re now mostly through the weeds. All of our customers have been migrated over and the major issues have been fixed. There’s still have a large backlog of bugs to fix, but we did end up with a more user-friendly interface, some highly requested features, and a scalable technological foundation to build upon.
More recently we’ve gotten through some of our growing pains around hiring and on-boarding new developers and running sprints. We’ve shipped image editing, integration with Unsplash, a new Android mobile app, deep integration with Salesforce on the AppExchange, and the ability to have multiple signatures and initials per signer. Some other really exciting updates are currently being developed.
No. I’m glad it’s done, but the path to get there was risky and painful.
Hindsight is 20/20, but I think it was premature to rewrite our product. We were just beginning to get major traction and growth in 2016, and we should have capitalized on that opportunity. Instead, we took our eye off the ball and lost some momentum (Not to say we didn’t grow—We saw 113% growth in ARR during 2017 despite only launching two noteworthy features).
If you raised significant capital and have a large team (>100 employees), a case could be made to rewrite. But I would only do it if I had the resources to support both products at the same time. It would mean a lot of wasted money, but I’d go in with eyes wide open instead of being stuck in an impossible situation like this again in the future.
It’s taken a long time to be able to write this article, mostly because the pain was still too near. But I hope it helps you if you’re wrestling with the decision to rewrite your software.
Enjoyed this article I’d appreciate you giving it some claps. Also sign up to get my book, Free Trials (& Tribulations): How To Build A Business While Getting Punched In The Mouth when it launches in January 2019.

Bir süredir yan proje olarak bir SAAS yazılımı geliştiriyoruz. Projeyi bitirdikten sonra bir blog serisi olarak baştan sona karşılaştığımız problemleri ve çözümlerini kaynak kodu da paylaşarak anlatmayı düşünüyoruz.
Proje multi-tenant bir SAAS yazılımı olduğu için platformda hesap oluşturan her bir müşteriye benzersiz bir sub-domain tahsis ediliyor. Örnek olarak; diyelim ki platformumuz example.com domaini üzerinde host ediliyor. Bir kullanıcı x isminde bir hesap oluşturduğunda kendi platformuna erişim için x.example.com şeklinde bir domaine sahip oluyor. Bu problemin çözümünü bir örnek ile buradaki yazımda anlatmıştım.
Bu problemin üstesinden geldikten sonra karşımızda çözmemiz gereken yeni bir problem vardı: Kullanıcılar platformlarına erişim için kendilerine ait bir custom domaini kullanabilmeliydiler. Birkaç günlük araştırma ve kodlamanın ardından custom domain desteğinin geliştirmesini tamamladık. Bu makalede de çözümü dilim döndüğünce anlatmaya çalışacağım. Umarım faydalı olur.
Önce geliştirmek istediğimiz özelliği daha iyi anlayabilmemiz için problemimizi örnek bir kullanıcı hikayesi ile açıklamaya çalışalım: Platformumuzu kullanan Ali isminde bir kullanıcı var. Ali xyz.com isminde bir domaine sahip. Bizim SAAS blog platformumuzu kullanarak kendisine bir blog oluşturdu. Platformun kendisine tahsis ettiği otomatik oluşturulan domaini kullanmak yerine kendisine ait olan xyz.com domainini kullanmak istiyor. Bunun için platformun sağladığı dashboard paneli üzerinden custom domani girip kaydetti. Ardından domainini satın aldığı platforma giderek, xyz.com domaini için bizim ona verdiğimiz ip adresini işaret eden bir A record oluşturup yönlendirme işlemini tamamladı.
Bu işlemden sonra kullanıcımız xyz.com adresine istek gönderdikten sonra bizim platformumuza yönlenecek ve biz de ona ait olan içeriği domaine göre veritabanından çekip göstereceğiz. Çözmek istediğimiz ilk problem bu. Fakat başka bir problememiz daha var.
Platformumuzdaki trafiğin SSL üzerinden ilerlemesini istiyoruz. Sistem tarafından onlara tahsis edilen benzersiz subdomainler zaten full SSL desteğine sahip ve buradaki yazıda bunun nasıl yapıldığını anlatmıştık. Fakat bu problemimiz biraz daha farklı. Kullanıcılar kendi domainlerini kullanacaklar ve domainleri bizim sunucumuza yönlenecek. Platformumuza yönlenen bu domainler için SSL desteğini nasıl sağlayabiliriz?
Kullanıcılar kendi domainleri üzerinden platformumuza istek gönderdiklerinde gelen ilk istekte otomatik olarak SSL sertifikasını oluşturup, ondan sonra gelecek olan tüm istekler için bu sertifikayı kullanacağız. Böylelikle kullanıcılarımız girdikleri custom domainler için SSL desteğine kavuşacak.
Çözeceğimiz problemlerin kafamızda netleştiğini düşünüyorum. O yüzden şimdi çözüm kısmına geçelim.
Custom domainlerden gelen isteklerde otomatik olarak SSL sertifikasını oluşturmak istediğimiz için bunu destekleyen bir yapıya ihtiyacımız var. Biz SAAS yazılımımızı linux üzerinde host ediyoruz. Go programlama dili ile yazılan web uygulamasına gelen istekleri ilk olarak nginx karşılıyor ve bir reverse proxy görevi görerek istekleri docker üzerinde çalışan Go uygulamasına yönlendiriyor.
Kullanıcılar hesap oluşturduktan sonra otomatik oluşturulup onlara tahsis edilen subdomainler için Let’s Encrypt kullanarak bir wildcard SSL sertifikası oluşturmuştuk ve böylelikle tüm subdomainler için SSL desteği sağlayabiliyorduk. Fakat burada custom domainlere SSL desteği vermek istediğimiz için biraz daha farklı bir yaklaşıma ihtiyacımız var. Bildiğim kadarı ile nginx’in böyle bir desteği yok. O yüzden bu problemi çözmemizi sağlayan çözümleri araştırmamız gerekiyor.
Biraz araştırdıktan sonra karşıma OpenResty isminde bir web platformu çıktı. Daha önce hiç duymamıştım fakat hakkında biraz okuduktan sonra oldukça popüler bir platform olduğunu gördüm. OpenResty içerisinde Nginx’in core modüllerini barındırıyor ve bunlara ek olarak LuaJIT isminde Lua programlama dili için bir Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) barındırıyor.
Bildiğiniz gibi nginx ile linux üzerinde host ettiğimiz web uygulamalarımızı dış dünyaya servis edebiliyoruz. LuaJIT ile de nginx tarafına gelen isteklerde Lua programlama dili ile yazılmış scriptleri çalıştırıp gelen isteklere göre istediğimiz spesifik işleri yapabiliyoruz. Yani SAAS platformumuza custom domainlerden istek geldiğinde, bu domain için SSL sertifikası üretip üretmeyeceğimizi sorgulayan ve her sorguda dinamik olarak çalışan bir lua scripti yazabiliriz.
Buraya kadar herşey tamam. Fakat netleştirilmesi gereken bir nokta daha var. Diyelim ki gelen custom domain için script kodumuz SSL üretmemiz gerektiğine karar verdi. Peki bu SSL nasıl üretilecek? Bunun için openresty/nginx ikilisine ek olarak let’s encrypt’i kullanan ve otomatik SSL üreten lua-resty-auto-ssl isminde açık kaynak kodlu bir package var. Nginx konfigürasyonumuz bu paketi kullanarak otomatik SSL sertifikaları üretmek için konfigure edilerek, gelen her custom domain için sadece ilk istekte olmak kaydı ile sertifika oluşturulacak.
Biz daha önce web uygulamamızı nginx üzerinden dışarıya acıyorduk. Fakat şimdi OpenResty kullanacağımız için nginx’i kaldırabiliriz. Çünkü OpenResty Nginx ile beraber geliyor. Gerekli konfig dosyalarınızı yedekledikten sonra nginx’i kaldırıp OpenResty’nin kurulumuna geçiyoruz.
Benim linuxte çok fazla tecrübem olmadığından dolayı OpenResty kurulumu için DigitalOcean tutorialından yararlanmıştım. Fakat o tutorial güncelliğini yitirdiğinden midir bilinmez kurulum esnasında bir takım hatalarla karşılaştım. O yüzden burada makaleyi uzatmayı göze alarak OpenResty kurulum kodlarını da paylaşmak istiyorum. Eğer siz OpenResty kurulumunu zaten biliyorsanız bu bölümü atlayıp “OpenResty’i servis haline getirmek” veya “OpenResty/Nginx ikilisinin auto-ssl için konfigure edilmesi” bölümünden devam edebilirsiniz.
Kurulumu tamamlamak için linux sunucunuzda aşağıdaki komutları sırasıyla çalıştırmalısınız. Fazla detaya girmeden ne yaptığımızı bir açıklayalım. OpenResty’nin yayınlanan son version adresini kullanarak tar dosyasını sunucumuza çekiyoruz.
Ardından paket sahibinin public keyini eklememiz gerekiyor. OpenResty’nin download sayfasında gösterildiği gibi public key A0E98066 olmalı. Public key’i eklemek için aşağıdaki komutu çalıştırmalıyız. Burada sunucuya bağlanma işlemleri biraz uzun sürüyor ve bağlantı hataları alabiliyoruz. Ben kurulumda 3–4 kez çalıştırmak zorunda kaldım ve en sonunda key’i eklemeyi başarabildim.
Key eklendikten sonra terminale basılan çıktıda “ Yichun Zhang “ ismini görmelisiniz. Bu sayede doğru public key’i eklediğimizi doğrulamış oluyoruz. Public key’i de indirdiğimize göre artık indirdiğimiz paketin imzasını doğrulayabiliriz.
Terminale basılan çıktıda “ Good signature” metnini görüyorsanız herşey doğru demektir. Bu işlemin ardından indirdiğimiz tar dosyasını extract edip klasörün içerisine geçiş yapıyoruz.
OpenResty’i compile edebilmek için gerekli olan araçları aşağıdaki komut yardımı ile yüklüyoruz.
Gerekli olan birkaç paket daha var. Onları da yükleyelim.
Buraya kadar herşey sorunsuz gitti ise artık OpenResty yüklemesini başlatmak için tüm hazılıklar tamam demektir. Sırasıyla aşağıdaki komutları çalıştırıyoruz.
Ardından http ve https portları için firewall izinlerini veriyoruz.
Bu işlemlerden sonra OpenResty’nin çalışıp çalışmadığını test etmeliyiz. Bunun için ilk olarak OpenResty’i başlatıyoruz.
Eğer herhangi bir hata yoksa yukarıdaki komutun herhangi bir çıktı vermeden çalışmış olması gerekiyor. Artık http://sunucunuzun_ip_adresi'ne istek gönderdiğinizde Welcome to OpenResty! sayfasını görebiliyor olmalıyız.
Nginx’in OpenResty ile çalışıp çalışmadığını test etmek için aşağıdaki komutu çalıştıralım. (Kısa bir not: Eğer nginx -V komutu not found hatası veriyorsa export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/nginx/sbin:$PATH komutunu kullanarak nginx yolunu tanımladıktan sonra tekrar denemelisiniz.):
Ekranda aşağıdaki çıktıyı görüyorsanız herşey başarılı demektir.
Sunucumuzun olası reboot durumlarında OpenResty’nin otomatik olarak başlatılması için servis haline getirmek akıllıca bir yaklaşım olur. Bu yüzden gerekli olan systemd dosyasını oluşturuyoruz.
Bu dosyanın içeriğine aşağıdaki komutları kopyalıyoruz.
Kaydedip çıktıktan sonra sıra log dosyasını oluşturmaya geliyor. Log dosyasını oluşturmak ve ardından openresty’nin yeni log dosyası ile yeniden yüklenmesini sağlıyoruz.
Gerekli konfigürasyonları yapabilmek için lua-resty-auto-ssl paketini yüklememiz gerekiyor. Fakat bunu yükleyebilmek için LuaRocks ismindeki lua package manager’i yüklemeliyiz. Ben kurulum sırasında “unzip notfound” hatası almıştım. O yüzden siz ilk olarak unzip paketini yüklemekle başlayabilirsiniz.
Ardından luarocks package manager kurulumuna geçebiliriz. Sırasıyla aşağıdaki komutları çalıştırıp kurulumu tamamlıyoruz.
Kurulum sırasında luajit yoluna ihtiyaç olduğu için eğer not found hataları ile karşılaşırsanız aşağıdaki komut ile path’i tanımlayabilirsiniz.
LuaRocks package manager kurulumu tamamlandığına göre artık lua-resty-auto-ssl paketini kurabiliriz.
Birazdan nginx dosyasını konfigure ederken lua scriptinde http isteğinde bulunacağımız için lua-resty-http paketine ihtiyacımız var. Onu da yüklüyoruz.
Bu işlemin ardından SSL ile ilgili gerekli dosyaların saklanacağı ve OpenResty’nin ihtiyaç duyduğu klasörü yaratıp www-data kullanıcısına bu klasör için gerekli yetkileri veriyoruz. (Not: www-data kullanıcısını OpenResty’nin nginx konfigürasyonunu yaparken kullanacağız.)
Biliyorum buraya kadar olan kısım gerekli altyapıyı hazırlamak ile geçtiği için biraz sıkıcı görünüyor. Şimdi asıl can alıcı noktaya geldik. Auto-SSL için nginx konfigürasyon dosyamızı yapılandıracağız ve bu işlemin ardından custom domain desteği ve auto-ssl desteğini kullanıcılarımıza sağlamış olacağız.
Nginx ayarlarını yapmak için /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf yolunda bulunan nginx.conf dosyasını modifiye edeceğiz. Nginx dosyasında bulunan her bir konfigürasyonu tek tek açıklamayacağım. Sadece auto-ssl üretmek için gerekli olan bölümleri ve lua script kısmını açıklayacağım. Dilerseniz lua-resty-auto-ssl github sayfasından diğer ayarların açıklamalarına ulaşabilirsiniz.
Nginx dosyasında domain için SSL yaratıp yaratmayacağımıza karar verdiğimiz kısım init_by_lua_block ile başlayan kısım. Burada resty’nin auto_ssl paketinin allow_domain fonksiyonunu kullanacağız. Bu script parametre olarak isteğin geldiği domaini alan basit bir fonksiyon sağlıyor. Bu scriptte ihtiyacınıza göre SSL yaratmaya karar veren spesifik kodları yazabilirsiniz.
Bizim SAAS platformumuzda kullanıcıların custom domainleri veritabanında turuluyor. Dolayısı ile biz veritabanındaki custom domain bilgisinin varlığını sorgulayarak SSL yaratıp yaratmayacağımıza karar verebiliriz.
Şöyle ki; bir custom domainden gelen ilk istekte allow_domain fonksiyonu çalışacak ve basitçe web uygulamamızdaki bir rest api endpointine gelen domainin veritabanında olup olmadığını soracak. Eğer cevap 200 dönerse domainin sistemimizde kayıtlı olduğunu anlayıp SSL yaratma işlemini başlatacak. Dönen 404 cevapları içinse bu domain için SSL yaratmayıp işlemi sonlandıracağız.
Bunu yapmak için Go uygulamamızda aşağıdaki gibi domainin varlığını sorgulayan basit bir rest api endpointi açıyoruz. Örnek kod şu şekilde:
Go kısmı bu kadar. Şimdi de nginx tarafında bu rest api endpointine http isteğini gönderecek olan lua scriptini yazalım. İlk olarak allow_domain fonksiyonunun bize verdiği domain parametresinin root domainimiz (example.com) ve bu root domaininden türeyen bir subdomain (.example.com) olup olmadığına bakacağız. Eğer bunlardan biri ise SSL sertifikası üretmek istemediğimizi belirten false döneceğiz. Bunların haricinde gelen custom domainlerin sistemimizde kayıtlı olup olmadığını anlamak için web uygulamamıza istek göndereceğiz. Dönen cevap 200 ise true dönüp SSL sertifikası yaratma sürecini başlatacağız. Aksi hallerde false dönüp işlemi sonlandıracağız. Bu mantığı işleyen basit lua scriptini aşağıda görebilirsiniz.
Şimdi gelelim nginx dosyasına eklememiz gereken diğer kısımlara. auto-ssl lua scriptini başlatmaktan sorumlu olan kod bloğunu ekliyoruz.
Let’s encrypt tarafından gerçekleştirilecek domain doğrulamaları için http 80 portu üzerinde çalışan bir endpointe ihtiyac var. O yüzden aşağıdaki server bloğunu nginx konfig dosyamıza eklememiz gerekiyor. Aşağıdaki kodda ilk if bloğu benim domainim için gelen http requestlerini https’e yönlendirdiğim bir regex kuralı. example.com ile ilgili ayarların auto-ssl ile bir ilgisi yok. En altta yer alan location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ bloğu bizim için önemli olan kısım.
Https isteklerinde custom domainler için ssl sertifikalarını dönen veya sertifika yok ise oluşturmayı sağlayan dinamik bir handlera ihtiyacımız var. Bu yüzden aşağıdaki https server bloğunu ekliyoruz. Bu blokta auto-ssl için bizi ilgilendiren kısım ssl_certificate_by_lua_block ile başlayan blok. Diğer ayarlar benim domainim için yapmış olduğum ayarlar. Sizin domain ayarlarınıza göre bu kısımlar değişiklik gösterebilir.
Eklememiz gereken son bir server bloğu daha kaldı. SSL sertifikaları ile ilgili internal görevleri yapacak olan 8999 portunda çalışan aşağıdaki server bloğunu ekliyoruz.
Bu işlemlerden sonra nginx.conf dosyamız tüm ayarları ile birlikte aşağıdaki gibi olmalı:
Ayarlarımızın aktif olması için OpenResty’i yeniden başlatalım.
Eğer konfigürasyonumuzda bir sıkıntı varsa openresty hata verecektir. Olası hata durumunda OpenResty’nin statüsünü ve loglarını kontrol ederek yönlendirmelere göre hatayı fixleyebilirsiniz.
Artık sunucumuz custom domain ve SSL desteğini sağladığı için kullanıcılarınızın tek yapması gereken kendilerine ait olan domainlerini sizin sunucunuzun ip adresine yönlendirmek. Yönlendirmenin ardından custom domainden sizin sunucunuza gelen ilk istekde lua scriptimiz web uygulamamıza ilgili domainin var olup olmadığına dair bir istek gönderecek ve eğer varsa ssl sertifikası yaratılacaktır. Bu yüzden ilk isteklerde 10 saniyelik bir gecikme yaşanabilir. SSL birkez yaratıldıktan sonra artık bu gecikme ortadan kalkacak ve sonraki istekler full SSL desteği ile çalışacaktır.
Yaratılan SSL’ler yine Let’s Encrypt tarafından kontrol edildiği için 3 aylık periyotlarda otomatik olarak yenilenecektir. Siz isteğinize göre bu süreyi daha yakın bir tarihe çekebilirsiniz. Şimdilik bu kadar. Uzun bir makale oldu biliyorum ama hiç bir detayı atlamadan eksiksiz anlatmaya çalıştım.
Bir sonraki makalede görüşmek dileğiyle. Kalın sağlıcakla.

UPDATE 2020: I have moved away from Medium! You can find this article and all the new ones >>>__HERE__<<<
Over the past few years, the world's best entrepreneurs and investors have released highly valuable articles about SaaS startups. Christoph Janz wrote about funding, Neeraj Agrawal wrote about growth, Jason Lemkin wrote about… well, everything.
One thing, in particular, makes those readings great: they contain a ton of numbers and metrics that are helpful to understand what a successful startup looks like at each step of the growth journey.
So what happens when you put those numbers together in a spreadsheet? Can you paint the big picture of a SaaS startup in Silicon Valley, from inception to IPO?
Yes, and here is the result:
This article will walk you through the different steps that lead us to the chart above. (Update April 2019: By popular demand, I added a link to the spreadsheet fully editable by all. Feel free to play around and geek out, I have another copy somewhere safe 😛 )
Bear in mind that the numbers presented here are orders of magnitude rather than hard rules. They mostly apply to Silicon Valley-based, VC-backed, SaaS startups. Take them with a grain of salt :)
Starting a startup is a long-term game.
Steve Blank, Morgan Brown, Brian Balfour, and Reid Hoffman have all described their own vision of the startup lifecycle. When looking at it, we notice that a successful startup goes through 3 phases during its life:
In 2016, the TTU (time-to-unicorn) was stable at 6 years in the US, courtesy of the good people at fleximize. A unicorn, as originally defined by Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures, is a tech company, public or private, that reaches $1 billion in valuation. More recent definitions exclude public companies from the scope for obscure reasons. Regardless, joining the blessing of unicorns remains a big deal, if not the mark of success for most founders.
What about SaaS IPOs, then? Data from Pitchbook suggest a median time of 8.2 years between first VC funding and IPO. Throw in an extra 12 months of existence before the first funding round (purely speculative), and we are looking at a TTI (time-to-IPO) of nine years, give or take. So much for the quick buck!
In a 2015 article, Neeraj Agrawal suggested that SaaS growth follows a clear pattern.
First, you establish a product market fit. First, you establish product-market fit (PMF) either instantly or within up to two years. Second, you reach $2 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), which is another one to two years. From there on, things become pretty predictable and Neeraj puts forward the T2D3 rule (i.e. revenue triples twice then doubles thrice in the 5 following years).
Bottom line: you should pass the $100 million mark in ARR six to nine years after starting.
What about after that? According to Rory Driscoll of Scale Venture Partner, “for a best-in-class SaaS company, the growth rate for any given year is [82] percent of the growth rate of that same company in the prior year”.
In a nutshell:
Now that’s the top line is clear, let’s look at the bottom line.
In the early days, it is safe to assume that the company grosses in little to no profit. Once you are above $50M ARR, however, things change.
In a 2015 article, Brad Feld formulates the 40 percent rule: your growth rate + your profit should add up to 40%.
(The graph is originally from Pacific Crest Group, found via this article by Dave Kellog. Kudos to both of them).
We will assume that you run your infrastructure in the cloud, so profit = EBITDA. But as Feld points out, reality may be more complex if you run your own infrastructure.
Fundraising also follows patterns. Based on Chris Janz’s world-famous napkin, a SaaS startup can expect to raise:
Let’s assume that you raise funds every 18 months for seed, series A and B. After that, things become blurry.
Janz also offers typical valuations and round sizes in his article, so you can easily assess whether your $10 million ask for a seed round is realistic (hint — it’s probably not).
As your startup grows, you may be presented with opportunities to sell.
Perhaps a competitor with deeper pockets wants to clear up space — Hired and Match.com are really good at that. Or perhaps a large corporation will see a “strategic fit” with your team, product and/or clients. Think GM with Cruise or Microsoft with Linkedin. Most of the time, it’s both.
These opportunities, however, are not equally distributed during the startup lifecycle. According to Jason Lemkin, there are two local maxima for an acquisition:
So if you feel like you won’t make it to the next milestone, it may make sense to sell at a local maximum. Or is there an alternative?
If you want to go big, you want to IPO. But what makes a SaaS IPO? A successful IPO follows a line that O'Driscoll calls the “Mendoza line”, with ARR on the x-axis and forward growth rate on the y-axis.
In short, this is what your metrics should look like before you go public:
These numbers are incredibly hard to achieve, and that’s what the author calls “the realistic low bar to IPO”. Unsurprisingly, there have been only 21 tech IPOs per year over the last five years.
To put it in perspective, let’s look at what it means in terms of sales.
Our target is $100M ARR. Now, your ARPA (average revenue per account) is a constant by definition. So you can derive the number of clients that you need following Chris Janz’ chart.
At $10 million ARPA, you need 10 clients to IPO. At $1 million ARPA, you need 100 clients to IPO. … At $100 ARPA, you need 1 million clients to IPO.
Say you address a market of “prosumers” like Wix, Typeform, Evernote or Mailchimp do. You charge on average $100 per year per customer. Not only do you need 1 million paying customers to IPO, but you also need to add 250,000 more customers next year (and/or upsell by as much).
Still looks like something feasible? Then let’s look at how much people it takes to build this kind of company.
The headcount increases as you move forward through the startup lifecycle.
Conveniently enough, Tom Tunguz from Redpoint has already done the math for us. In SaaS companies at scale, the average revenue per employee stands at $200,000.
True, this is for 2012 and this is for companies at scale. If you have better numbers, hit me up and I’ll update them!
At the end of the day, that is what our roadmap to a SaaS IPO looks like. You can also check out and play around with the spreadsheet if that's your thing :)
Keep in mind that this is “unicorning your way to $100M ARR” i.e. it’s the (supposedly) perfect trajectory. Obviously, it’s a super wide generalization. Not one startup will follow this roadmap strictly, and counterexamples abound. But frameworks are useful, and hopefully this one will be useful too.
We hope that you enjoyed this reading. If so, hold the 👏 button and give it 50 claps! To read more, you can also check out this article presenting 9 methods for startup valuation.

https://saasholic.com/criando-um-time-de-cs-customer-success-para-o-seu-saas-ae069d629df7?source=search_post---------222,"Há 5 meses atrás eu lancei um artigo aqui no SaaSholics— Criando um time de vendas para o seu SaaS. Naquele momento, estávamos buscando crescer as vendas da Bunee.io (🐰🐰🐰 BTW, a melhor plataforma para contratação de programadores) e organizar nossos processos de vendas.
Nesse tempo, conseguimos dezenas de clientes pagos recorrentes, saímos de um time de 3 pessoas para um time de 8 pessoas, contemplando a área de Recrutamento, Tecnologia e Vendas. Contudo, ainda estamos com um problema bastante comum em um SaaS — O maldito CHURN.
Como diz meu amigo Lincoln Murphy em seu artigo The Only Two Reasons Customers Churn, o CHURN é o oposto do GROWTH e está ligado a você não conseguir cumprir o REQUIRED OUTCOME (RESULTADO OBRIGATÓRIO) do seu cliente. Ele ainda cita alguns dos principais motivos disso acontecer:
O pessoal da Totango ainda criou uma apresentação sobre os 12 principais motivos para churn de seus clientes SaaS e como previní-los.
Considero que nós da Bunee.io somos bem ligado a métricas, mas sempre bate a dúvida na hora de resolver um problema de como reter mais clientes…
Essa foi a primeira dúvida que tivemos, pois queremos o “SaaS Dream” de conseguir clientes pagos NO TOUCH ou LOW TOUCH, então decidimos em um primeiro momento intervir no produto, criando um fluxo de onboarding consistente que guiasse nosso cliente pela plataforma.
Tivemos um crescimento de 100% em um mês em nosso LTV, e depois, um crescimento de 20% ao mês em nosso LTV, através de melhorias de produto, mais alinhamento no processo de vendas (com DEMO) e tentativas de acompanhamentos semanais com nossos clientes.
Talvez, para o seu negócio, você não precise contratar um profissional de CS agora, podendo atuar inicialmente e diretamente em um melhor onboarding de seus clientes, o que leva a próxima pergunta:
Uma vez me disseram que você deve contratar alguém para fazer algo que você não teve competência para fazer, sem “mas”.
Momento desabafo — canal religioso
É bizarramente difícil empreender, administrar, vender, fazer interface com investidores, alinhar felicidade e expectativa de seus colaboradores e ainda cuidar de seus clientes. Nesses anos de experiência, já sei o que eu faço muito mal, e o que eu faço muito bem, e o segredo não está em melhorar o que você faz mal, e sim potencializar o que você faz bem, para o lado negativo, contrate alguém 🙂
Muitas vezes, a solução para sua empresa não está na contratação de uma pessoa, e sim, uma ferramenta de onboarding poderosa como a https://conpass.io do amigo Ivan Biava.
Inclusive o Ivan rodou uma pesquisa com dezenas de diretores para determinar o quanto o onboarding impacta no churn das empresas.
Perguntei ao Lincoln Murphy sobre o que ele achava sobre a decisão de contratar uma pessoa de CS, e ele me deu a seguinte resposta exclusivamente para esse artigo:
No momento em que você entende o que é o verdadeiro sucesso do cliente, por que está trabalhando o sucesso do cliente, e como o gerenciamento do Customer Success está funcionando, é hora de contratar seu primeiro CSM. Não antes. Qualquer CSM que funcione para uma empresa que não seja clara nessas coisas, não é um CSM que você deseja que trabalhe para você.– Lincoln Murphy
Então você decidiu que deseja contratar um profissional de sucesso do cliente, quais serão as tarefas dele? quais habilidades essa persona precisa ter? quais as métricas de sucesso? qual o objetivo final dessa pessoa?
Como não vim desse setor, precisei fazer o mesmo que fiz quando criei o time de Sales na Bunee, estudar!

Vale lembrar que um draft de KPI é super importante para saber que tarefas a pessoa desempenhará e como ambos saberem que está dando certo, gerando transparência na relação entre empresa e colaborador. Assim, as métricas podem ser alteradas em comum acordo com o colaborador, assim como novas métricas podem ser inseridas.
Contactar de forma pró-ativa e estar presente de forma passiva para nossos clientes, ajudando no onboarding, analisando suas dificuldades e necessidades, sugerindo melhoria para o produto ou hackeando processos para que os clientes fiquem satisfeitos, gerando uma confiança na hora de reter o mesmo ou até mesmo gerar um upsell.

Depois de ler diversos artigos sobre características de um profissional de Sucesso do Cliente, optei por escolher as soft skills do artigo The 5 Critical Strengths Your Customer Success Team Needs.
1 — Comunicador2 — Organizado3 — Motivado a dar sempre o melhor (traduzi não literalmente do termo drive)4 — Estrategista5 — Empático
Perguntei também ao amigo Andre Denofrio da Ontrack, sobre que tipo de pessoa contratar como CS:
Empatia e comunicação são habilidades chave. Mas o indispensável é ser alguém com vontade de aprender e crescer.– Andre Denofrio
Sabemos que não temos budget para trazer um CS Manager, ou uma pessoa super bem treinada de um curso ou que já teve boas passagens no mercado. Temos uma cultura própria e precisamos usar isso para treinar alguém que possuam as soft skills acima. Por conta disso, optamos por dar oportunidade a qualquer pessoa que se enquadre no item anterior, o que abriria bastante o leque da vaga.
Ué De Luna, mas a pessoa não deveria ter conhecimento no seu setor para ser uma boa CS?
Utilizarei o texto na íntegra (em inglês) que está no artigo Hiring for Customer Success do Dave Blake:
Industry/Domain Expertise — Many may disagree with me, but industry/domain expertise is typically at the bottom of my list. The reason why is that if a candidate is strong in all the other areas mentioned above, I believe they can quickly learn the industry/domain (with few exceptions). As an example, I had no experience at all in web analytics when I started at Omniture. None. However, I was able to pick it up over time and have sufficient knowledge to successfully support my clients. Deep expertise typically came from our consultants, but I knew enough to get the job done. The same was true about the majority of the CSMs I hired. Very few if any came from a web analytics or digital marketing background, but all were able to learn quickly and effectively manage their clients. Hire smart CSMs and train them on the industry and domain.
Nesse processo, decidi fazer algo diferente! Antes de divulgar uma vaga oficial, optei por divulgar em meu Facebook oficial, permitindo que pessoas próximas ou de 2 nível pudessem ser impactadas. Assim, lancei o seguinte texto:
Que tal uma vaga como Customer Success da Bunee.io?Sim, sabíamos que esse dia chegaria!Então vamos saber um pouco mais sobre essa vaga de CS Junior 🐰se você é/tem:– people skills– adora resolver problemas– disposição de receber um problema e pensar na melhor forma de resolver– faz tudo com amor e boa energia– quer trabalhar em uma startup em crescimento– sabe falar bem e adora bater-papo– busca um trabalho que acredita também na qualidade de vida, remoto com 6 horas de trabalho, para você curtir mais o seu dia e ser felizMe mande um e-mail com seu Linkedin em deluna+CS@bunee.ioO que está esperando? Vaaaai láaa (música do guanabara tudo por você)
Em 1 dia já passamos de 14 emails recebidos com candidatos de diferentes níveis. Como eu sei que a relação de sucesso de uma vaga é de 1/10, me dei por satisfeito para continuar o processo de seleção.
Utilizamos os modelos de contratação da Bunee.io para testarmos novas formas de comunicação, de canais, de processos e testes. Como sabemos que uma pessoa de CS tem que ser uma pessoa comunicativa e boa praça, desenhamos o seguinte processo de contratação:
1 — Envio de email com o Linkedin (entrada no funil de recrutamento)2 — Análise de CV de Linkedin, dando notas de 1 a 3.3 — Envio de e-mail para os candidatos convidando para eles enviarem um vídeo de até 4 minutos para um número de wpp respondendo as seguintes perguntas:
a) se apresentando (nome, idade, quem você é)b) por que aplicou como CS?c) o que você acredita que pode fazer pela bunee.io?d) como pretende fazer isso?e) qual sua pretensão salarial?
4 — Análise em cima dos vídeos, dando notas de 1 a 35 — Análise de DNA (se essa pessoa vai agregar em diversidade a empresa), dando nota binária de 0 ou 1.6 — Corte de quem estiver muito acima na pretensão salarial (geralmente R$ 1000,00 acima do nosso teto)(no artigo de sales explico porque não negocio salário).7 — Entrevista final via call, onde adaptamos o roteiro que usamos na vaga de sales:
a) Pergunta: Como você se venderia pra mim?b) Pergunta: Como você abordaria um novo cliente da bunee.io?c) Pergunta: Eu quero cancelar a bunee.io? O que você faria?d) Pergunta: O que você poderia me ensinar que eu ainda não sei?e) Pergunta: Se eu pudesse te contratar para qualquer setor da empresa, não importa salário ou processo, qual desafio você gostaria de ter?f) Abro para me perguntar sobre qualquer coisa da empresa ou foundersg) Conto um pouco da minha história e da empresa, como nossa cultura, missão e visão
Para facilitar a decisão junto com os sócios, anotei as respostas, pontuei com um score de 1 a 3, e convidei os sócios a fazerem o mesmo (com nota binária de 0 ou 1), nos juntamos para avançarmos na contratação.
A votação binária para os sócios não funcionou tão bem como desenhada. No processo, os sócios sentiram falta de poder dar uma nota maior, e poder ser mais gradual, ou seja, não apenas dizer que gostou ou não da pessoa, e sim o quanto ele gostou da pessoa. Assim sendo, nas próximas entrevistas para qualquer setor, vamos permitir que os sócios também dêem nota de 1 a 3, enquanto o gestor responsável deve aumentar sua nota para de 1 a 5.
Os 5 finalistas do processo eram muito bons, gostaríamos de ter tido mais vagas para colocar mais gente, mas decidimos por uma profissional que acreditamos muito ter a cara da Bunee, que passou muito bem de todas as etapas e conseguiu se colocar de forma próativa no lugar do cliente.
Espero que seja o começo de muitas pessoas em nosso time de CS, revolucionando ainda mais a forma que empresas encontram os melhores devs no Brasil.
Espero que essa timeline de CS possa ajudá-los em seus processos. Qualquer ajuda ou feedback, dê um alô no meu twitter Bernard De Luna, e se tiver precisando de programadores? Fale com a Bunee.ioSaaSholic

Hay dos cosas que me encantan del modelo de negocio SaaS. 1. La recurrencia de ingresos. Si das en la clave un día de repente tienes la gallina de los huevos de oro con un recurrente orgánico “casi” sin hacer nada. 2. Puedes tener todo muy controlado, al detalle. Puedes identificar rápidamente cómo está funcionando tu negocio y tomar decisiones rápidas.
¿Qué hacemos en Upplication para tener controlada la evolución de la empresa? Tenemos un panel de métricas que nos cuenta absolutamente todo lo que necesitamos saber. Subjetivamente creo que es más que suficiente para tener controladas tus métricas de negocio. He querido hacer público el panel para todo el que lo quiera usar, están todas las fórmulas creadas simplemente para que metáis vuestros números y cambiéis detalles (como el nombre de los planes de precios o los diferentes partners que os traigan clientes):

ACTUALIZACIÓN IMPORTANTE: Hemos lanzado la marca Minimalism Brand y hemos hecho públicas todas nuestras métricas ecommerce de facturación, tráfico y conversiones. Aquí lo tienes para que te sirva de guía.

PESTAÑAS
Como podéis ver existen dos pestañas, “Weekly” y “Monthly”. En la primera analizamos el comportamiento de nuestras métricas día a día, mientras que en “Monthly” se muestra la evolución mensual. La pestaña “Monthly” se alimenta de todo lo que vayas poniendo en “Weekly”, esta es realmente la pestaña que vas a usar en tu día a día.
En nuestro panel Upplication además tenemos la pestaña “Cohorts” ( medimos las tasas de retención y baja de nuestros clientes), “Adquisition” (medimos como funcionan nuestros diferentes canales de captación para acabar sacando nuestro coste de captación final), “Activation” (medimos los ratios de conversión de nuestro proceso comercial).
ESTRUCTURA
Dividimos cada hoja en 4 partes:
MÉTRICAS
Aquí la explicación de algunas métricas:
MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), el ingreso recurrente mensual del total de tus clientes activos. Como podéis ver también está la versión “blended”, esta se calcula sumando todos los planes mensuales activos más todos los planes anuales activos prorrateados en 12 meses.
ARPU (Average Revenue per User), precio medio que sacas a tu cliente mes a mes y año a año. Aquí también tenemos la versión “blended”, se calcula dividiendo el MRR blended entre el total de clientes.
CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value), el valor total que tiene un cliente de media. Esto se calcula multiplicando el “ARPU blended” por el tiempo medio que se queda tu cliente pagando por tu herramienta.
CHURN RATE, para calcular de manera fiable tu tasa de baja y el tiempo medio de tus clientes tienes que hacer análisis de cohortes, de lo que ya hablaremos con detenimiento en otro post. Si queréis aprender sobre ello el emprendedor François Derboix escribió sobre ello aquí.
Sé que es un post complejo para algunos, os respondo cualquier duda lo más rápido que pueda. Aun no sé de que voy a hablar en el siguiente post, ¿alguna idea?
Aprovecho este post para dar las gracias a mi socios y amigo José Luis Vega de Seoane (@joseluisVDS) que me introdujo en esto de las métricas.

Today is January 10, 2017. That means that in ten days, this jerk will become the leader of the free world. Ugh. It still feels surreal to me. In less earth shattering news, the fact that it’s 2017 also means that my “SaaS Funding in 2016” napkin needs an update. As a reminder, in the original post I tried to give a “back of a napkin” answer to this question: What does it take to raise capital, in SaaS, in 2016? Today I’d like to take a stab at the (early) 2017 answer to that question.
Like in the 2016 version, the assumption is that the founding team is relatively “unproven”. Founders with significant previous exits can raise large seed rounds at high valuations early on, so the “rules” are different for them. On another note, when I say “what does it take to raise capital” I mean “what does it take to have an easy time raising capital from great investors”. If your company doesn’t meet the (very high) bar pictured on the napkin it doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to raise money at all. It just means that it probably won’t be easy, that you will likely have to talk to a large number of investors and that you may not be able to raise from a well-known firm.
So, what does it take to raise capital, in SaaS, in early 2017? I don’t think a huge amount has changed since I created the first version of the napkin about nine months ago, but here are a few observations:
I already wrote about the rising table stakes in SaaS two years ago, and since then the bar has kept increasing. The SaaS companies included in Tomasz Tunguz’ benchmarking analysis of exceptional Series A companies grew on average from $10k to more than $90k in MRR in their first year of commercialization and then to over $400k of ending MRR in their second:
Twilio, Workday, and Zendesk have shown that the best SaaS companies can get to $100M in ARR in 6–7 years and continue to grow at around 50–70% year-over-year after hitting that milestone. Slack, unbelievably, reached $100M in ARR just 2.5 years after launch. Slack is an outlier even among the outliers, but getting to $100M in about seven years and hitting $300M 2–3 years later is the type growth which the best investors in the Valley are looking for in 2017.
I didn’t have to make a lot of changes to the napkin to reflect this since the growth rates that I had put into the 2016 version were already in line with the “T2D3 path”. I’ve increased the Series B amount, valuation and MRR range, though, and because the expectations of later-stage investors trickle down to the earlier stages I’ve changed the ARR potential number in the “Seed” column from “$100M+ ARR” to “$100–300M+ ARR”.
Investors are increasingly questioning if you can build a large and long-term sustainable SaaS business by being primarily a workflow tool. The thinking is that every successful software product will eventually be commoditized because it attracts lots of people who will copy the product and offer it for a lower price. That concern isn’t new, of course, but given how crowded most SaaS categories have become by now, investors are increasingly looking for additional ways to build moat around a business. So if you want to raise capital for your SaaS startup in 2017, investors will wonder if you can become a true system of record, build a real platform/ecosystem/marketplace or build a unique data asset over time. The latter option will get particular attention this year, so I highlighted that in the “Defensibility” row of the napkin. The ability to gather large amounts of data from the entire user base, and use that data along with AI/ML to make your software smarter, is one of the big themes at the moment. For what it’s worth, I know AI and Machine Learning are a hyped topic but I think the hype is justified.
You might think that some of the things that I’ve written here — getting to $100M ARR within a few years, thinking about $300M ARR at the seed stage — are just crazy. I won’t argue with that. The vast majority of SaaS companies will never get to this level of growth or scale, and yet they can be successful and profitable companies that generate life-changing wealth for the founders and great returns for early investors. VCs need outliers to make their business model work, but that’s not your problem. If you think you don’t have strong potential to become one of these crazy outliers, maybe VC isn’t right for you.
OK. Enough words. Here’s the 2017 SaaS Funding Napkin!

Much has been written by VC’s about building “full stack startups,” “owning the customer with a strategic product” and finding the “killer app to build a platform on.”
Actually, at the extreme, that’s pretty much the opposite of what developers want — which is something a lot more modular (preferably open source) that solves their specific problem well yet offers the flexibility of a diverse, transparent and rapidly innovating ecosystem of components: consider Docker’s batteries included, but removable philosophy.
If I’m any knowledge worker, I can find and begin using Quip and Dropbox on my own. If I’m handling customer success, I can use FullStory to replay a user problem and Intercom to communicate. As a marketer, I can A/B test my website with Optimizely, slice and dice my mobile events in Amplitude, and build richer cross-channel profiles with Lytics. As a salesperson, I can use ClearSlide to present to potential customers, and RelateIQ to keep track of my meetings and customers.
And those just scratch the surface — the long tail is a lot more interesting (and often a lot more risky!) than that. The average company (per SkyHigh’s quarterly cloud adoption report, based on data about 17M users) uses 923 different services delivered via the web. This is > 10x more than IT expects. The average individual employee now uses 28 cloud apps for work. They don’t want to wait for their technology team to tell them what limited set of technology they can use to do their job.
Other companies report similar app ecosystem diversity. Okta has over 4,000 application partners, and their average 2014 deployment included 14 identity-managed apps per user (up from 8 in 2013).
SkyHigh and Okta are already helping to solve the visibility, security and accessibility problem for SaaS. However, companies also need supporting data infrastructure. Without that, this Cambrian explosion of individually and departmentally-adopted apps and services creates information silos and an ongoing integration burden for the technology team.
In other words, a proliferation of web services without a rational integration plan results in just another untenable compatibility matrix from hell that results in lost productivity, useless and duplicative engineering effort, and vendor lock-in.
Significant companies offering “enterprise integration platforms” have been built, from Mulesoft to SnapLogic. But one of the things we learned from Docker is that not all customers want the entire proprietary Platform-as-a-Service, given the choice. They’d rather have the right (open source) spec and a single standard interface — and they are quite inventive about what to use and build on top.
We’re seeing a lot more companies pursuing this vision, in different areas — companies like Segment, which is focused on building a lightweight customer data service to support productivity in a paradigm of application choice. The success of services like this will enable companies to use best of breed applications for every need, while maintaining user ownership of consistent data, from across their different platforms, available across all their separate systems.
They can’t rely on their deeply integrated suite of products to lock the customer in. Developers were the first to break out, but we think the rest will follow, and this is a good thing.
Let a million flowers bloom. Let us find rational architectural points to see them, secure them, enable them, and bring them together in open but integrated ecosystems. And let us be freed from the shackles of bad software.

Zenefits is a 21st century HR company that’s aiming to be the one place to connect and manage all of your HR services. Despite being around for only 2 years, they’ve raised over $80 million in funding, and are currently valued at $500 million. As you might expect, the company’s had an unbelievable growth trajectory so far, and has been labeled the “fastest growing SaaS company ever.”
Recently, I had the fantastic opportunity to sit down with Parker Conrad, the founder and CEO of Zenefits. He shared with me some of the challenges that Zenefits has had with scaling at such an incredible clip, and the observations he’s had along the way. Here are five of them.
Note: The following interview excerpts are from my new book, Unscalable: Unorthodox startup growth stories.
Read more about Zenefits, GitHub, Codecademy, and a number of other companies.
None of our forms were automated at first. What would happen is someone would go through online system and enroll in insurance and we’d get an email saying “so and so completed…,” and we would pull a DB extract of all their answers and fill out the form by hand. We originally hired someone to sort of deal with that, but over time it became mechanized. The PDF became automatically generated with all of the information filled out and signature attached to the bottom.
And over time this became more and more meta. At first we would manually fill the forms. Then we would automate form-filling but we would manually set up the automation. But every insurance carrier in every state has separate forms for all these different transactions. So they have their own forms, and you need to automate each of them separately in the system. It got to the point where we were spending all of our time automating forms. So we wrote software to automate form-automation, so someone non-technical could go in and upload a form, and just point out which point of the form to fill out with which information.
The most intractable area of [HR systems] — the hardest systems to deal with — are the insurance ones. They’re all stuck in 1986. And for companies with fewer than 100 employees, they don’t accept anything other than **faxes** to make changes to add or remove employees. It’s all on paper, all via fax machine.
And it’s actually even worse than that because not only are they using fax machines, but they’re unreliable in processing information. When you send them a fax to make a change, 90% of the time they do their job correctly, but 10% of the time the fax machine will come out the other end and whoever is in charge of processing that day had too much work to do and it got lost in the shuffle and it never happened, or they typed it in wrong and someone added employee A to company B and added employee B to company A, and you actually need to call and follow up and close the loop with every change that you make with the insurance company. You have to pick up the phone and make sure it was done correctly, and that’s the ultimate thing that doesn’t scale.
At the time, we were actually racing another company in our Y Combinator batch. It was called Simply Insured. Originally it was fairly different from us, but about halfway through YC the founders decided that they wanted to do what we were doing, and the company pivoted into our market.
So we found ourselves sprinting to be the first ones out the door. Because the first company that launched would be summarized as “Company XYZ launches to make insurance benefits simpler for small businesses,” and whoever launched a couple weeks later would get “Company ABC seems to be derivative of XYZ and does the same thing and why are they doing the same thing as Company XYZ?” It wouldn’t matter that we had started our product first if they launched theirs first.
We wanted to just launch something in order to get out the door. So when we had our launch article in TechCrunch, literally half the product didn’t exist yet. We figured that nobody was going to dive so deep into the product that they would actually get to [the end]. We reasoned that most companies would stop [halfway through] and want to talk to us. That gave us at least a couple of days after we launched to get the second half built.
Even though we launched at the end of April in 2013, by January 2014 we had actually become the largest insurance broker in the state of California for new businesses.
This is interesting because insurance companies are not used to seeing their brokers grow that quickly. They looked at their top 20 or so brokers, and most of the those guys have been in that top 20 list for 30 years or longer. And we went from nonexistent to number 1 in 8 months. They couldn’t believe it, and suddenly we had a lot of VP-level people from all these different insurance carriers coming by our office and trying to understand how it happened. They asked us, “Hey, how can we work more closely with you guys, what can we do to get more business from you?”
With a lot of the things that seem scalable, you will find bottlenecks you never imagined that you suddenly need to find solutions for. For example, the way we were generating our list of companies to reach out to — there was a manual step in this process where someone had to copy and paste information into an Excel spreadsheet. We got to a point where that person could not physically do their copy/paste job fast enough and the growth of the company was literally constrained by this person’s ability to load the information into Excel and then our marketing software. Never in a million years did we think that would be a bottleneck for us. So we had to automate a lot of the process and build software around that.
It’s a lot easier to figure out how to scale something that doesn’t feel like it would scale than it is to figure out what is actually gonna work. You’re much better off going after something that will work that doesn’t scale, then trying to figure how to scale it up, than you are trying to figure it all out.
That’s what it comes down to ultimately — its so much easier to be focused on that once you know what works. And until you have something that is actually working, it doesn’t matter.

Allison: Dude, he showed up with donuts.
Me: What? Donuts?
Allison: He said he wanted to talk things over.
Me: Did he spring for the good kind or just your standard glazed?
Allison: He went artisanal — we’re talking pineapple basil!
Me: So, what happened?
Allison: I said there was someone else; it was too late…
Based on the above excerpt, you might assume Allison and I were discussing a breakup. However, you would be mistaken.
Allison works in the marketing department of an enterprise-level company. Last week, she called to tell me her organization had ended its contract with an enterprise-level Ahrefs competitor.
FYI: I’m the CMO of Ahrefs; we sell an SEO toolkit known for housing the world’s biggest third-party database of search queries.
Ahrefs strives to be a self-serve platform; our small team of 45 individuals includes zero sales representatives.
Allison persuaded her manager to use Ahrefs because it was the better tool for the job. It didn’t hurt that it was also A LOT cheaper than the “enterprise tool” that they were using.
The sales executive showed up with gifted donuts in an attempt to salvage the account within one week of cancelation. Actually, he had a buddy tag along for moral support!
When Allison told me this story, I was blown away by how much effort our competitor put into retaining her company as a client.
Having just navigated Ahrefs’ first “enterprise courtship,” I couldn’t understand why anyone would willingly jump through the hoops involved in landing a contract over and over again.
Allow me to explain…
A few months ago, one of the world’s largest corporations contacted Ahrefs about the possibility of using our SEO toolkit.
Not only is this organization one of 30 companies included in the Dow 30, but it also boasts operations in more than 170 countries. They wanted to strike a licensing deal for the marketing department of one of their branches.
Partnering with such a reputable company seemed like a great opportunity for our bootstrapped SaaS.
Upon hearing about our potential “big fish,” I was stoked.
However, my initial enthusiasm quickly waned during the very first meeting; the Friday night, conference call included Ahrefs CEO and founder Dmitry, myself and several corporate executives.
Our questions for them were simple:
How many people in their organization would be using Ahrefs? And were all of them from the same department or were they from different branches?
Comparatively, their questions were significant:
What’s the ETA for feature X? Could they negotiate the features and the price of the “package?” Could they pay via bank transfer?
The corporation was prepared to pay a significant sum of money for our services. However, in exchange, they expected a high level of product customization, personal attention and onboarding support.
Since Dmitry and I were participating from our own homes, we immediately jumped on a private line after ending the meeting.
Turning away business is never easy, but we both agreed accommodating the requests would jeopardize resources.
Recently, we had the opportunity to speak with the CEO of a company that exclusively focuses on enterprise sales. The business also happens to work within the SEO niche.
We learned the size of their sales team, their average sales cycle, their approximate cost per lead and other insightful details that further solidified our opinion: traditional enterprise-level client courtship doesn’t work for Ahrefs.
Was their oversharing part of a bigger strategy to discourage us from tapping into enterprise sales and competing with them? I’m not sure, but it definitely influenced our decision to forgo building an enterprise sales team.
Below is a simplified overview of the steps involved with courting and landing enterprise clients. Note: I don’t recommend any of the following steps for courting romantic interests.
In this case, we were lucky — the enterprise lead approached us.
However, that’s not what happens the majority of the time. Consistently closing deals with enterprise clients requires creating and maintaining detailed lists of Fortune-500 company managers, chief technology officers and other organizational decision makers.
While cold lists can be bought for a hefty fee, gathering the specific information you need requires a fair amount of detective work.
Scouring LinkedIn profiles, attending conferences and requesting introductions from common acquaintances are common activities. Some established companies even launch their own industry events with the sole goal of attracting desired leads.
Unfortunately, establishing initial contact with your dream client is only the tip of the iceberg. You may also be expected to…
Have you convinced the prospect that your product is worth evaluating? Congratulations! You’re ready to move onto Phase 2, which often involves a series of negotiations for product adjustments.
Corporate executives are accustomed to getting what they want and can be extremely persuasive when negotiating terms of agreement.
Unfortunately, what the enterprise client wants isn’t always win-win for everyone involved. The tendency for SaaS sales and marketing departments is to be overly accommodating in hopes of closing.
“Want to eat lavender-infused chocolate on the moon? Sure, we’ll get that done for you within the next 5 years!”
Of course, enterprise clients generously pay for their requests. But do those requests align with your business model? Would you be over-committing resources to something that takes away from your “bread and butter?”
In this instance, we would have been doing exactly that. Despite the fact that our developers were already working on the requested features, we didn’t know when they would be released.
Ahrefs has thousands of paying customers waiting for all sorts of requested product improvements. Due to our limited resources, we couldn’t realistically balance both commitments.
Should you agree to their terms, expect to receive legal papers. You will wade through several sophisticated documents, consisting of more than 5 pages each.
Regularly reviewing such documents would require Ahrefs to maintain a dedicated legal team. Otherwise, we might end up agreeing to crazy unfavorable terms and be none the wiser. So, this was another huge deterrent from partnering with enterprise.
You may be surprised to learn your enterprise client has some cumbersome payment terms. It’s not uncommon for large corporations to budget specific expenses for pre-determined quarters.
Translation: Your team may do significant work upfront for little to no pay. The enterprise client will also pay by check or bank transfer. Both of these payment methods require extra processing efforts; a dedicated billing person to manage the account is recommended.
Unfortunately, the burden of training the client’s team in the new technology will rest on your shoulders. You will need to assign an account manager to ensure they are happy with the product.
After putting significant time, energy and resources into courting the client, you’ll do everything possible to keep them. Have a “churn busters team” ready with donuts, if all else fails.
Am I over-dramatizing the experience of working with enterprise clients as a small organization? I don’t think so.
Successfully executing the aforementioned steps would require doubling, maybe even tripling, our headcount. The cost of hiring these sales executives, account managers and legal experts would be astronomical. Couldn’t we just pass those costs onto the client?
Absolutely, but we would have to secure substantially more enterprise contracts to turn a worthwhile profit.
Many companies become extremely profitable by prioritizing enterprise accounts. However, they also baked the associated components needed for success into their early business models.
Conversely, Ahrefs was founded with the intention of being a self-serve business from the beginning. We believe sticking to our original plan will yield the greatest returns.
As previously mentioned, Dmitry walked away from the original deal because it wasn’t in Ahrefs’ best interest.
However, something interesting happened — the enterprise-lead from our story purchased our most expensive plan, anyways.
The company’s internal “champion advocate” was so persuasive that they decided to move forward without the dedicated account manager, customized features and bank transfers.
Champion advocates are customers who are passionate about your product’s features, capabilities and benefits. In fact, they are SO enthusiastic about their results they effortlessly convince their parent company to buy on your behalf.
The good news? Creating this kind of word-of-mouth advertising isn’t the least bit mysterious. You just prioritize three things above all else:
These three factors are the reason Ahrefs has achieved more than 60 percent YoY growth for the past 3 years alone.
I’ve spoken before about how I used to believe marketing was hard. It wasn’t until working for a product-first company I learned how easy growth could be.
When you have a phenomenal product, the best thing you can do as a marketer is teach customers how to achieve their goals with it.
The more we educate our existing consumers, and the industry at large, about how to increase their search traffic with our SEO toolkit, the more champion advocates we create — this snowball effect of PR builds over time.
People like my friend Allison become better SEOs after learning from our blog and using our software to practice their learnings.
Once your customers begin getting results, and gaining value from your product, they’re eager to pitch their bosses on your behalf. In my experience, champion advocates even volunteer to train their fellow employees.
Their product knowledge even allows them to assume leadership roles within their respective departments, thus opening the potential for promotional opportunities.
Our brief experience flirting with enterprise was enough to convince us of one thing: If your product is equally useful to both SMBs and corporates, you can succeed on your own terms.
Do you have a sales team dedicated to enterprise clients?
What do you think would happen if your organization put more effort into creating enterprise-facing product features and educational material instead?

Be the first to respond.
Imagine the following:
This is a performance and security nightmare. It is also the situation I found myself in when building a new tool for my new solo SaaS endeavour.
One of the key features of my new tool is to let anonymous users run Puppeteer scripts in a sandbox environment. Puppeteer is a project by the Google Chrome team (22k Github stars ✨ ) that allows users to run Chrome headless, as in without a screen, and automate interactions with a web page.
This is very useful for testing, web scraping, monitoring and a whole bunch of other use cases. The new tool’s purpose is that users can quickly try out these scripts without the hassle of installing and running Puppeteer on their own machines. Very similar to the JSFiddle, CodePen and other code playgrounds out there.
Key here is that the user has full access to JavaScript and Node.js , can download whatever they want from the internet and that I (well…my servers) will run that code for them! 😨 Yikes!
Here are some of the ways people (my users) can screw things up with their bits of code:
And, as we’re running a multi-tenant Saas, there are probably ways to hijack other sessions and peak into other peoples processes and code. Yes, it’s pretty nasty.
Whether this is due to malicious intent or just by writing buggy code doesn’t really matter. The end result is either slow/dead servers, your (and possibly other users) credentials on the street, and just a general bad time.
The solution to this problem that I’ve come up with is as follows.
A request to run some untrusted code is first rate limited at (1), after which it is put into an AWS SQS message queue at (2). Messages are picked up by what I call a launcher process (3) which executes the work. This is a typical fan out / master-worker pattern. The launcher preps and launches a Docker container (4) which in turn executes the user’s code inside a Node.js VM2 “soft container” (5). Let’s look at each of these steps in detail.
To avoid DDOS scenarios, where users pummel your API with HTTP requests, we need to first add rate limiting, also called request throttling. This is even more important in my specific scenario. Each lightweight HTTP request can potentially trigger a much heavier background job. (Puppeteer spins up a full Chrome browser.)
This means the API server could become unresponsive but also that the job servers could start being overwhelmed. As I’m planning to add autoscaling functionality to the job servers, more job requests equals more resource usage. This would result in ballooning servers cost. Not good for your poor solo-dev startup owner.
There are many rate limiting frameworks and plugins out there. As I’m using the Hapi.js framework, I opted for the hapi-rate-limit plugin. And there’s not much else to say about it. Install it, add it to the API routes you want protected et voilà, it just works. This plugins gives you some great options that cover a lot of rate limiting scenarios:
Furthermore, the plugin adds a couple of HTTP response headers to each request, showing the status of the rate limiting algorithm.
In the image above, you can see that I’ve made one request. This request is subtracted from the maximum amount of requests I can make per my UserPathLimit. This is defined as the number of total requests that can be made on a given path per user per period. This period resets after a while.
What happens if someone hits the rate limit? We put them in the naughty corner for a bit and serve them cheese. The motto being that the customer is always right but he/she should not be allowed to trash your system.
Delegating the the actual running of the untrusted code into background jobs is a pretty common pattern. You don’t want to tie up your HTTP server’s request cycle with long running jobs. The added benefit here is that if anything bad happens while running the untrusted code, it will not take down or otherwise compromise your customer facing API server.
In my solution, the HTTP POST request that contains the code to run is unwrapped and dumped into an SQS message queue. The message sits there until a launcher node picks the message up and attempts to process it. This is where the role of the API server ends. The motto being to never bother your user facing API server with long running and potentially dangerous requests.
Late into building this architecture, I realised I needed to split the launcher and runner code AND stick the runner into a Docker container. The reason for this becomes evident when we look at what the launcher/runner combo needs to do.
These are the tasks assigned to the launcher process:
To perform all this work, the launcher has quite a lot of privileges and needs access to a lot of credentials like AWS services, database access, file system access. All of these are attack vectors that are easy to exploit by anyone doing a console.log(.../configuration/config.json) , console.log(process.env) or something similar.
Again…yikes! 😨
This is why the untrusted code should never run in the same context as the launcher.
Stability is also increased by splitting launcher and runner. If the launcher would hang or die, the whole system effectively loses capacity. Something like the PM2 process monitor would of course restart the process, but there would certainly be noise and friction due to these crashes.
Ergo, in the current design the launcher is never directly exposed to any untrusted code. The motto being to always protect the server code, even at the expense of the user’s code.
The runner is a bit weird, let’s have a look.
The runner part of this equation is started by the launcher kicking of a Docker container which holds the runner process. The runner then executes the users untrusted code. Using a Docker container brings a couple of benefits:
Docker in general provides pretty in depth security tweaking by using the --cap-add flags described in the Runtime privilege and Linux capabilities docs. I was happy to not have to dive into the horrible mess that is selinux…
Outside of these security benefits, the Docker container also makes shipping and testing a bit easier. Getting Puppeteer to run inside a Docker environment was a bit of a challenge, requiring a lot of extra packages but there are some excellent guide lines that should help with most Debian / Ubuntu based distro’s.
The runner-inside-Docker solution is effectively a jail. But we are still allowing the inmates to use all the tools the Node.js standard library gives them to poke around. Would it not be better to severely thin out the toolbox? Yes, it is, and the first stop is Node VM.
Node VM is part of the standard Node distribution and provides sandboxing capabilities within the V8 engine: it just has a very limited interpretation of the the term “sandbox”, as in you can break out of it very easily and you can add packages and do whatever damage you want. Admittedly, the Node guys put this in big fat letters in the docs:
Luckily, there is VM2 a semi offshoot that is built to clamp down on untrusted code and the things it can run. Its main party tricks are that you can white list what modules the code injected into the VM has access to.
For example, you could white list just fs.write() but not fs.read() . Or you can block the usage of process to avoid the dreaded process.exit() or process.env . This is pretty amazing and full credit goes to @patricksimek
External packages can also be whitelisted, giving you the option to allow the use of popular packages like lodash or other utility libraries without giving users access to npm install .
We are now finally at the point where the untrusted code is executed. Using VM2 this is as simple as invoking the run() method with a stringified version of the untrusted code.
We have however one problem left. How do we get output back to the user? We are not allowing the runner inside the VM2 process inside the Docker container to have any access to a message bus or anything else outside of its context. The process is also decoupled from the launcher process, so we cannot use a simple callback.
At this moment, I solved this problem by allowing the runner to only write logging to stdout and to write images to a shielded of temporary directory which gets erased after running.
This means the launcher reads the stdout of the runner, basically parsing a long string and chopping out useful data based on prepended and appended control codes. This way the data is sanitized and passed into the upstream channels. Image files are read from disk and directly pushed to S3, taking into account file size and possible file corruption.
Running untrusted code is a bit like building a medieval castle. It is not about one, unbreakable magic gate, one deep moat or one high tower that takes care of all your woes. It’s about layers of solutions that are annoying enough to scare of intruders and catch the mistakes of the layer above or below it.

SaaS models are great due to the recurring revenue and high product margins, but one fixed cost excluded from the margin analysis is ongoing development expense. Building out, maintaining, and upgrading a technology stack requires a constant commitment to developers and engineers, so what is an appropriate level of development or R&D expense for a successful SaaS business? We looked at 73 publicly traded SaaS businesses at the time of IPO and 2 years prior to get a sense for how successful SaaS businesses allocate to R&D. The raw data and observations are below:
R&D spend is 23% of revenue. Leading up to the IPO, SaaS companies spent on median 23% of revenue on R&D. As you can see there is almost no deviation between the financials reported at IPO and 2 years prior. For many of these companies, they were in their Series B or Series C two years prior to IPO, so it’s safe to say that spending a quarter of revenue on R&D is the right level for a SaaS business even at earlier stages. No matter where your SaaS business is in its lifecycle, as one founder put it to me, “managing a large and growing stack for a cloud application is damn tough” so you’re going to be spending materially on the stack no matter how fast you’re growing or how mature you are.
Median spend is $19mm. The median level of revenue at IPO for these SaaS businesses was $96mm so with 23% of revenue going to R&D, that means R&D spend was $19mm on median at the time of IPO. That’s a lot of dev talent.
The range of spend is wide. Hortonworks and Castlight spent more on R&D than they generated in revenue, with R&D/revenue of 110% and 117% respectively. On the other end, Paycom software spent only 2% of revenue on R&D, and that business did $108mm in revenue prior to IPO.
Smaller businesses spend more. Not surprisingly, given the fixed cost nature of R&D, the 10 smallest companies by revenue spent 41% of revenue on R&D while the 10 largest spent 24%, closer to the overall median. Smaller businesses are likely going to have to expend a larger percent of revenue on R&D than their more mature peers. Note that those smaller businesses are faster growing, with average revenue growth of 127% for the 10 smallest on the list versus 47% for the 10 largest.

Your success as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company is completely dependent on acquiring and keeping users in your product. But if you’re using traditional marketing tactics, you’re likely struggling to scale your business quickly. That’s because conventional marketing techniques focus on engaging prospects and users outside of the product.
It’s far more efficient and effective to drive adoption and usage from inside the product.
In other words, to use your product to acquire, retain, and grow your user base. That’s precisely the secret to the meteoric rise and industry success of companies including Dropbox, Slack, and Atlassian.
As the SaaS business model becomes par for the course, your survival depends on delivering personalized in-product customer experience. Doing so requires a deep understanding of and ability to influence user behaviors inside your product. It also requires a completely new product-led go-to-market (GTM) strategy that guides marketing, sales, customer success, and product teams to put customers front and center.
This book shows you how to transition to a product-led GTM, put in place all necessary elements, and capitalize on your product as a primary go-to-market channel.
SaaS Product Managers Must Overthrow Traditional Marketing
If you are a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product manager whose company relies on a traditional go-to-market (GTM) strategy, you’ve got your work cut out for you. That’s because a traditional GTM rooted in engaging prospective and existing customers through marketing channels is useless when it comes to the in-product user experience. And that makes it incredibly difficult for you to ensure that users not only try but keep using your product over time. Fortunately, a new approach and GTM strategy centered on the product has been proven to effectively drive user adoption and revenue growth at scale.
medium.com
The New Path to SaaS Company Success
I know why and how Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies are stymied as they try to quickly and effectively scale their businesses. And my insights are based on firsthand experience founding and driving business growth at a SaaS company that was ultimately acquired by Marketo. Even multi-billion dollar SaaS companies like Marketo can face the same challenges as any SaaS startup. Delivering intrinsic value to their customers while operating in a competitive market. Success comes down to whether customers will recognize this value. The key is delivering an engaging experience throughout the customer lifecycle.
medium.com
Going forward, delivering a personalized, in-product customer experience will be crucial for every Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company. Such an approach enables companies to build a competitive advantage and optimize how they drive revenue, customer acquisition cost (CAC) efficiency, renewals, and intelligent product development decisions. Those companies that excel by harnessing digital transformation will find themselves standing apart in the market.
The Third Wave of SaaS — Focused on Customer Experience
Digital transformation has brought all businesses online, so even though Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses are already digital and service-based, they now need to prioritize the customer experience to succeed. Fortunately, digital transformation makes it possible for companies to reimagine that experience and more efficiently and effectively engage users and customers in the product. In a world where frictionless experiences are on the rise, forward-thinking (SaaS) companies are reinventing themselves with a user-centric, in-product approach that spans the customer lifecycle.
www.mykpono.com
It’s All About What Happens in the Product
Word of a bad customer experience can spread quickly and send Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies on a downward spiral. But meaningful, memorable customer experiences can rapidly lead to growth and even market domination. As is true with consumer products, customer interactions, and behaviors with an enterprise product are fundamental to delivering better customer experience. That’s why a growing number of SaaS companies offer self-service freemium products and free trials. By doing so, they gain insight into how users explore, navigate, and actually use their product. And that provides every department and process across the organization with the fuel needed to deliver a personalized in-product customer experience.
www.mykpono.com
To deliver great customer experiences today, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies must understand the full customer lifecycle, unify customer data, and track their customers’ personal journey through their products. This is only possible with a product-led go-to-market (GTM) strategy that centers on providing access to the product earlier in the buying cycle (via free trials or freemium). To succeed with this approach, SaaS companies must align their marketing, sales, product, and customer success departments around relevant goals and metrics. Then they must equip them with the right tools and data to deliver personalized experiences that advance prospects and customers from one stage to the next.
Nurture and Personalize Based on Product Usage
The subscription economy has changed the customer acquisition model to one providing the immediate option to sign up for a product freemium or free trial. Allowing prospects to try a product improves the buying experience and provides Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies with relevant behavioral data that helps them further personalize that experience.
www.mykpono.com
Organizing Around the Buying Journey
Most Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies focus on their sales process, not the customer’s buying journey. When companies use a customer lifecycle framework rather than a product lifecycle or marketing/sales funnel, they can re-evaluate their own processes to ensure that organizational goals are aligned with customer needs and expectations. This framework enables companies to use in-product behaviors to deliver relevant experiences to each user, which helps acquire, retain, and grow the customer base.
www.mykpono.com
Getting to Initial Product Value
Instead of looking at just part of a transaction or experience, the customer journey documents the full experience of being a customer. In-product customer journeys are the most effective way for prospective customers to experience true value from the product as they move along their customer lifecycle. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies must carefully design the journey toward realizing initial value as it is one of the most important journeys. The shorter the time to initial value, the more likely it is that a prospect will stay long enough to become a customer.
www.mykpono.com
Aligning Around Customer Lifetime Value
Many Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies are still organized around a complex go-to-market (GTM) and sales process divided among specialized departments: marketing, sales, and customer success. To deliver a personalized customer experience, companies need to incorporate the product department into the GTM and customer acquisition process. They must align goals around the customer experience, prioritize the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) metric across departments, and find a way to aggregate customer data across multiple technologies. By taking these steps, SaaS companies are better positioned to design and deliver personalized customer engagements.
www.mykpono.com
Moving from Marketing Qualified to Product Qualified Leads
As the product becomes a channel for acquiring, retaining, and growing customers, the traditional go-to-market (GTM) strategy fundamentally changes. Instead of driving prospects to lead forms, a product-led GTM strategy drives prospects to sign up for a product or free trial. Rather than generating marketing qualified leads (MQLs), all departments focus on delivering product qualified leads (PQLs) to create sales-ready accounts and more active customers.
www.mykpono.com
To succeed with a product-led go-to-market (GTM) strategy, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies must adapt their processes, tactics, and metrics to support a customer focus. Following the suggestions and guidance in this section will help companies establish a solid foundation for their new approach.
Defining a New Customer Acquisition Process
While a product-led approach impacts every part of a go-to-market (GTM) strategy, it has a transformational effect on the customer acquisition process. Developing an effective product-led GTM strategy requires companies to analyze four must-have elements that come together to form the new customer acquisition process. By optimizing this process, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies can reach ideal customers in a scalable, repeatable, and profitable way.
www.mykpono.com
Putting the Foundation in Place
With a product-led go-to-market (GTM) strategy, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies approach the four major phases of the customer lifecycle — acquisition, adoption, retention, and expansion — in a new way. To support this approach, they need to design their free trial process or freemium offer, create onboarding experiences, drive prospects to try their product, reach product qualified leads, and convert them to customers. One of the most important steps is deciding whether a freemium or free trial is the best option for the company.
www.mykpono.com
Embracing Organization-Wide Accountability for Customer Success
With a product-led approach, customer success accountability spans the entire customer lifecycle and is supported by cross-functional teams, including product, marketing, sales, and customer success. By combining efforts and following best practices, these teams can improve their customer retention and expansion efforts.
www.mykpono.com
Laying the Groundwork for Scalable, Repeatable Customer Acquisition
A product-led go-to-market (GTM) strategy is focused on optimizing the customer acquisition process through personalized customer experiences and engagements. Designing those personalized customer experiences the right way is key to scaling and making the customer acquisition process more repeatable. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies can achieve this by combining customer segmentation, customer journeys, and nurturing.
www.mykpono.com
Calling Upon New Playbooks
A product-led go-to-market (GTM) strategy requires a complete alignment of product, marketing, sales, and customer success teams in an organization. These teams have to adjust their playbooks to successfully deliver personalized customer experiences based on in-product behavior and usage patterns.
www.mykpono.com
Prioritize PQLs, CLV, and CAC
A product-led approach changes the focus of what and how Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies measure success and effectiveness. It replaces marketing qualified leads (MQLs) and sales qualified leads (SQLs) with product qualified leads (PQLs). Moreover, it enables teams to track and measure in-product customer behaviors and correlate them with crucial SaaS metrics such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).
www.mykpono.com
Data, Engagement, and Experimentation
A product-led go-to-market (GTM) strategy is the most effective way for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies to deliver personalized customer experiences that are essential for long-term growth and success. Delivering these experiences hinges on the ability to assemble and manage a 360-degree view of customer data, and engage in real-time and consistently on all channels. It also requires the ability to experiment at scale so the company can accelerate how it learns and adapts to customer needs.
www.mykpono.com
Becoming Customer Focused, Experience-Driven and Product Led
Today the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model is par for the course. Delivering a personalized customer experience is critical for SaaS company survival, and the transition to a product-led go-to-market (GTM) gives organizations the best chance to succeed. Those SaaS companies that understand what customers are trying to achieve, how they buy, and what experience they want from the product will transform to become truly customer-focused, truly experience-driven, and truly product-led.

This post originally appeared on the PlainFlow Blog
SaaS products represent the building blocks of a huge part of today’s B2B technologies. The ability to understand the impact of new consumer-facing technologies it’s more important than ever. This brings a lot of new challenges also for people who are not directly involved in software. This post is a walkthrough in how startups use Modern SaaS Stack (Marketing/Support/Sales) along with their journeys from day-0. How they adjust their product/marketing strategies based on new technologies. How they measure (or don’t measure) the impact of those technologies on their customers’ experiences.
You can read the a follow-up to this post here: AI implications on Marketing and Analytics.
As Clement Vouillon stated in the Evolution of The SaaS Stack back when software was only “on-premise” only huge players was dominating the market landscape. For startups that were getting started, there weren’t so many available options. Was more a take it or leave it.
In a few years, the market saw an important shift and the SaaS model started to make sense for IT business. This reflected into a huge proliferation of SaaS startups vertical on specific needs. Those startups with fewer resources were able to build better products and deliver better customer experiences. This is where startups started to adopt other startups’ products.
The market landscape kept evolving fast: new communications channel, new advertising platforms, new ways to talk to your customers, different ways to get new users. Until the moment where each company department adopted its own stack of SaaS products. With certain exceptions, this is now the standard.
This where products like Segment.com come up to the stage and SaaS hubs started to grow. The main purpose was to bridge the distances between products and external pieces of software with zero-effort by developers and engineers.
Let’s recap: first, you choose the SaaS products that better suits your needs, second you connect the best products each other, third you’re able to offer the best customer experience. So far, so good!
Each SaaS product in your stack that interacts at any level with your customers is producing data. Pure Email Marketing Software, mobile and browser notifications software, Ads platform, customer support and CRM software, etc. Every time your customers interact with one of these channels — powered by a specific SaaS in your stack — you’re generating data. How big is that data-hole? It depends on you how many touch-points your customers have when interact with your brand.
With such products fragmentations comes data-fragmentation that leads to a massive amount of unexploited data.
To frame and better understand these ideas in a real world use case we’ll do a quick thought experiment. Let’s suppose you’re the founder of a SaaS product. Next month you will finish your public beta and you already have a few customers.
You only have one product launch. You better be prepared for that. What do you use for support on day 0? No jokes, email is a good idea you only need an alias that sounds like support@$name.com. What about email newsletter updates? MailChimp is probably the best thing you can get a very affordable price. Buffer also sounds a pretty option for $10/mo. For marketing, support and Sales you won’t need anything as your main focus is the product.
How do you collect data? At this stage, your data collection infrastructure might be very rudimental. An OLTP system for transactions, OLAP for analytics processing and a different tool for clickstream data, something like Google Analytics (at its full potential with GTM) or Mixpanel.
It’s been 6 months now and you did great. You’ve started as a Single Page Application (SAP), now you’re also releasing the first version of a mobile app. You now have 10 new emails/week from customers: you need a more structured tool for support like GrooveHQ. Same for sales, it’s time to get a basic CRM (Zoho CRM might fit your needs).
You have been using MailChimp for sending newsletter update emails. Now you will probably need to add something to send transactional email. Postmark or Mandrill are two available alternatives. You will also probably start doing some rudimental experiment on Adwords and Facebook Ads. Plus, you’re sending mobile notifications using Firebase.
This is what your Stack might look like in 6 months after launch.
Now let’s see the data side of the coin! Your data infrastructure is still composed of OLAP, OLTP, and clickstream data (Google Analytics/Mixpanel). You’re growing at a good rate and you need start answer questions at a deeper level to take better decisions. After all, you’re data-driven right?
What questions you want to answer:
The reality is much more complex that you think. The following is a common path that your user might have on your product:
User Interaction #1: Users signs-up to your productUser Interaction #2, #3: He views a bunch of pagesUser Interaction #4: He creates a pre-sales Zendesk ticket and leave the siteUser Interaction #5: He clicks on an email he receivesUser Interaction #6: He visits the siteUser Interaction #7: He makes a purchase
Yes, you think you have a perfect connected SaaS stack, but how deep is that connection? And how can you get the answers to those questions? A widely adopted solution: dump data from each integration (5 in this case) in your stack: GrooveHQ, Adwords, Facebook Ads, Firebase, Mailchimp and mashup with your OLAP, OLTP, and clickstream data with some python/R scripts to gains insights.
Yes, you can still manage it but it’s getting harder.
Things are going well, your company is scaling and so your team’s operations. You’ve dropped MailChimp and switched to a full Marketing Automation platform: HubSpot. Now you have 30 new tickets/day (from customers and not) coming for different reasons: pre-sales questions, post-sales questions, feature requests, bug-fix etc. It’s time for you to get Zendesk, Typeform (or SurveyMonkey) for your survey.
Your marketing team started to send stickers to customers (via StickerMule) and added a monitoring software (Mention). You added Adroll as a retargeting platform to your Stack and Urban Airship for browser notifications.
Back to the data-side: your data infrastructure is still composed by OLAP, OLTP, and clickstream data (Google Analytics/Mixpanel).
You are probably now storing everything (OLAP and OLTP data plus clickstream data) on BI columnar database like Amazon RedShift.
But when it comes down to pull insights from your SaaS integrations you have still have to have the old checklist:
And here’s the big big picture:
This is where the discrepancy between the volume of data collected and the accuracy of the decisions becomes big. It’s really easy to say you’re data-driven, it’s really hard being so.
This is where PlainFlow comes in. PlainFlow is a Customer Data Platform that lets you design customers’ journeys and trigger actions based on activities and behaviors users had when using your product. Have a consistent way to reach out to your customers across many different channels like Facebook Messenger, Push notifications, Emails, Web Notification and, Slack.

Don’t expect people to buy your product unless it is truly revolutionary. Not at first, anyway. When you start your SaaS business, you’ll soon discover that you’re just another product in the universe of fast-paced tech and innovative ideas. Starting out, not many might recognize your company’s name or what you do, so your first job is to get your name out there. There are enough methods to market a SaaS product, from affiliate partnerships and paid advertising, through content marketing and active outreach to media outlets. Experiment with a combination of these methods. Pay close attention to what works for you and know that it might change with time.
Start by signing up your friends and family. We all start the same way. You don’t need to employ any fancy marketing or tech-savviness to reach them. Ask them to provide you feedback on their experience. While this feedback won’t necessarily be unbiased, it will nonetheless be wide-ranging, real, and often insightful. These are people who will be willing to spend time carefully thinking about their feedback and delving deeper into the conversations. This is not meant to counter the Lean Startup ‘iterate quickly with customer feedback’ advice. Instead, this is an acknowledgment that there are different types of feedback to look into based on your development stage.
If you’re new to the SaaS Product world, content creation is your best friend. Start a blog and write content that speaks to the people who need or might want your product. It’s a great way to grab attention to your brand and product while building you as an authority in your desired space. With a well-run blog, you can pitch your solution and receive immediate feedback, discover and develop relationships within your market, establish yourself as a thought leader and increase your online search-ability. To provide great content, you don’t have to be a great writer. Start generating content and monitor the kind of response you get. Just make sure your articles are in-depth and bring value. At the same time, don’t expect instant results. Running a blog will take a lot of time and effort. Even so, today it’s particularly important for SaaS companies to do content marketing, and it’s even relatively affordable. It’s a marketing strategy that has seen huge growth over the past decade.
A great way to get started doing marketing is to launch a beta product. It’s also a good way to learn before the real thing is out there. Build a beta version of your app or software and get it released once it’s bug-free and fully-functioning. Too many SaaS companies delay their launch by continuously adding features they ‘want’ before they release the first version. Once it’s in a usable and respectable form, get it to market and let your beta users provide you feedback and help shape the future of the software. There are a lot of advantages to opening up the service in beta. There will be issues, bugs, unnecessarily complicated user flows, and poorly worded text. With the beta, you’re telling people that the product isn’t done and asking them to be patient with you. It’s also a request for feedback and an opportunity to create awareness.
Not all press will care about or even be willing to cover beta products. A lot of the mainstream press will want to write about services which are fully live, have scaled, and are important in the marketplace. However, there are a bunch of sites that like to cover the leading edge, meaning cover betas.
Doing your PR is a good idea to start with, whether or not you’ve got the budget. After all, nobody knows your business better than you do. You can also spend some time participating in relevant online communities. Start commenting on relevant blog posts, participate in relevant discussion groups, and work on your own blog. Find out where your prospective customers hang out online and work to get coverage in those areas.
There are too many different ways to do your marketing, and it’s not feasible to do them all, especially when you’re just getting started. However, you won’t know what works for you, unless you try it. Try them, see how each works for you, and then pick the best performing of the lot. When it comes to marketing, you must try and stretch your budget to a few different advertising channels. Don’t drop all your eggs in one basket. This way, you can tell which marketing channel is giving you the most value. And track your ‘conversions’ to find out which marketing channel has the best conversion rate. A good online campaign should include social media advertising, paid search engine advertising, email marketing, and a PR campaign.
This holds true even for a SaaS company. A lot of SaaS companies are sending stickers, or small “thank you” presents to their best or most loyal customers. The last stage in a SaaS product pre-launch stage is the beta stage. By sharing their feedback, early adopters have shaped the future of your product and your business. Make sure you reward them for their time and effort.
You still need to onboard customers to your app, no matter how simple the first version of your SaaS will be. Chances are the newcomers will stay and convert into paying customers in the future if you do it well.
While you’re launching, your mind is probably gravitating towards itching to make the proverbial million dollars. Resist the temptation, don’t chase money and instead re-focus on building value for a million customers. Don’t allow the huge numbers to distract you. Start small. Begin by creating real value for your initial ten customers, then for the next hundred, and keep moving up like that. When you do a great job, your fans will do the rest of the work by bringing in more people, and money will naturally follow. It starts by creating a smooth onboarding process, by taking the call when your customers have a problem, and emailing back soon when they ask you a question, making it a priority to be transparent and publicly apologizing for the mistakes you made and inconveniences you created. All this counts as value. Being responsive and retaining your personal touch is potentially how you can beat bigger, better-funded, more established competitors.
All companies that inhabit the same space are competing aggressively for attention. But great products, with a strong team behind them, sell themselves. The reason certain products are considered great is that they focus on making their customers successful. So, if you’ve built a great product, half your marketing job is done. Good luck.

Be the first to respond.
Hi there, we’re Point Nine Capital a VC firm focused on SaaS and marketplaces. If you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our Medium channel.
As a VC firm focused on both SaaS and marketplaces, we have not only witnessed the rise of the “SaaS enabled marketplace” hybrid model (SEM in the rest of the post) but also invested in several of them [Docplanner, Eversports, Deskbookers, Styleseat, Xeneta, Infakt]. Through our deal flow and our deep dives we encounter many of these startups in a variety of verticals and industries. This is why we wanted to share an overview of this fragmented landscape and make our approach transparent.
From our point of view, a SaaS enabled marketplace is a business which combines the characteristics of both models:
This “methodology” has been popularly described as “Come for the tool, stay for the network.” by Chris Dixon and SEMs are in the perfect position to embrace such an approach.
SaaS enabled marketplaces can be B2B, B2C or C2C and the SaaS component can be offered to the demand or / and to the supply side whether it’s a business or a consumer.
These companies also combine the business models of marketplace and SaaS as they can monetize the transaction through a fee or the SaaS component through a subscription. Mathias modeled the different options in the following diagram:
When we set ourselves the goal of mapping out the SEM landscape, we first and foremost embraced the process and the exercise. It was clear from the start that we couldn’t come up with an exhaustive list of all existing players in every vertical. Our main aim with this post is to give the community a first overview of the main SEM verticals and players, as well as sharing some lessons we have learned.
We’re planning to update our map in the months to come, in the meantime if you want to get on our radar just fill out this form:
In addition to the map here are some findings that we wanted to share with you. Please feel free to add your own thoughts in the comment section below — we’d love to read them!
A first observation we made while mapping this ecosystem is that there are 3 scenarios when it comes to SaaS enabled marketplaces:
These scenarios reflect really well the maturity of the overall tech ecosystem. As people and businesses are increasingly used to working with SaaS and to buying / selling goods or services on marketplaces the line between the two models is blurring and many products integrate both:
Another interesting finding is that for some verticals it was extremely easy to find SaaS enabled marketplaces while for some others it was very challenging.
In general, we found more players in verticals that were already mature in terms of pure marketplace and SaaS players. Allow us to clarify that point with some examples.
For instance, we had no problem finding SEMs for the “Travel & Tourism” or for the “Professional Services” verticals. If you want to book a flight, a hotel or want to find a plumber there’s a high chance that you’ll first search online. And this search will probably lead you to a comparison engine, a booking marketplace or an online listing.
In these instances going online and browsing listings has become a habit for both users and professionals. There’s no market education to be done.
The more mature a vertical has become, the more competitive it gets and the more pressure there is for suppliers to perform well. In such environments the SaaS enabled marketplace model very often emerges to help them perform better.
For example many of the SEMs we’ve listed in the two verticals mentioned above offer professionals not only plenty of features to manage their bookings (from simple calendars to complete booking systems) but also marketing features with ranking optimization, dynamic pricing, yield management, off- and on-platform-promotion etc. and even CRM or invoicing features. Providing just an online listing is not enough, established marketplace operators must provide additional added-value through a SaaS-component.
At the other end of the spectrum some industries, like Agriculture or Construction, haven’t (yet) reached the same level of maturity and we couldn’t discover as many SaaS enabled marketplaces.
To that end, the SEM model seems like a natural evolution of the marketplace and SaaS models which are “merging” their strengths into the same product.
On our map you’ll find every type of SEM possible: B2B, B2C and C2C. Concerning the SaaS component there are 2 main aspects that we want to highlight:
The first point seems obvious; the non-professional-users of these marketplaces generally don’t need — or want — to use a software tool to manage the transaction, in the vast majority of the cases they just want to buy something as fast as possible.
A notable exception to this situation is when these consumers are on the “supply”-side of the marketplace (the first “C” of C2C marketplaces), then they need SaaS-features to manage the good or service they sell. For example Livementor is an education platform that enables anybody to give online classes and hence offer a tool, in parallel of their marketplace, that helps tutors better manage their activity.
Which leads us to the second aspect — in most cases the SaaS-features we identified were built for the “supply”-side of the marketplace for use cases like.:
To conclude on the SaaS component aspect it’s worth noting that vertical SEMs are, obviously, more deeply integrated compared to horizontal SEMs. Ex: Yardbook, a SEMs for landscaping businesses, has specific features which are useful only for this particular type of business.
As we’ve seen above some verticals are more crowded in terms of SaaS enabled marketplaces than others. But, when we were exploring these verticals we could notice that many of them had very interesting and fast growing new segments.
This is, for example, the case for the Real Estate vertical. In this category you’ll find plenty of large, well funded players (Zillow, Opendoor…) but at the same time there are plenty of startups which are innovating on growing use cases like B2B short-term rental of retail spaces (flash retailing).
This shows us that even in crowded verticals there are still plenty of opportunities to deploy SaaS enabled marketplaces (which we would love to hear from!).

Three months ago I joined an early-stage tech startup called Forest. Everyone in the team does his best to make operations more efficient. Like many people, we hate reinventing the wheel.
Here is the list of tools we use on a daily basis. You may be familiar with most of them. Yet I hope you can still make some interesting discoveries.
I like to keep this list up-to-date and assess the value we get from each tool. Let’s get started:
Trello helps us organize and act on todo lists as team. Business and development teams use it to work together on weekly sprints or the long-term roadmap. We like the UI, designed to make users feel as if they were directly writing on post-it notes and moving them around a board.
Calendly is a nice tool that we use to schedule meetings or calls with customers or leads. Every team member can setup his availabilities and share his own Calendly link to another person. This person will then be able to pick her most convenient time directly in our calendar. This saves us a few minutes of back-and-forth exchanges to find a convenient time slot. And we no longer need to think about time zones issues.
We use Google Calendar to schedule meetings or calls with users and all our business partners. A typical use case for us is scheduling a customer support call or a product demo via email and Calendly. Once the meeting is in scheduled, we can rely on notifications to be sure we never miss a call.
Google Drive is where we store, share and edit documents. We use it to collaborate on documents, keep history of all modifications and avoid losing documents.
Google Docs are great for many reasons. We don’t have to install softwares on our laptops and we don’t need to worry about different versions on different machines. And it’s natively integrated in Google Drive.
Github is a platform for code version control and collaboration. Our development team uses it on a daily basis to save edits to our code or make code reviews. Having our code on Github makes it possible for other people to contribute to our open-source projects by suggesting additions or fixes. Being on Github gives us the possibility to interact with the open-source community, while staying in the same place for our private repositories.
Forest is a modern admin interface that can be plugged into any app. It saves time for developers and allows teams to interact with application data in an efficient way. We’re building Forest while using it as our own admin interface. Among other things, we use Forest to get informations about our new and existing users, track and display the activity on our platform (KPIs) on our live dashboard or manage payments via the Stripe integration.
Slack is our #1 way to communicate within the team. We use it extensively to quickly share informations about things we’re currently working on, ask questions to other team members or simply chat together. We also use it for customer support (in combination with Drift) or ordering our lunch thanks to the many integrations to third-party services made possible with Slack’s API.
Drift is a tool that provides any website with a live chat. This is very useful for customer support and increasing engagement. We set up an integration with Slack so that we get notified every time a visitor is looking for help, and we can answer him directly via Slack. Visitors can also give more informations about them directly via Drift to make the support even more efficient.
Screenhero is a nice tool to share your screen with someone else. While you can do this with other tools such as Skype, Screenhero adds the possibility to let several people performing actions real-time on one computer. This is especially helpful for debugging sessions among developers working together remotely.
Skype is our #1 way to call people outside the team. We use it to touch base with customers or demo our product. The convenient aspect of Skype is that almost everyone has a Skype account. It also allows us to create a list of useful contacts that we can join any time.
Gmail is our email client. We use it for all communications that do not require an instant response. We integrated it with many other tools, such as Prospect.io, Close.io or Calendly.
If you’re reading this article, you probably know about Medium. I firmly believe that writing and sharing one’s learnings and experience is a meaningful activity and great use of one’s time. Additionally, publishing useful content has numerous unexpected benefits: new opportunities, new ideas or interactions with people you would not have connected with otherwise.
There are many tricks to find someone’s email or verifying that an email does exists. Hunter is one of them and comes as a Chrome extension. When visiting a website or a user profile on LinkedIn, this extension can automatically find the email of people mentioned on the page. It gives us the option to save emails in different lists that can be exported later. Obviously this does not work every time (Hunter provides you with a confidence percentage), but it often saves a lot of time.
An efficient strategy to generate leads in B2B businesses is cold emailing. Prospect.io is a tool that allows you to schedule mail campaigns. It will automatically send emails to your lists of prospects. You can schedule a series of emails that will be sent until a prospect answer you. Be sure to select relevant prospects and be careful not to end up spamming people!
One missing feature that we would love to see is thread emails: the possibility to send follow-up emails that stack into the same mail thread. This would make the follow-up less intrusive and more human.
Close.io is a CRM with clean UI and minimum features to get sales operations done in an efficient way. We use it to keep track of everything we’re doing when communicating with leads or customers. We customized the tool to match our own sales strategy. For example, we designed a set of status to follow how each lead is moving in our sales pipe, from potential user to paying customer or dead opportunity.
Stripe is a convenient tool that provides our app with a payment system. It enables our customers to subscribe to our service for a monthly fee. This means we don’t need to code the complex parts of an hand-made payment system and can instead focus on building more interesting features for our product.
Spendesk makes it easy for us to make payments as a company, without having to provide an Amex to each team member or spend time managing expenses. It generates a corporate e-card for our payments and has a convenient built-in approval workflow.
We use Segment as unique tool to collect data from our users. Data is then streamed to other marketing integrations, such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel or Drift. This allows us to take advantage of those other tools without worrying about integrating multiple ways to gather data.
We use Mixpanel to get information about events triggered by our visitors and better understand the way we convert visitors into active users and paying customers.
Google Analytics is a convenient solution to get data about websites traffic. We use it to get information such as where our users come from before landing on our site or how many users visited our website on a given day.

Top highlight
Starting your own business is not as easy as you might think, especially when it comes to the SaaS sphere. Building a startup from the ground is quite challenging. But if you are an ambitious entrepreneur, these obstacles won’t discourage you.
You might have noticed that SaaS has been topping the lists of the best business models for several years now. That’s why SaaS startups are at the pinnacle of success. This model has been adopted by big companies like Google, Apple, IBM, Adobe, and small businesses alike. In this post, we will share our experiences of creating SaaS business, and analyze SaaS product ideas based on the existing successful services.
Before we move on to discussing the most effective business ideas, we should clarify the basics. Software-as-a-Service business hosts a platform online and provides users with access to its functionality, technical support, and additional services on a subscription basis. Users typically access the software remotely.
The software is not just a product in this case — the company takes long-term responsibility for maintaining databases, servers, and additional software that enable the functionality to run smoothly over time, providing continuous services to subscribed members.
The price of the subscription and the offer details vary depending on the number of users that have access to a profile (single versus team plans), SaaS customer support details, the amount of stored data, or availability of additional services.
Software as a Service mostly works in the B2B domain, connecting business owners to useful tools that help them improve their performance. However, some products are oriented on business-to-customer (B2C) niches, although these are rare occasions.
However, if you lack inspiration and have no slightest idea of how to start, look at our tips. They might help you find motivation.
The real estate business has lots of issues to be considered. So the development of a worthy property management SaaS platform might be a great idea. You can develop a multi-featured platform, which will be focused on building lease documents, collecting rent, managing a portfolio, user administration, etc.
Customer relationship management software is a popular tool modern companies can’t do without. Its key mission is to unite different departments of the same company in one system and boost the performance. Such web tools help organize your notes, metrics, and other activities in one system.
The majority of high-quality tools are hosted in the cloud. Regardless of the fact that the modern market is overloaded with such solutions, it would be a great idea for your business. There are lots of options, but it is challenging to find the right one. You can analyze the existing tools, weigh their pros and cons, and develop your own product.
Dealing with hundreds of financial reports is a time-sapping task. Some team members need to contact all the vendors to check the payment statuses. To boost their productivity, you can create a SaaS platform, allowing businesses to upload reports within a few minutes.
Such financial tools are in demand today, so it is one of the greatest SaaS business ideas, which will definitely help your customers be more effective!
Business owners understand that their employees need to be aware of the latest trends. If you are a professional in the cloud computing area, you can develop your platform that can be used to train employees. The SaaS area is too broad. So you can narrow down the topic and create your own courses for employees. To sell such courses, you can contact different organizations working in this sphere and offer your services.
Sales tracking is a compulsory task for any company that deals with sales on an ongoing basis. It is quite cumbersome to do this manually. If you are an expert in this area, you can develop a sales tracking app. It will help users automate a variety of processes and sales tasks.
Also, it will be great if your app can offer a set of reporting options. It is tough to find a sales tracking app that will perfectly meet the needs of a sales team. To create the best tool, you can analyze the market, compare the best apps, and offer your own, perfect solution!
Blogging is not only a hobby; it is a good source of income today. If you are a professional in this niche and want to share your experience with others, you can start your own blog about SaaS. You can cover a variety of topics in your blog, ranging from enterprise technology to software development to artificial intelligence. Doing so, you’ll keep your readers informed about the latest trends in this area.
If your blog is interesting, you have chances to establish yourself as an expert in this field. After that, you can make money through either Google AdSense or advertisement of other services in your blog.
It is safe to say that modern marketing is impossible without social networking sites. LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook are superb advertising tools that allow business owners to reach their customers faster. However, they need to monitor the content in order to understand what posts perform well. So, you can create a service that will help gather all these insights and show the statistics over all platforms.
When analyzing all SaaS product ideas, we couldn’t omit this one. This business niche is at the pinnacle of success today. It is not overloaded with solutions. If you are an expert in this field, you can develop a universal payment system which can support a variety of payment methods (credit/debit cards, bank transfers, mobile carrier billings, etc.) If your new project can help vendors solve a number of financial issues, it will become profitable.
SaaS business ideas attract users with their flexibility. Unlike a one-time purchase, the expenses are spread through longer periods, allowing users to test out the service before paying for its full price. Also, users can choose plans of different complexity, determining how much functionality they need without overcomplicating the interface.
Statistics show that the global cost of the SaaS industry will amount to 55 billion dollars in 2026. Software-as-a-Service business models developed into various kinds and entered many niches. Let’s take a look at the main ways to apply SaaS scalable business ideas to real businesses.
Also known as PaaS, this business model relies on a cloud service where providers create the environment for web and mobile development. The company takes full responsibility for infrastructure, data servers, computer networks, security. Providers, therefore, need to be equipped with powerful hardware, since they will be the ones accommodating the backend operations of all their clients.
Examples
PaaS allows business owners to develop websites, mobile apps, and online stores quickly, test their solutions on different OS, and work with many development languages in a single environment. The relationships with clients are usually very long-term — a single client can use the service for 5–10 years, as long as the online business is active — so even a few customers can bring in considerable profits.
Such startups offer B2B platforms that handle a particular aspect of business owners’ activities. Unlike PaaS, they strive to provide a service, not development infrastructure. On such startups, business owners can automate certain business processes (marketing, sales, email marketing), create documentation, manage existing data, and collaborate with teams.
Examples
The next development vector for SaaS startups is inter-connection. In a few years, businesses are likely to be integrated — users will freely transfer data from multiple SaaS, creating a universal working environment.
CRM systems have been available on a subscription basis for quite a while. According to Gartner, SaaS spending accounts for about 75% of the overall CRM market. Subscription-based platforms appeal to clients with their low-risk policies, quick deployment options, availability, and mobility. All data on customer relations, sales, marketing is stored on the Cloud server and can be accessed anytime and from any device.
Examples
CRM SaaS business mostly targets small companies — their limited functionality can’t deliver the needs of big corporations — but there are premium plans for bigger companies as well. In the future, big companies will likely transfer to subscription-based CRM solutions, too — it’s the most prominent solution on the market right now.
SaaS business model’s main advantage is a low entrance barrier. Small teams, consisting of one or two members, can build, deploy, and promote a micro-SaaS platform, and create a decent revenue stream.
Examples
Micro-SaaS platforms are products that cover a very narrow niche, allowing them to perform a very specific task — email marketing optimization, keyword analysis for SEO, etc. Sometimes, they are available on the website or can be downloaded as add-ons to existing bigger SaaS. One of the common software startup ideas is a browser extension — the mini-solution is integrated directly into the browser’s functionality.
The majority of SaaS solutions are focused on automation, allowing users to outsource manual work to algorithms. AI allows enabling efficient automation, letting clients make the most out of their time. Incorporating machine learning into SaaS became so popular that it formed into an established industry — Machine Learning as a Service — which is predicted to be worth 20.8 billion dollars by 2025.
Examples
AI can assist with processing large amounts of data, mimicking human behavior (helpful in marketing and sales), personalizing offers, and securing operations. MLaaS can be integrated into customer service tools, chatbots, marketing platforms, sales solutions, and recognition systems. Any niche that can benefit from automation will also profit from working with Artificial Intelligence.
Blockchain, a technology behind cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, and smart contracts, is a system where the data on a transaction, made in digital currency, is stored among several devices in a peer-to-peer network. It’s a decentralized technology — instead of saving all the information on a single server, the data is distributed among hundreds or thousands of devices.
Examples
Blockchain as a service businesses focus on providing blockchain infrastructure to other users and companies. Business owners don’t have to create a custom network — they can use the provider’s blockchain and computing power to make crypto transactions, store data on the blockchain, and create smart contracts.
Before you start conceptualizing your own SaaS idea, we recommend researching the market of existing solutions. We analyzed existing startups and venture fund news to get you the list of the most profitable SaaS ideas on the market — take a look at their positioning and execution.
A collaboration and task management platform that helps marketing and blogging specialists to plan their content, maintain editorial calendars, keep in touch with contributors, and perform email outreach.
The startup is mainly used by marketing teams and individual specialists who either manage small teams or are self-employed. It’s also used by business owners who don’t have marketing experience — the tool works through best practices and provides insights.
A feedback management tool for small and medium businesses that allows collecting, managing, and storing customer feedback. The tool is connected to the content on the website — as soon as you get a comment or a request via a contact form, it’s automatically sent to your business Slack chat, email address, or Skype.
The tool allows directly contacting the customers who left feedback, receive updates on requested improvements, and send follow-ups. It’s integrated with Zapier — a popular platform for work automation.
A product management tool for software developers and testers where they can store the feedback, request feature improvements, monitor the task progress and control current goals.
The product is integrated with customer support software — developers can track feature requests that are coming directly from users — and collaboration platforms, such as Slack or Skype.
It’s an analytics solution where users can collect data from multiple analytics platforms and communication channels (Google Analytics, email, messengers) and send them to specialized tools. It’s that interconnectivity trend that we previously discussed — the SaaS tools won’t be cut-off from the overall software ecosystem, but facilitate inter-platform navigation.
The service supports popular analytics, automation, marketing, and e-commerce platforms — HubSpot, SalesForce, Google Analytics, etc.
It’s a cooperative environment that unites all task lists, to-dos, and notes into a single storage. It’s comfortable for collaborators who work with multiple teams simultaneously and use different tools in the process. This solution collects all the information, making planning easier for small teams and self-employed individuals.
The tool works as a web application or an iOS mobile client — the data is stored in the cloud. The tool is integrated with popular tools — Trello, Slack, Basecamp, WordPress, Google Drive, etc. The target audience of the company are businesses and individuals that work in highly technological fields, like software development or digital marketing, and use multiple tools every day.
It’s a fintech application that connects users to their bank accounts, allowing seamless management of financial data, transactions, and export of payment details. The solution targets businesses that perform multiple billing transfers daily with different banks, including global transactions.
The main features are ownership verification, fraud detection, billing automation, and financial data management. All data can be easily exported or transferred to connected solutions.
A blockchain solution that allows businesses to integrate their solutions to existing blockchain networks. As a result, online businesses can accept transactions in cryptocurrencies and rely on decentralized data storage offered by crypto networks.
The main software features are accessible immutable ledger, available permissionless network, and secure crypto transactions.
Prismic is a content management system that allows building simple product pages and blogs. The platform is focused specifically on the content-heavy website, offering readable templates to bloggers and business owners.
Similarly to Wix, Prismic has a custom site builder and pre-made templates for websites. Additionally, it has a rich content-management admin panel with management, scheduling features, page layout editor, and full analytics.
This application allows business owners to create dynamic tutorials on their websites and online applications. A user has to register an account, pick a guide template, add custom content, and change the design, if necessary.
All this functionality is delivered via a simple drag-and-click editor, with Canva-like functionality and look.
An online testing application that connects business owners to remote testers all over the world. It’s not just a testing environment, enabled via personalized software — but a marketplace, where testers offer their outsourcing services to business owners.
UserTesting allows text and voice communication with testers, as well as live audio and video streams. Business owners can control the testing progress in real-time and receive detailed reports on their QA activities.
It’s a Slack bot that manages the schedule of group members, which are located in different time zones. The application automates the organization of standup meetings — it automatically synchronizes each members’ schedule and creates a single event that’s comfortable for every member to attend.
Additionally, the tool can be integrated with Google Analytics, Slack, and website’s databases. Standuply has templates for schedules and feedback forms — users can use the tool immediately after the sign-up.
A media monitoring platform where brands and individuals can track their mentions on social media, or in the press, and get prompt user feedback. Similarly, businesses can monitor the mentions of their competitors and get informed public relations insights.
Additionally, Mention provides business owners with the list of local influencers and people who are experts in the brand’s niche. This mini-tool is similar to Google Alerts, but its functionality is expended to fit PR needs.
Typeform is a custom form-creating solution that can be integrated into the website. Business owners can make fun forms that are intuitive and easy to fill in. The solution targets e-commerce brands, B2C companies, and any businesses that have to deal with regular customer feedback.
An interactive tool that allows organizing data from text documents, spreadsheets, and online databases into intuitive visuals. The information can be exported from CVS, XLS, DOC, and other formats, and integrated with WordPress, Amazon Redshift, AWS, and other tools.
A Facebook marketing tool that allows defining a precise target audience for Facebook promotions. The tool tracks users’ behavior with the ads and segments them in groups based on the interactions with the ad. The app also assists in retargeting, creating custom audiences from Facebook profiles, and email addresses of the interested audience.
It’s a media-sharing software that allows recording images and videos and sharing them with colleagues. The tool supports GIFs creation, guides users each step fo the process, and features a rich template library.
A B2B video-conferencing tool for business collaboration, meetings, webinars, conferences, and standups. The platform supports video recording, universal messenger, file transfer, and real-time chat.
Zoom has a web version, along with desktop and mobile applications. All the personal data is stored on the Cloud — just by logging into an account, visitors access all chats, contacts, and recorded videos. Also, all sent data is easily backed up online.
A schedule management tool for organizing calls, meetings, and conferences with collaborators, clients, sales prospects, or potential hires. The tool is connected to Google Planner and Outlook, and it also supports custom planners on mobile devices. The application will automatically connect data from these calendars to the tools and prepare a personalized schedule.
Micro SaaS is a software-as-a-service company that is created and managed by a small team of 1–3 people. The product is developed for a small budget and is characterized by its narrow focus, dedicated users, and no additional funding. These businesses solve a particular B2B problem, and the products are often integrated into other, bigger tools.
It’s subscription-based software, oriented towards business owners, usually of small and medium companies. B2B SaaS products allow business owners to solve a particular business problem, provide infrastructure for performing technical tasks, lay the foundation for automation, and facilitate implement innovations to businesses.
The first step to executing startup ideas in 2021 is to test the concept of the product and business model by building an MVP. MVP stands for Minimal Viable Product — the minimalistic version of the services that showcase its essential design and functionality. Teams need to start with prototypes before building the full version of the service — this cut-down version can be tested on actual users and presented to stakeholders.
The process starts with making a low-fidelity prototype — a rough sketch and description of the service functionality, that is later used to build a high-fidelity prototype — a limited version of the actual product, that can be “experienced’ by actual users.
SaaS stands for Software-as-a-Service — it’s a software business model in which the service provider tech services on a subscription basis. SaaS services usually provide the infrastructure for tech-related projects, assist with automation, security, and data storage, using Cloud storage for remote data access.
SaaS offers multiple advantages both to service providers and end-users — let’s examine them briefly. Service providers can make a small tool for a low budget, and market it to narrow target audiences — there is no need for big budgets and global investments. Even 50 dedicated users can already drive enough profit. Such software is scalable because founders can constantly attract new users without losing the old ones.
Business owners who use the SaaS, benefit from its simplicity and accessibility. All technical difficulties are controlled by the third-party, so they can focus on important tasks. The application doesn’t have to be installed or updated — all patches are delivered automatically. The solution can be accessed from any device and anywhere — the data is stored on accessible cloud servers.
SaaS companies are fast-growing even with minimal investments: according to statistics from Insight Squared , an average prominent SaaS with success startup ideas has a growth ratio of 3.9 to 1 — for one invested dollar, business owners get about four dollars of return.
According to BetterCloud research, 86% of end-users of SaaS applications found them to be more helpful than desktop apps. Perhaps, that’s the reason why it’s likely that nearly all apps will become SaaS in the future — hence, business owners should get on board introducing SaaS to their niche before competitors.

Network effects have driven the first wave of successful internet companies. Whether it’s Facebook, LinkedIn or SnapChat, the more friends who use the product, the better the product experience becomes for you. You’re selfishly incentivized to convince your friends to use it. We haven’t seen this happen much in consumer hardware, especially hardware subscription companies, though. Can hardware be social? Is it possible?
Lets walk through an imaginary home security camera company. Its a interior/exterior camera which does object/face detection to provide end users with a superior product experience of what’s actually happening in their lives.
The more people who buy their camera, the more data they get, the better their computer vision algorithms become at detecting people and activity. As tech people, we understand how more data improves algorithms… but most customers don’t. It does become a better product experience over time, but it doesn’t directly sell more cameras because customers can only tell their friends that their new camera is great. It doesn’t give them a narrative to truly convince their friends to buy the product because their own experience gets better.
How do we build network effects directly into a hardware company’s product experience?
What if when I buy a camera, I login via Facebook, which allows the product to automatically tag people it sees with real names. When my neighbor is at my front door, or as my child arrives home from school, it recognizes their face and lets me know. Our elementary school is a few blocks away, and our son is almost old enough to walk home by himself, but we worry what might happen along the way. If my camera can recognize my son, and my neighbor buys the same device, why can’t his camera recognize my son as he walks past his home as well?
So if I convince my neighbor to buy the same camera, I’ll also try to convince everyone in the neighborhood, so I can see my kid walking all the way home from school, or when he happens to stop by a friend’s house to play in their backyard without telling us. That never happens, right?
With a product like this, I’m directly incentivized to tell dozens of people I know to buy a hardware product that gets better when more people I know use it. As product builders, we need to help our users share a narrative with their friends. In this case, this product experience tells a simple emotional story that we all understand. It then creates a network effect that directly drive sales.
Also, I’m paying a monthly fee for the camera product, so we can start to talk about SaaS viral coefficients. The viral cycle time will be slower with hardware than pure software, Amazon Prime same day delivery helps here. Fundamentally the thesis is that it’ll help the product reach massive scale at cheaper than usual customer acquisition costs. More on this topic in future posts.
That said, what businesses today look like this? Can it be applied to your idea? If so, let’s chat.
Note. I realize all the Big Brother concerns around this camera idea. You don’t have to remind me. That said, this is a good example of consumers willing to give up some privacy for features. When it comes to my child’s safety, I’m happy to give up some. The phone in your pocket is also tracking your every move around town. Most of you don’t turn it off, because you like using Google Maps. Let’s assume we figure out a permissions system that every user understands. Face tagging accuracy has also improved dramatically in the past few years.

Ask anyone working on a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product what’s most important, and you’ll hear many variations of the same thing: customer interviews, customer development, getting out of the building, surveying, etc.
Customer development is the worst thing you can do for your early-stage SaaS product.
It’s gone too far. For anyone getting into the business, they couldn’t help but assume that customers/beta users should be driving the direction of their product. And that couldn’t be further from the truth.
In building HookFeed and Minimalytics, we’ve developed our own little process for reducing risk and it goes like this:
Repeat steps 6 and 7 until you have a solid V1 of your product — something *most* people will happily pay for which you don’t have to preface with, “features x, y, and z are coming soon — I promise!”
At some point prior to V1, you’ll want to release a beta and onboard users one-by-one. The product should be valuable to a small set of people at this point, but not everyone.
The day we launched Minimalytics, we broke-even on our (not-cheap) hosting costs, even though the product was far from complete.
This marked the first time we considered doing customer interviews, inspired by Michael Sacca/Tiny Factory’s hustle getting Brandisty off the ground.
We learned an incredible amount from these interviews and it’s definitely driving V2 of the product.
But before you have your beta ready, you need other experienced SaaS folks to collaborate with. You can’t be on an island.
Having the customer’s voice be the only one in your ear can be damaging to your product.
FreshBooks, Campaign Monitor, Intercom, Basecamp — they all changed the way industries work. They simplified workflows and delivered products which their customers would never have described as solutions prior to experiencing them themselves.
Customer’s idea of improving a spoon — a spork.
This isn’t to say that customers are wrong, or that their opinions aren’t valuable. I’m simply saying that they are often viewing a problem through their own lens, rather than the lens of your entire market.
Product person’s idea of improving a spoon — a fork.
Product people understand the difference there — and will give you better advice based on their experience (which likely includes many failures they can warn you of).
Start by talking to your heroes. It’s easier than you think, and the connections will continue to help you the closer you get to launch.
Then, you should organize or join a small chat community where you can hang out online with similar folks. We hang out in a small chat full of self-funders and it has brought us closer to folks like James Deer, Brennan Dunn, Andrew Culver, Josh Pigford, and many more who never hesitate to share awesome, critical feedback on every move we make.
Every part of our products from pricing to marketing to code has been influenced on a significant level by the folks we’ve met online.
And in exchange, we do our best to give back that value to anyone we can help with straight-up advice. It’s really an amazing industry we’re living in, and if you’re not taking advantage of it…you should start today.
Seriously, post something like this on Twitter right now:
Anyone know of a hangout/chat online full of smart SaaS folk? I’d love to get to know more people building awesome stuff.
Or you could go checkout one of the following:

Q1 earnings season for Cloud businesses is now behind us. The 54 companies that I’ll discuss here (which is not an exhaustive list, but is still fairly comprehensive) all reported quarterly earnings sometime between April 29th — June 9th. In this post I’ll take a data-driven approach to evaluate the overall group’s performance, and highlight individual standouts along the way. As a venture capitalist at Redpoint Ventures, I’ll try to cater my analysis through the lens of a private investor. Over my time at Redpoint, I’ve had the opportunity to meet with hundreds of entrepreneurs who are all building special companies. Through these interactions, I’ve built up mental benchmarks for metrics on which I place extra emphasis. My hope is that this analysis can provide startup entrepreneurs with a framework for how to manage their business around SaaS metrics (e.g., net retention and CAC payback).
Public SaaS Valuations
The last couple months have been extremely volatile for technology (particularly SaaS) stocks. We saw the Vix (an index that measures volatility) hit an all-time high of 82, surpassing its previous max of 80 during the financial crisis of 2008. We saw the Nasdaq quickly drop ~30%, only to fully recover and hit all-time highs last week in a dramatic V-shaped recovery. We saw businesses like Zoom trade at >60x NTM revenue, exceed quarterly expectations by >60%, and nearly double year-end revenue guidance. And finally, the tech IPO markets showed their strength when ZoomInfo successfully priced its IPO to raise ~$1Bn. This represented the largest software IPO in the last decade, and one of the highest revenue multiples for a tech IPO over the same time period. Overall, the basket of 54 SaaS stocks analyzed in this post have created roughly $300Bn in market cap this year alone. As a retail investor, investing equally across this basket of companies at the beginning of the year would have yielded a 37% return year-to-date (while the S&P is down 1% and the Nasdaq is only up 9%). To many, this might seem surprising given the current state of the country, given the struggle for racial justice, the tragedy of Covid-19, and our current high unemployment rates.
So what’s driving the massive tide lifting SaaS stocks? There isn’t one obvious answer, but rather a confluence of factors. First, there are a number of industries that are significantly affected by Covid-19 — travel, hospitality, casinos & gaming, retail, restaurants, etc. Large hedge funds and institutional investors have rotated out of positions in these industries and need somewhere to park this money. What better place than in business with highly predictable SaaS revenue streams, many of whom are seeing Covid tailwinds as digital transformations are pulled forward. Companies like Zoom, Datadog, and Fastly have all seen demand for their products spike. Furthermore, the unit economics of these SaaS businesses are incredibly attractive. Companies like Twilio, with high net retention of 143% (a metric I’ll get into more later), can afford to add 0 new customers over the next year and still grow 43% annually. This is astounding, and something no other industry can claim. The lifetime value of each customer (the value of all future cash flows from that customer) is often multiples greater than the cost to acquire them. The combo of predictable revenue streams, high (and in some cases accelerating) revenue growth, and attractive unit economics have made SaaS an incredibly attractive market throughout these turbulent times. The interesting nuance, of course, is that not all cloud businesses have benefited equally. In our current environment, the high-growth category leaders have seen disproportionate gains compared to their lower growth, “value stock” counterparts. Zoom, Crowdstrike, Bill.com, Twilio, Coupa, Fastly, Zscaler and others have all blown past pre-Covid levels to hit all-time highs in the last couple weeks. But Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit, New Relic and other value stocks have either struggled to nudge past pre-Covid highs or haven’t completely rebounded yet. Overall, this flight to quality has lifted cloud businesses, and compounded to lift the top cloud businesses even more. The bigger question remains what will happen when the economy stabilizes and large institutional investors rotate back into the abandoned industries like travel and hospitality. Only time will tell if the “Covid-bump” for cloud businesses will last!
Q1 Big Winners
Coming out of Q1 there were a few businesses that in my mind stood out as “Big Winners.” These companies showed a combination of incredibly strong results, robust outlooks, and attractive unit economics. The public markets rewarded all of them handsomely. I’ll take a closer look at each of these businesses in the sections below.
Valuation Metrics
Before getting into the Q1 data, it’s important to frame the conversation around valuations. Just about all cloud companies are valued off of a multiple of their revenue. That is, their Enterprise Value / NTM (Next Twelve Months) Revenue. We use forward revenue estimates as a company’s future outlook determines its worth. As you can see from the chart below, we’re currently at all-time-high revenue multiples and valuations, albeit in the middle of a global pandemic. Median forward revenue multiples for all cloud businesses currently sits right around 12x, and the median of the top 5 multiples has expanded the most.
Doubling clicking one layer further, we see high-growth businesses have seen the greatest multiple expansion since Covid. In the below chart I define High Growth as >30% projected NTM growth, Mid Growth as 15%-30% and Low Growth as anything <15%.
Q1 Results Relative To Consensus Estimates
Beating consensus revenue estimates are the first aspect of a successful quarter. So what are these consensus estimates and who creates them? Every public company has a number of equity research analysts covering them who build their own forecasted models, which combine guidance from the company and their own research / sentiment analysis. The consensus estimates are the average of all the individual analysts’ projections. Generally when you hear “consensus estimates” it refers to revenue and earnings (EPS), but for the purpose of this analysis we’ll just be looking at revenue consensus estimates (as this is the metric these companies are valued off). For every public company the expectation is that they’ll beat consensus estimates, because companies often guide research analysts to the lower end of their internal projections. They do this to set themselves up to consistently beat estimates, demonstrating momentum. Cisco, for example, famously beat earnings expectations for 43 straight quarters in the 1990s.
It’s also important to note that when a company is providing guidance for the “next quarter,” they are (in some cases) already halfway through that quarter due to the timing of earnings calls. By then, they generally have a good sense for how the quarter is going and can guide ever so slightly under their internal projections. As the data shows below, the median “beat” of quarterly consensus estimates was ~4% in Q1.
As you can see from the data below the vast majority of cloud businesses beat the consensus estimates for Q1.
As you can see from the data above, 94% of businesses beat their Q1 revenue consensus estimates. The median beat was 3.9%, a top quartile beat was anything >6.3%, and a top decile beat was anything >9.6%. And as you can see from the data, the results are nearly identical from companies with March and April quarter ends.
So how did our “Big Winners” perform in Q1 relative to consensus estimates? Bill.com, Datadog, Twilio and Zoom were all top decile performers. Crowdstrike, Fastly and Shopify were top quartile. Zscaler was above median.
Next Quarter’s Guidance Relative to Consensus Estimates
Guiding above next quarter’s consensus revenue estimates is the second factor of a successful quarter. Generally, companies will give a guidance range (e.g., $95M — $100M), and the numbers I’m showing are the midpoint. Providing guidance that is greater than consensus estimates is a sign of improving business momentum, or confidence that the business will perform better than previously expected. The concept of guiding higher than expectations is considered a “raise.” When you hear the term “beat and raise” the beat refers to beating current quarters expectations (what we discussed in the previous section), and the raise is raising guidance for future quarters (generally its annual guidance, but for this analysis we’re just looking at the next quarters guidance).
As you can see from the data below, there was a difference in the percentage of raises from March to April. My guess here is that there was even more uncertainty around the pandemic’s effects in March, and because of this companies were more conservative in their guidance. They were preparing for the worst. A month later two things happened. Future estimates had more time to be revised down, and companies had a much better sense for the pandemic’s impact on their business. Therefore they didn’t feel the need to guide so conservatively (with a bigger cushion). Here’s the data:
As you can see from the data above, 40% of businesses guided above their Q2 revenue consensus estimates. The overall guidance outlook median came in 1% under consensus estimates. A top quartile guidance raise was anything >1.9%, and a top decile guidance raise was anything >7.4%. Of the companies that provided a guidance raise, the median raise was 3.6%.
So how did our “Big Winners” perform in Q1 relative to consensus estimates? Crowdstrike, Datadog, Fastly, Twilio and Zoom were all top decile performers. Bill.com was barely outside the top decile and Zscaler was above the median.
Growth
Demonstrating high growth is the third aspect of a successful quarter. This metric is more self-explanatory so I won’t go into detail. The growth shown below is a year-over-year growth for reported quarters. The formula to calculate this is: (Q1 ’20 revenue) / (Q1 ’19 revenue) -1.
As you can see from the data above the median growth rate was 31%, a top quartile growth rate was anything >42%, and a top decile growth rate was anything >53%.
So how did our “Big Winners” perform in Q1? Bill.com, Crowdstrike, Datadog, Twilio and Zoom were all top decile performers. Shopify was in the top quartile, and Fastly and Zscaler were above the median.
Net Revenue Retention
High net revenue retention is the fourth aspect of a successful quarter, and one of my favorite metrics to evaluate in private SaaS companies. It is calculated by taking the annual recurring revenue of a cohort of customers from 1 year ago, and comparing it to the current annual recurring revenue of that same set of customers (even if you experienced churn and that group of customers now only has 9, or anything <10). In simpler terms — if you had 10 customers 1 year ago that were paying you $1M in aggregate annual recurring revenue, and today they are paying you $1.1M, your net revenue retention would be 110%. The reason I love this metric is because it really demonstrates how much customers love your product. A high net revenue retention implies that your customers are expanding the usage of your product (adding more seats / users / volume — upsells) or buying other products that you offer (cross-sells), at a higher rate than they are reducing spend (churn). Here’s why this metric is so significant: It shows how fast you can grow your business annually without adding any new customers. As a public company with significant scale, it’s hard to grow quickly if you have to rely solely on new customers for that growth. At $200M+ ARR, the amount of new-logo ARR you need to add to grow 30%+ is significant. On the other hand, if your net revenue retention is 120%, you only need to grow new logo revenue 10% to be a “high growth” business.
I’ve looked at thousands of private companies, and over time have come up with benchmarks for best-in-class, good, and subpar net revenue retention. Not surprisingly, these benchmarks match up relatively well with the numbers public companies reported. I generally classify anything >130% as best in class, 115% — 130% as good, and anything less than 115% as subpar. For businesses selling predominantly to SMB customers, these benchmarks are all slightly lower given the higher-churn nature of SMBs. I consider >120% best in class for companies selling to SMBs (like Bill.com). Here’s the data from Q1 earnings:
As you can see from the data above, the median net revenue retention rate was 117%, a top quartile net revenue retention rate was anything >122%, and a top decile net revenue retention rate was anything >130%. The one point to note: not all companies report this number. It’s fair to assume that the majority of companies who don’t report this metric probably fall into the subpar category. Because of this, the median, top quartile, and top decile numbers mentioned above probably are better than reality.
So how did our “Big Winners” perform in Q1? Datadog, Fastly, Twilio, Zoom and Bill.com were all top decile. I’m including Bill.com here because 120% net retention selling to SMBs is phenomenal. Crowdstrike was in the top quartile, and Zscaler was above the median.
Sales Efficiency: Gross Margin Adjusted CAC Payback
Demonstrating the ability to efficiently acquire customers is the fifth aspect of a successful quarter. The metric used to measure this is my second-favorite SaaS metric (behind net revenue retention) — Gross Margin Adjusted CAC Payback. It’s a mouthful, but this metric is so important because it demonstrates how sustainable a company’s growth is. In theory, any growth rate is possible with an unlimited budget to hire AEs. However, if these AEs aren’t hitting quota and the OTE (base + commission) you’re paying them doesn’t justify the revenue they bring in, your business will burn through money. This is unsustainable. Because of the recurring nature of SaaS revenue, you can afford to have paybacks longer than 1 year. In fact, this is quite normal.
All that said, Gross Margin Adjusted CAC Payback is relatively simple to calculate. You divide the previous quarter’s S&M expense (fully burdened CAC) by the net new ARR added in the current quarter (new logo ARR + Expansion — Churn — Contraction) multiplied by the gross margin. You then multiply this by 12 to get the number of months it takes to pay back CAC.
(Previous Q S&M) / (Net New ARR x Gross Margin) x 12
A simpler way to calculate net new ARR is by taking the current quarter’s ARR and subtracting the ending ARR from one quarter prior. Similar to net revenue retention, I’ve built up benchmarks to evaluate private companies’ performance. I generally classify any payback <12 months as best in class, 12–24 months as good, and anything >24 months as subpar. The public company data for payback doesn’t match up as nicely with my benchmarks for net revenue retention. The primary reason for this is that public companies can afford to have longer paybacks. At $200M+ ARR, businesses have built up a substantial base of recurring revenue streams that have already paid back their initial CAC. Their ongoing revenue can “fund” new logo acquisition and allow the business to operate profitably at paybacks much larger than what private companies (with smaller ARR bases) can afford.
Most public companies don’t disclose ARR (and when they do, it’s often not the same definition of ARR as we use for private companies). Because of this we have to use an implied ARR metric. To calculate implied ARR I take the subscription revenue in a quarter and multiply it by 4. So for public companies the formula to calculate gross margin adjusted payback is:
[(Previous Q S&M) / ((Current Q Subscription Rev x 4) — (Previous Q Subscription Rev x 4)) x Gross Margin] x 12
Here’s the payback data from Q1. Not every company reports subscription revenue, so they’ve been left out of the analysis.
As you can see from the data above, the median gross margin adjusted payback was 29 months, a top quartile gross margin adjusted payback was anything <20 months, and a top decile gross margin adjusted payback was anything <13 months.
So how did our “Big Winners” perform in Q1 relative to consensus estimates? Crowdstrike, Datadog and Zoom were all top decile performers. Bill.com and Twilio were top quartile. Fastly and Zscaler were above median.
Change in Share Price
At the end of the day what investors care about is what happened to the stock after earnings were reported. The stock reaction alone doesn’t represent the strength of a company’s quarter, so the below data has to be viewed in tandem with everything discussed above. Oftentimes the buy-side expects a company to perform well (or poorly), and the company’s stock going into earnings already has these expectations baked in. In these situations the stock’s earnings reaction could be flat. However, it’s still a fun data point to track.
What I’ve shown below is the market-adjusted stock price reaction. This means I’ve removed any impact of broader market shifts to isolate the company’s earnings impact on the stock. As an example, a day after SurveyMonkey reported earnings their stock was up 9%. However the market (using the Nasdaq as a proxy) was up 2% that same day. This implies that even without earnings SurveyMonkey would likely have been up 2%. To calculate the specific impact of earnings on the stock we need to strip out the broader markets movement. To do this we subtract the market’s movement from the stocks movement: (% Change in Stock) — (% Change in Nasdaq)
Wrapping Up
This quarter has been a wild ride for SaaS businesses. As a group they’ve performed quite well during these volatile times in the broader market, and in that sense the future looks bright.
Here’s a summary of the key stats for each category we talked about, and how the “Big Winners” performed. Excluding the share price reaction, Datadog and Zoom are the only two companies to perform at Top Decile levels across every metric and are my Elite Performers of Q1! Hopefully this provides a blueprint for every entrepreneur out there reading this post.
The Data
The data for this post was sourced from public company filings, Wall Street Research and Pitchbook. If you’d like to explore the raw data I’ve included it below. Looking forward to providing more earnings summaries for future quarters!

Be the first to respond.
The folder on my Macbook Pro called “VC Pitch Deck 2014” has 155 documents.
37 of them are Powerpoint presentations.
We started with 15 slides.
And ended up with 74 slides.
This is the story of how we created the pitch deck that helped Canvas raise a $9 million funding round.
To be clear, a pitch deck is a small part of the overall funding process. I can’t stress this point enough. If we didn’t have fantastic growth, passionate employees, a disruptive platform and a CEO who is a great leader and presenter, then none of this story would matter.
But the pitch deck is what ties it all together. And we wanted to get it right.
It all started about 8 months ago on April 11.
We met in a small conference room here in Refraction, the coworking space that serves as our office, located just outside of Washington, D.C.
Our merry band of fundraisers in this meeting included myself, the director of marketing; Brent, our head of UX/UI; Lynn, our killer graphic designer; and of course our fearless leader, James Quigley, the CEO of Canvas.
James explained that we needed a few documents to kick off our funding efforts and road show. These included a one-page company overview, a three-page overview and a pitch deck. Sounds easy enough, right? Little did I know this was the start of a multi-month journey to make the perfect pitch deck.
I’m generally decent at pitching ideas but actual presentation design? This was going to be a whole new ball game.
AHHHH!
For the first few weeks, I went through the previous Canvas pitch deck and dove into as much information online as I could find. I was not above googling “how to create a pitch deck” and actually found some pretty interesting resources.
The first thing we did was to put together a framework using only bullets and text. We felt like it made the most sense to agree on the content and structure before getting our designer involved and taking up her time.
The basic framework we put together initially looked something like this:
With the basics in place, it was time for design.
From the beginning, we wanted to make it clear that our product is disruptive and a natural fit with the overall analog to digital transformation that every industry is experiencing. Software is eating the world. We wanted to show how exactly we fit into that.
We also wanted to emphasize that the problem (paperwork and all the inefficiencies that come with it) is a huge, global issue and therefore giant opportunity. And that it’s not just about replacing paperwork, but doing even more than you ever could before with your business information.
As we focused on design, we wanted to do a couple of other things, including:
By the end of May, we had a solid, working pitch deck that was 19 slides + an appendix with another 19 slides. By this point, we had expanded the initial framework to include more about Canvas. We wanted to highlight our competitive differentiations, like our App Builder and Application Store. WIth that done, we were ready to go and we started sending it out and using it in presentations.
I was feeling pretty good. Pitch deck perfection, right?
Nope.
Between the end of May and the most current version of our pitch deck in early October, we tweaked the presentation more times than I can count. We ended up with over 20 versions of our pitch deck. The most recent version of the deck has 74 slides. Our appendix grew from 19 slides to 47 slides.
How does this happen?
Data changes as time goes by and there are always more questions.
Not surprisingly, VCs ask a lot of questions during pitches. Our approach was to write down these questions and include the answers in the appendix. So if the question came up again, we could be prepared to answer it, with stats and charts to back us up in the pitch deck.
Here are a few examples of the questions that we addressed:
On that last note, we decided to model our metrics against some SaaS industry data in a study released by a well-known VC group. This is something that I’d recommend every SaaS company do and include in your pitch, especially if the comparison works out in your favor.
Each time a question came up that was important enough to include in the pitch deck, we’d revise the deck. You think it’s perfect and then you need to get a new month of data in or add a new chart and you revise it some more.
Special thanks to Lynn, our graphic designer for putting up with all of our revision requests and for making this look great (and for not throwing things at me when I came back with a request to revise a slide for the ninth time).
As far as the presentations go, I wasn’t in on all of them, but I was there for a lot of them. Our CEO, James Quigley, would make the presentation and lead the discussion, and I was there for backup. It was a great experience.
We got into a nice routine. Arrive 10–15 minutes early and get set up in the meeting room with a laptop hooked up to a projector. It’s interesting how many VCs have their own branded drink coasters in these rooms.
In some cases, we met with one or two partners. In other cases, there would be over 10 people in the room. Sometimes there would be lunch, sometimes not.
In some meetings, people were interested in going through every single one of the slides in order. Other times they wanted to go straight into questions and we’d jump around a lot. In some cases, folks had printed out our entire pitch deck and were flipping through it, heads down, as James talked. In other cases, they could care less about the slides and just wanted to have a conversation. I think it depended on how much someone knew about us before the meeting. It was different every time. And that’s fine. A pitch deck isn’t meant to be the star of the show.
Some VCs understood our value and mission and some didn’t. Sometimes one little thing might not make it the right fit. It’s a lot easier for VCs to say no than yes — so don’t be surprised or discouraged if you get a lot of no’s. But it only takes one yes. We’re all happy where we ended up with River Cities leading our round.
After months of (metaphorical) blood, sweat and tears, it’s hard for me to believe that it’s all over now. If I knew how many revisions and redos our pitch deck would need when I first started, I might have just run out of the meeting screaming.
But in the end, I’m glad it happened this way. I learned how important every little detail can be, how it’s not just what you say, but how you say it, and how timing can be everything. If someone likes you but has another deal in motion at the time, it’s going to be tough.
I uploaded 10 slides from our pitch deck that seemed to resonate most with the VCs we met with (minus the ones with sensitive data). These aren’t meant to be the first or only slides you should have in your pitch, but I hope this is valuable for anyone that might be interested in seeing how things turned out.
There’s really no such thing as a perfect pitch deck. But you should still try.

Top highlight
TL;DR: This tutorial is about building a small, profitable SaaS webservice, Menumake, from scratch and making it earning $1000 per month. This has nothing to do with multibillion unicorn startups, I’m just describing my experience. It’s about a useful, robust, and profitable tool that anyone can make. And the last point, this webservice has been made for the Russian domestic market, so I’ve translated everything into English and USD for convenience. Otherwise, this experience is pretty general and could be adopted anywhere.
It all started with my other SaaS webservice called Postio, which I built to make it easier for people to find and publish content to their social accounts and groups. As a part of its marketing strategy, I had bought and published a dozen articles on various subjects targeted at the webservice’s audience on its blog to get some extra traffic from search engines.
Then, all of a sudden, Postio started to get a relatively large amount of traffic from Google and Yandex (a Russian search engine) with keywords that have nothing to do with Postio itself.
This is where the actual story begins.
Clearly people were having real issues with this menu thing. A short research showed that a lot of group owners on Vk.com (the Russian Facebook) use a graphical menu fixed at the top of a group to redirect their audience to the most important parts of the group, such as testimonials, pricing, and an order form.
You see, groups in this social network eventually become some sort of shop that many people use to start a business, without having the hassle of setting up a standalone website. So it wasn’t just a bunch of some random groups about kittens (although there definitely was a lot of this type), but small businesses with some pain point that could be solved, more or less, automatically. Obviously they needed a solution so badly that they Googled it quite often.
But here’s the best part. In order to make this menu, they had to create it in an image editor, cut it, and then build the menu with a sort of wiki-style mark up. This was definitely too much for them, and outsourcing this job at a price of about $20 a piece was quite common.
The usual process of creating a menu was something like this:
Not bad, eh?
Now, let’s find out what we can do to alleviate the problem.
First, I had to explore the possibilities of the API of the social network to determine what actions could be automated, and to what degree.
It turned out that the API could do anything I needed, with the exception of pinning a post. But it’s too much for an MVP, so I decided to cut down these features:
So basically, what I had to make was an image generator and an uploader. So here is what it looked like after two to three days of development.
Ugly, I know. But it was enough to test whether users would be willing to pay for this automated solution.
The menu creation dialogue was also um… pretty imperfect.
Yeah, I too used to be a perfectionist. Now I ship.
This was relatively easy in my case because the existing traffic was what I started with. So all I had to do was just put a couple of buttons here and there in the article and wait for visitors to come.
This is what it looked like:
Without even looking at the sales stat we can see that users were pretty much interested in the service. Mind you, this was just the hey-you-have-a-problem-we-have-a-solution type of traffic, with a really lousy landing page based on a free template.
Now, here are some raw stats served fresh (okay, not so fresh) from the DB:
Not a massive success, huh? But it worked, and users were willing to pay for it. There were a lot of abandoned, unpaid menus though (menus_created vs menus_paid). But anyway, it’s just a (very crude) MVP.
As you can tell by the stats, I tinkered a bit with the price, changing it from $6 to $4 per menu, trying to get some insights on pricing.
Now that we know our MVP is viable, it’s time to figure out what price users are willing to pay for our service. And it should be data-driven, no more guesstimating.
Let me digress a little and explain why I chose to charge on a per-menu basis instead of a standard monthly approach. The API of the uplink social network is pretty much unstable, so the subscription model would be a disaster because I had to constantly refund the users who had been affected by bugs in the API.
So, back to the price. Split testing is the easiest way to identify the most profitable price that users are comfortable with. Basically, I set a random price for each user upon signing up, and I then tracked every action associated with the price. The price grid looked like this (yes, I also added a price for updating a menu and a lot of different features, like fine tuning the design of menu items):
I also removed email from signing up and made it one-click to get more sign ups (and stats) from users. After a month or so I got this:
What do these stats tell us? Pretty interesting stuff:
Even though the $2 price appeared to be much less hassle for the same revenue, I decided to stick with $1 because I wanted users to create as many menus as they wanted, as every menu had a little viral mechanism. I’ll explain this in a future article.
After I made up my mind on the price, I then had to add more features that users needed. Let me show what the menu creation page eventually looked like:
Still messy and crude but it did its job well. And it really had nothing fancy under the kimono, just some PHP and Imagemagick. It took me two nights to build and the process was a lot of fun, as ever since I was a teenager I’ve always enjoyed working with image generation. I still remember those sleepless nights spent learning ray tracing and 3D programming with Delphi. Ah, the good old days.
First I wanted to leverage what this webservice had started with — the existing SEO traffic from the article. Actually, this had been done already, so all I had to do was to enlarge the CTA button a little and make it more noticeable. This simple action got me about 150 visits per day.
But when I did this, I noticed that the webservice itself started to get attention from search engines, so the total traffic was around 200 visitors per day. That yielded an average of 100 sign ups per day.
Okay, no more boring text, here are the final stats for November 2016:
Please note that Users simply reflects the number of users that signed up on the date, not the total number of users participating in activities in the webservice. The latter is much bigger due to recurring actions from earlier users.
Is this story a massive success? Hardly — but I hope it will be useful for someone who is still in doubt about making something small and profitable.
There are a lot of things here that haven’t received the attention they deserve.
What would you like me to elaborate on in future articles?

How do you work with customer loyalty? You earn trust by delivering quality service and providing customers with benefits they can’t get anywhere else. Instead of chasing new clients, you could put more effort into maintaining relationships with the old ones. Today, companies can build loyalty from their customers by understanding how to make their lives better and more convenient.
In a post-coronavirus world, it can take a long time to get back to normal operating conditions. Use this time to think about your current customer relationships and how to keep them “healthy.”
Customers are generally people of habit, and many of them are happy to receive additional value for being loyal to their favorite brand. Previously, loyalty programs were primarily used by airlines and chain stores, but the trend has shifted and brands in many industries now offer programs to reward customers for their loyalty.
Loyalty programs are often overlooked, but they can be a vital tool in building trust with customers if implemented wisely. Below are some statistics showing the importance of using loyalty programs.
From a business perspective, the importance of loyalty programs is pretty obvious! Consider the following statistics to better understand this:
Given this, it should come as no surprise that the loyalty management market is likely to grow at a phenomenal 23.3% per year, and its value is projected to reach $9.28 billion in 2024 against $2.617 billion in 2018. ²
Reward systems are one of the most flexible and efficient ways for a brand to interact with users. Incentives for activity, cashback for purchases, rewards for reviews, personal discounts, premium functionality, special offers and bonuses, reputation systems, and much more.
While studying the applications, I came across some popular SaaS solutions in loyalty management used by global brands. Here are my findings.

This article covers the key aspects of designing and implementing an effective customer acquisition strategy. It zeros in on a few important decisions when it comes to the customer acquisition process:
This article will not provide quick solutions or silver bullets. Furthermore, it does not advocate for one approach over another. However, the goal of this article is to guide industry leaders and practitioners through a detailed process of evaluating options when designing a customer acquisition strategy. Specifically, its aim is to help Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses determine whether a freemium or free trial model is right for their organizations.
While I and the co-founders of Aptrinsic were writing our book — Mastering Product Experience in SaaS: How To Deliver Personalized Product Experiences with Product-Led Go-to-Market Strategy — we spent countless hours researching customer acquisition strategies and pricing models. As part of that, we interviewed SaaS industry leaders. What we found is that just about every SaaS company goes through a heated debate about whether or not to offer a free trial or freemium. We even went through that at Aptrinsic, when getting ready to launch our Product Experience Platform.

Feel free to skip to the section of this article that interests you but before you do, let me tell you a real story. All of us can relate to this experience…
In November 2017, we, at Aptrinsic, hosted our first industry event: Mastering Product Adoption and Growth. It seemed to go well but we included a survey in our follow-up email to understand what could be improved in our next event. We needed to find an easy-to-use tool that would allow me to quickly create a simple survey.
SurveyMonkey was the first company to pop into my head. I visited their website and quickly created an account. A few minutes later, I was on my way to designing an eight-question survey. SurveyMonkey allows people to create simple surveys for free but you need to pay to use their more advanced functionality. It took me about 30 minutes to design a free survey and I decided to pay to unlock advanced features that would allow me to create a simplified survey with matrix/rating scale questions. Since we were planning to conduct a few events and major market research in the next year, we used a credit card to pay $408 for an annual subscription.
I had zero interaction with sales, customer support/success, or marketing. I had a need, and I tried and bought the product once I was confident that it could solve my need on a consistent basis. This is a great example of a simple, frictionless product-led customer acquisition strategy in action.
Of course, SurveyMonkey benefits from being the leader in its category. Their name is synonymous with online surveys (read How Industry Leaders Create Strong Brands). It takes years to become a category leader but when it happens, the brand realizes outsized rewards. I didn’t type “online surveys” into Google search. Even though I had never used SurveyMonkey, I instantly went directly to their website — that’s a brand recall in action. Aside from an incredibly strong brand, something else enables SurveyMonkey to score a customer with zero help from sales reps.
Customer expectations are rapidly changing. Consumer companies are often ahead of the curve when it comes to using new technologies to reimagine customer experiences. In our daily lives, we are exposed to numerous, stellar customer experiences that set the standard for us, even in our professional lives. In both the B2C and B2B worlds, companies are selling to individuals. You can call it Me2B, B2Me, or B2I (read the interview by Bill Price on Openview Labs). Whatever you call it, it has redefined how companies need to engage and sell.
Simply put, SaaS companies must transition and change their customer acquisition strategy to model those in the consumer industry. Business buyers no longer accept long, sales-heavy buying processes.
Just look at the most successful companies in the last generation of SaaS products: Slack, InVision, Asana, Dropbox, Zoom, to name a few. All of them follow a new customer acquisition strategy that puts prospects at the center. They optimize the buying process to fit buyers’ needs. Their customer acquisition strategy enables prospects to try their products before they buy.
The best companies in the new generation of SaaS are focusing on product growth strategies and tactics that bring product growth teams closer to the customer acquisition process. In other words, product leaders are increasingly more involved in the customer acquisition process (read Why Product Teams Must Join the Customer Acquisition Process).
Along those same lines, SurveyMonkey makes it easy for prospects to try and buy their product. Just think about the efficiency: I paid $408 for an annual subscription after just 30 minutes of using their product. Zero overhead was spent, and no salespeople were involved explaining how to use the product or trying to upsell me.
I wasn’t qualified by a Sales Development Representative and I didn’t submit a long lead form to “hear back” from their team. Of course, for the purpose of this discussion, I’m omitting the fact that SurveyMonkey spent many years establishing a leading brand in its category (so I can recall it right away). And make no mistake, my buying intent was high too: I had an urgent problem that I had to get off my shoulders. Still, I could have tried a competitive product and not had the same easy, satisfying experience.
Let’s take a deeper dive into why SaaS companies have to re-evaluate and design their customer acquisition strategies and how the pricing model fits into it.
In most cases, a customer acquisition strategy describes the media, channels, and tools to gain new customers. In the traditional sense, a customer acquisition strategy is a list of channels and techniques of where and how customers will be acquired.
This definition is incomplete. It’s generally a good idea to plan how you will get your message across what channels and by targeting what customers. However, SaaS companies have to also deliberately design an initial interaction between the prospect and their product.
A customer acquisition strategy is an essential part of your go-to-market (GTM) strategy (to read more on go-to-market strategy and go-to-market fit in the book — Survival to Thrival by Tae Hea Nahm and Bob Tinker). Before charting your customer acquisition plan, your team has to be clear on four essential elements of the GTM strategy. Just a reminder, a GTM strategy covers the following elements:
Questions:- Who is your ideal customer? - What pains do your customers experience?- Can you describe a day in the life of your target customer? - How does your product fit into the customer’s daily activities and workflow?
Outcomes:- Ideal customer profile (ICP)- Strategic messaging and positioning
Questions:- What markets do you want to pursue?- How big is your addressable market? Is it growing, stable, or declining?- Who are the biggest players in the market?
Outcomes:- Market segmentation and analysis- Competitive positioning
Questions:- What product are you selling? What is your product’s unique value proposition? - How do you describe your product’s value? - How are you different from your competitors? - What is your product pricing strategy (based on usage, features, capacity, seats, etc.)? - How do you know which features to build next?
Outcomes:- Product offering - Value proposition- Pricing strategy- Product vision/roadmap
Questions:- What are the most effective channels to reach your target customers?- What are the most popular publications that your target customers read?- What social media channels do your customers use the most?- What channels enable optimal customer acquisition cost (CAC)?- How do your marketing channels correlate with product signup rates and won deals?
Outcomes:- Demand generation strategy- Content and distribution strategy- Paid media strategy- Public Relations plan
We are not going to spend much time breaking down the GTM strategy. However, understanding who you are targeting, where, with what product and how will help you design an effective customer acquisition strategy. A customer acquisition strategy describes how all of these elements work together. It also describes what the first interaction between the prospect and product should look like.
Another important aspect of designing a customer acquisition strategy is focusing on how prospects buy as opposed to how your company sells its product. That means you need to understand your customer’s lifecycle. Let’s quickly recap the four general stages of the customer lifecycle (for a more detailed breakdown, read Chapter 4 in the book — Mastering Product Experience in SaaS): How to Deliver Personalized Product Experience with Product-Led Go-to-Market Strategy:
So, why are we talking about the customer lifecycle? It’s easy to say that your customer acquisition strategy should be designed from the perspective of your customer rather than your company. But it’s incredibly hard to keep focusing on that. It’s especially hard in the SaaS industry, where you might be thinking that you sell to the organization and not to the individual. That’s why your sales organization is more likely to have created a sales process and not follow a buying process. The customer acquisition strategy zeros in on the first and second stages of the customer lifecycle, to ultimately drive a purchase.
A customer acquisition strategy is a plan for attracting and converting prospects into customers.
The four steps of a customer acquisition strategy:
SurveyMonkey designed a great customer acquisition process through a self-service option. I, as a prospect, went through the acquisition and adoption stages of the lifecycle on my own, with zero help from sales, marketing, or support. SurveyMonkey designed a customer acquisition process that allowed me to try the product, figure out how to use it in a matter of minutes, and complete the purchase with a few clicks.
For the purpose of this article, we will focus on determining which customer acquisition model is more fitting for SaaS organizations to encourage prospects to try the product. The two most common ways are freemium and free trial.
It should be obvious why a great deal of attention should be spent designing a customer acquisition strategy. However, let’s highlight the most important reasons to be certain. An effective customer acquisition strategy will:
Early-stage companies can potentially generate more interest and demand by providing a freemium option or a trial with minimum requirements and barriers for the prospect to try the product. If competitors require prospects to fill out long lead forms and go through complicated free trial flows, offering an easy-to-use, self-service trial can differentiate your company and boost your product growth.
CAC can be a silent killer of SaaS companies. When designing a customer acquisition strategy, it’s critical to keep in mind customer acquisition costs. It pays to think about simple, inexpensive ways to amplify your growth, such as by encouraging prospects to invite peers or share their experiences on social media. This is what growth marketing (or growth hacking) is all about: enabling your prospects and customers to share your product with their zones of influence. For example, every survey taker is a potential SurveyMonkey customer. SurveyMonkey makes it easy for prospects and customers to share with other potential survey takers.
As my experience with SurveyMonkey shows, an efficient self-service option can shorten the sales cycle significantly. Think about how long would it take if I first had to speak with sales and/or see a demo. A self-service option is not for every company. That said, the goal with a SaaS customer acquisition strategy should be to reduce the time it takes a prospect to realize product value and see the product in action.
The initial interaction between a prospect and the product is arguably the most important step in developing a long-term relationship with customers. That’s why designing for the first interaction should be part of your customer acquisition strategy. A great initial experience can be a powerful competitive differentiator and advantage.
Aside from the fact that prospects expect and often demand to try enterprise software much as they do consumer products, incorporating freemium or free trials in your customer acquisition strategy can help your company sell more effectively.
In fact, there are a few psychological reasons why inviting prospects to try your software can provide huge benefits for your organization. Let’s explore four.
In simple terms, the endowment effect describes when people attribute more value to things merely because they own them. Numerous studies have been done in this area by Dan Ariely, Daniel Kahneman, and Richard Thaler and others. What is surprising is that even “near ownership” as much as outright possession of the object makes us value it more. For example, in a classic experiment, a scientist gave coffee mugs to half of the students but left the other half empty-handed. Students that received coffee mugs were unwilling to sell them for less than $5.25, while those that hadn’t received a coffee mug were unwilling to pay more than $2.75.
So how does this relate to a customer acquisition strategy? Providing access to a free trial or free version of your product can increase the value of your product in the eyes of your prospects.
2. Behaviors Drive Attitudes
Traditionally, marketers have believed that brand loyalty drives behavior. But some recent studies suggest that familiarity breeds liking, and that usage also breeds familiarity and brand knowledge (which in turn breeds liking) (How Brands Grow by Byron Sharp). In other words, prior knowledge of the brand makes a person slightly more favorable towards it.
Letting potential customers experience your product early in the buying process can increase familiarity and usage. Even better is when prospects can experience your product without having to talk to anyone. This enables the prospect to have a greater engagement with your product, and in the long term, makes it more likely for the prospect to convert into a paying customer.
3. Loss Aversion
We fear loss more than we value gain. A loss of $100 costs you more in happiness compared to the happiness of receiving a $100. That’s why we often see marketing materials and messaging highlighting how customers can avoid negative outcomes instead of what can be gained from using the product. Like it or not fear, just like sex, sells.
That’s why so many companies gravitate to offering a free trial over a freemium — they know the end of the free trial is a powerful incentive for prospects to buy the product. In other words, loss aversion is the primary argument in favor of a free trial.
4. Effort vs Impact
What kind of effort will your prospects have to spend to try your product and then to buy? And what kind of impact (or benefit) should your user expect in return? Whatever approach your company uses to design an initial product-prospect interaction, it’s critical to understand how different types of prospect efforts map to different benefits to your company.
The framework below shows how likely a prospect is to try / buy the product based on the level of effort it takes versus the perceived impact on them.
High Effort + Low Impact = “No way will I try your product!”
Low Effort + Low Impact = “Maybe I will try”
High Effort + High Impact = “Maybe I will try”
Low Effort + High Impact = “YES, please!” (“Shut up and take my money” category)
Interestingly enough, the fastest-growing companies of the last generation of SaaS (e.g., Slack, Asana, Zoom) all fall under the Low Effort / High Impact category. But not all enterprise SaaS products fit the low effort category. Some are very complex and require significant effort on the part of customers to set up and integrate into their organization to realize product value.
Where do you think your product fits in terms of the effort it takes to try and buy it versus the perceived impact on prospects and their organizations? While it’s important you figure that out, the question is more complicated and we will try to provide a few guideposts on how to decide whether a free trial or freemium is right for your organization.
If your SaaS company is not offering a free trial or freemium, it is missing out on many sales opportunities. A study by Forrester has shown that B2B buyers prefer to self-educate rather than talk to a sales representative to learn about a product by a factor of three to one.
With more prospects preferring a self-service option, SaaS companies can improve the buying experience and drive more revenues by providing options to try a product early in the buying process. Free trials and freemiums are the most direct way of showing the value of a product and guiding prospects to their first “Aha!” moment — when they experience and realize that value. When done right, this strategy not only improves the customer experience, it also shortens the sales cycle and reduces customer acquisition cost.
SurveyMonkey designed a customer acquisition model that made it easy for me to try the product and pay just 30 minutes later. Their customer acquisition cost was almost zero (I’m not counting the huge effort and resources to build brand recall in the last decade) and the sales cycle lasted 30 minutes.
That’s why some very successful companies in the subscription era — including Trello, Zoom.us, and Asana — lead their customer acquisition process by providing a free trial or freemium.
So, how does a SaaS company determine whether a free trial or freemium option is best?
First, note that free trials and freemiums are not solely reserved for low-margin products. Companies offering a premium product can use the freemium model, as these industry leaders do: Slack, Dropbox, Atlassian, inVision, and Zenefits, to name a few.
Now let’s define each model to ensure everyone is on the same page. Some define freemium and free trials as pricing models. But as we argued in “Mastering Product Experience in SaaS: How to Deliver Personalized Customer Experiences with a Product-led Go-to-market Strategy,” both are more customer acquisition strategies than pricing models.
Freemium is a customer acquisition model that provides access to part of a software product to prospects free of charge, without a time limit.
Free trial is a customer acquisition model that provides a partial or complete product to prospects free of charge for a limited time. Typically, a free trial runs for 14 or 30 days.
Freemium and free trial are popular customer acquisition strategies with companies that use a product-led go-to-market strategy, meaning those that leverage their product as a leading go-to-market channel. Freemium and free trial strategies are critical because they enable prospects to interact with the product for the first time. And that first interaction will set expectations and, ultimately, lead to a signup-to-customer conversion in the freemium model or a trial-to-customer conversion.
Very often we see companies structuring freemiums using a few parameters to limit the usage (a few examples):
Examples of companies that limit their freemiums using multiple variables:
#1 Dropbox (enterprise): Capacity + feature-limited (link)#2 Slack: Feature limited (link)#3 Asana: Seat limited (15 people) + feature-limited (link)#4 inVision: Usage limited (1 prototype) (link)#5 Hubspot (link): CRM — Free unlimited, Sales — Feature limited#6 Zoom.us: Feature + Seat + Bandwidth (link)#7 Amplitude: Bandwidth (engagement) + feature-limited (link)#8 Heap Analytics: Bandwidth (engagement) + feature-limited (link)#9 Mixpanel: Bandwidth (engagement) + feature-limited (link)
Compare the Tradeoffs: The Pros and Cons of Freemium and Free Trial
Next, let’s consider the tradeoffs between freemium and free trial models. Some companies don’t support a freemium strategy because it can cost too much to serve free customers, yet many companies find the freemium model effective. Remember: a freemium product does not limit the amount of time a prospect can access the software, but often limits users in some way, such as through stripped-back features or allowed amount of usage. Slack employs a freemium model, and so do Zoom.us, Dropbox, and Asana. Companies such as Atlassian, Github, and Twilio focused on the developer market also start with a freemium.
The pros and cons of freemium and free trial are highlighted in the table below:
When deciding whether a free trial or freemium strategy is right for your company and product, we recommend estimating the size of the addressable market. Jason M. Lemkin outlines the math behind making freemium work in his article, “Why You Need 50 Million Active Users for Freemium to Actually Work”. The main point that Jason is trying to make is that total addressable market is a result of product price and complexity. Highly-priced and more complex products have a lesser total addressable market; for example, software for a nuclear reactor. Lower priced and less complex products have a larger total addressable market.
Low Price + Low Complexity = Freemium (and self-service option) is the most suitable option.
High Price + Low Complexity = Freemium is a good option because the cost of servicing free customers is still low.
High Price + High Complexity = Free Trial could be a better option since a product with higher complexity requires a more complicated setup and/or more time-consuming onboarding.
Low Price + High Complexity = AVOID. This is an extremely tough spot to be in, as your team has to either redesign the product to deliver more value so it can be priced higher, or find a way to deliver value with a less complex solution.
Note: we are assuming here that a higher price is correlated with a higher cost of servicing customers. Update 1/19/2018: great article by Joel York on Three SaaS Sales Models.
According to Tomasz Tunguz, “Freemium funnels typically convert only 2 to 4% of users who try the product. At $10 per seat per month, a startup needs about 10M accounts converting at 4% to reach $50M in revenue. At $100 per seat per month, a startup needs 100,000 accounts.”
Suffice it to say, the addressable market needs to be large enough to make it worth your while, and enable you to be profitable while only converting a relatively small percent of free users.
Freemium Considerations
Companies can structure a freemium offering many ways, including feature-limited, capacity-limited, seat-limited, customer-class-limited, support-limited, and time or bandwidth limited. Lincoln Murphy’s article provides a good overview of seven types of freemiums to consider.
Freemium makes sense when your organization has:
If your company meets these criteria, freemium may be the way to go.
Note: Make sure you articulate how different the user experience is between free and paid versions — prospects need to know what they’re missing. Perhaps a freemium makes sense for your business. But, consider a free trial strategy before making a choice.
Free Trial Considerations
The goal of the free trial is to deliver as much value as possible to users during a short period. For the purpose of this discussion, we will concentrate on an ungated free trial strategy, which means a user can sign up and start a trial without talking to a sales rep. With gated free trials, users request access to the product and get approved by a sales or sales development representative. An ungated free trial is essentially a self-service version of the traditional Proof of Concept (PoC).
Important questions to answer before deciding whether a free trial strategy is right for your organization:
An effective trial signup includes a simple, guided journey that is painless and immediate. Think of a free trial as a chance for users to test drive your product like they would a new car, on their own, seeing how it handles when driven to their favorite or most-visited places. Picture them taking it on a winding back road and pushing it on the freeway. There’s no salesman with these prospects, but the guide makes sure the journey takes them where they need to go to experience the right “Aha!” moment.
The cost of servicing users is the biggest factor in deciding whether or not to provide a free trial or free version of your product. If the cost of servicing free trial or freemium customers isn’t offset by paying customers, nothing else matters.
Goals
Types
Features
To select what features should be part of your freemium or free trial, we recommend you to go through the Importance vs Satisfaction framework highlighted by Dan Olsen in his The Lean Product Playbook, and shown below.
This framework lets product teams decide not only what features to include in the roadmap but also how to categorize them into Must-haves, Performance benefits, and Delighters. To build a successful product, companies have to implement all Must-haves, and focus on one Performance benefit where the product outperforms competitors’ offerings, and one Delighter, a feature that is completely unique offering. However, your freemium or free trial offering can include a Must-have features but limit features that provide performance benefits and delight customers.
Duration
While the duration of a free trial can vary, 30-day and 14-day trials are among two of the most popular options. You can make a good argument for shorter and longer free trials. The ultimate length of your free trial is usually dependent on your product’s complexity. Here is interesting research by the team at MadKudu, which found the duration of a free trial had little impact on the ultimate outcome.
Cost
Think of the cost to serve free users as your customer acquisition costs. Say a freemium option increases your product signups and conversion rates. In that case, it might be better to spend a little more of your marketing resources to nurture existing users instead of acquiring new signups through more expensive channels like ads.
Buyer Personas
It’s important to understand the buying process of your target companies and personas. In many cases free trials and freemium speak more directly to end-users of your product than to the decision-maker or budget owner. In other words, free trials and freemium are more appealing to end-users since they will be the ones to use your product on a daily (hopefully) basis.
Signup Process and Requirements
It pays to map out the initial customer journey and what actions will deliver the first value to users. For example, Asana can drive newly signed up users to create the first project and invite teammates. Achieving this in the initial signup process ensures users understand the product value.
Customer Journey to Initial Value
Usage Frequencies
It might be tricky to understand why frequency of use might be an important factor in deciding between freemium vs free trial. If your product solves one of the top three challenges for your target audience, then it’s easier for the prospect to become a daily user. But what if your software enables people to send newsletters and most companies send only weekly or monthly newsletters (for example, Revue, a simple solution to build beautiful newsletters)? In that case, a standard 14-day or 30-day trial only allows users to test your product a few times during the free-trial period.
Maybe that’s why Revue provides a free product if your subscriber list is no more than 250 contacts. Now compare a product like that with low usage frequencies with a product like marketing automation that can be used on a daily basis. A 30-day trial allows users to learn your product and use it on a daily basis if needed.
Nurturing
Nurturing free users is probably the main reason why many argue that a freemium model doesn’t work. It is not effective to just offer a free product and hope that users will upgrade to paid at some point. More on this later.
Metrics
In order to design an effective customer acquisition process using a freemium or free-trial process, SaaS companies must go through the list of questions above. The goal is to ensure that the decision was well thought out and that an implementation plan is in place. Now, let’s discuss why some companies fail with a freemium model.
Let’s review a few of the most common reasons why SaaS companies fail with a freemium model.
#1 Provide no or little incentive for free customers to convert
Giving away too much of the product is one way to fail with freemium. Assuming that the cost to service free customers is low, companies must strike a careful balance. They need to provide access to just enough of the product to continuously derive value but not quite enough to eliminate the incentive for users to buy the product. The goal of the freemium is to entice customers to increase product usage and essentially to convert to a paid subscription.
#2 Don’t deliver enough value
If you provide features that are of low importance to the user, or limit you free version to the level where no value can be extracted from the product, you will most likely fail. Even if you provide your product free of charge, users still have to derive some value from it. For example, if SurveyMonkey allowed just one question per free survey, it’s unlikely anyone would find enough value to use the tool. What’s more, fewer survey responders would be exposed to the SurveyMonkey product and brand.
#3 Don’t create a sense of urgency
One of the main criticisms of the freemium model is that it doesn’t create a sense of urgency. A free trial expires, which creates urgency for users to invest the time to use and learn about the product value. However, companies can craft freemiums that highlight the urgency factor.
Analyze your freemium users and categorize them into three buckets:
1. Not ideal customer to get the full value for your product
2. Too small with no budget
3. Ideal customer with a budget but low usage
No matter how good your product is, it will never be the case that everyone finds enough value to buy it. Thus, not everyone is an ideal customer. Plus, not everyone has a budget. These free customers can still love your product and share positive reviews. They can be influencers and promote your product and related content across social media but conversion to paid customers might never happen. Therefore, focus on building urgency with the third category of free users who fit your ideal customer profile, have the budget, but most likely do not yet use your product enough to pay for it.
You can create the urgency by communicating about new premium features that deliver more value or by highlighting the value missed by not having access to a premium subscription.
#4 Don’t nurture and engage continuously with prospects, resulting in a lower free-to-paid conversion rate
Too many companies overlook the importance of nurturing free customers while highlighting the differences between their free and paid versions. Instead, they rely on the idea that free customers will understand the product value and will convert themselves over time or as their needs grow. Companies have to continuously educate users on how they can get more benefits from the paid version of the product. It’s worth it to educate about new releases and product upgrades.
#5 Don’t track and analyze insights on how and why customers convert
This is related to the previous point. Companies need to outline a clear path to take free users to paid customers. It’s a mistake to think that free users don’t need to be analyzed or tracked. First, tracking free users can help you understand target customers better and create data-driven research content. For example, say your product tracks mobile app performance and collects uptime and the most common issues related to downtime. Your company could use this data to create an industry report showcasing uptime for each mobile app category. This type of customer usage-driven content is extremely effective in marketing and PR.
#6 Don’t provide appropriate onboarding experience
Even with the free version of your product, users will need to learn how to use your product. Remember, “empty state” or “zero data” is what prospects see during their initial signup process when no data is available in the product. Providing free access to your product that looks empty isn’t going to help you convert free users to paid customers. This is all part of onboarding, which is critical for successful product adoption and can also guide prospects through the steps to generate more data so they realize even more product value.
#7 Don’t evaluate the cost of supporting free customers
We talked about the cost of a freemium offering. It can quickly add up when considering all your costs, everything from cloud storage to support. Communicate to your users what’s included and excluded in the free version of the product. Ensure that your costs are manageable in the long term.
Don’t look at the Freemium model as a thing of the past, freemium in SaaS is might be here to stay.
It’s not always about either-or. I’m convinced that a hybrid approach between freemium and free trial can be an effective way to get the best of both options. Freemium can drive more demand but what if your company can’t provide all features because of the high cost to service free customers? Offering a full-featured free trial to select users can be an effective way to get the best of both worlds. Specifically, you can drive higher signups associated with the freemium model and create a sense of urgency due to a clear expiration date.
Let’s say a prospect signs up for a fully working, free trial of your product for a specified duration. At the end of the trial, part of the product is gated while allowing the prospect to use a freemium version for as long as they like. This makes it possible for prospects to use the free product and convert at a later date. It also creates urgency for the prospect to 1) try the full product capability, and 2) buy the product before the full trial capabilities are stripped down to the freemium version.
Lincoln Murphy provides an interesting perspective on the subject of using both freemium and free trial customer acquisition models. He advocates using two distinct calls-to-action and two paths to try the product with a hybrid model. However, I believe that it’s more effective to put up only one gate to your product so you can focus on one path and one call to action.
How do SaaS companies effectively acquire customers? This is one of the most essential and critical questions for companies to answer. Yet, you rarely see the go-to-market or customer acquisition strategy in startup pitching decks. Pitching decks usually go over problems the company is trying to solve, the solution, market size, competition, the business model, and pricing. We rarely see any explanations as to how companies plan to get to the first 10, 50, and 100 customers. But it’s arguably one of the most important topics for a startup to figure out.
The initial customer acquisition strategy might not work and may even be completely wrong. But it allows investors to analyze how the team plans to reach initial traction and empowers them with insights into how systematic and process-oriented the startup team is about acquiring customers.
This article only touched upon the basic elements of a customer acquisition strategy, zeroing in on the decision about whether to offer a freemium, free trial or a hybrid option. As you saw, there is no clear answer about which is the right approach because it varies case by case. The context of your market forces, competition, product, and even corporate culture all play into the decision. That said, the hybrid model might provide just enough compromise to capture the most pros and avoid many cons of freemium and free trial strategies.
The goal of this article is to help every SaaS company and every product team systematically evaluate options and their specific cases in order to design an effective and efficient customer acquisition strategy. The books and resources at the end of this article will help you learn more about this topic.

by Jay Kapadnis, Tempus Architect
The Twelve-Factor App Methodology is suggested by developers for smoothly working and delivering Software as a Service (SaaS) Applications or Web Apps with a focus on Microservices. For that reason, for purposes of this discussion, I will be using Service and Application interchangeably.
A Twelve-Factor App as described at 12factor.net will be:
1. Automated from a development perspective
2. Portable across execution environments
3. Deployable in the cloud minimizing the need for servers and server administration
4. Enabled for continuous deployment with minimal divergence between Dev and Prod
5. Scalable without significant change or effort
At Hashmap, we do our best to follow the methodology as much as possible, but reality dictates that sometimes we must deviate a bit due to limitations that are encountered. Regardless, it’s always a best practice to keep the Twelve-Factors top of mind while building SaaS applications and continue to reinforce why they matter.
So let’s explore the Twelve-Factors now…
An application codebase should always be tracked by a Version Control System (VCS). Widely popular in the development world is Git, and in today’s world you really can’t find a development team who are not using VCS. It provides substantial benefits such as code tracking and code versioning while also easing the collaboration of a development team working on the same application.
In general, you should always have one repository for an individual application to ease CI/CD pipelines, which we will discuss shortly. That being said, one service can have multiple running instances (official documentation terms it deploys).
Code should not be shared between applications — you can’t add dependencies of deployable services (think Spring Boot or Play applications) on each other. So, if there is common code you want to use across applications, create a repo for that code as a library, publish it to Maven, and integrate using Maven, sbt, Gradle or any other tool you prefer.
There are workflow tools which can help you manage your codebase till release, such as GitFlow (Release Management Workflow). Developers working with Extreme Programming Principles (frequent releases in short development cycles) generally don’t enjoy following these types of release management workflows — it’s an altogether different discussion for another day.
For any application you should not copy any dependencies to the project codebase, rather use dependency management tools to get the required project dependencies, declared in manifest, from the server.
If you consider Maven as dependency management tool, manifest will be pom.xml, which fetches dependencies as jar (artifacts) from various repositories (it’s a Maven repo not a Git repo).
There are times though when you will need to rely on few jars which are declared as a provided scope. In other words, you will need to assume their existence on server like tools.jar from JDK. Always ensure you use the correct versions of dependencies so that all environments are in sync and reproduce the same behavior. I can tell you from experience that it’s a nightmare to track issues that have occurred due to a mismatch in versions of dependencies on different environments.
For the Java/Scala world, there are tools such as sbt and gradle and they differ on the way the manifest is written to manage dependencies. Note that there are more differences, but the most obvious difference is manifest.
Backing services refer to the infrastructure and other services by which the application communicates over the network. Database, Message Brokers, other API-accessible consumer services such as Authorization Service, Twitter, GitHub etc., are loosely coupled with the application and treat them as resource.
You may be asking yourself, “So don’t all Microservices generally follow this principle — what’s new here, Jay”.
The difference here is that you must be able to easily swap the backing service from one provider to another without code changes.
For example, let’s take an app which acts as an Authorization Server supporting OAuth2 capability with it’s own database and we need to change it to different client database maintained on a different server. There should be no code changes done to the application — only configurations should be changed.
The focus is on Configurations over Conventions.
For use cases like this, it can be easy when using something like Spring JPA, but you can’t try to code for each and every possible competing technology used in an application, that’s really unrealistic.
In order to solve for this challenge, we generally suggest coding to Interfaces where you create a Façade which can be used by an application to integrate with backing services. Depending upon the configurations (e.g., in Spring Boot .yml file) we can inject the appropriate backing service at runtime. A Plugin based architecture also provides a way to add support for different types of services using a Façade to an application.
The reality is though that most applications can’t be 12 Factor apps if this is a “rule” vs an “exception”. Do your best to avoid over-engineering your application if it’s not necessary. Make a judicious call on supporting backing services depending upon the need of the business and project itself.
Configurations are a central part of any application, specifically when there is a need to support multiple environments or clients. Use cases are as follows:
· Database connection properties
· Backing services credentials and connection information
· Application environment specific information such as Host IP, Port, etc.
The assumption is that all configuration are stored in .config, .yml, .json or .properties (depending upon the framework you are using to build your application) and not in the code.
There should be a strict separation between config and code. Code should remain the same irrespective of where the application is being deployed, but configurations can vary.
So the rule of thumb is, Properties, which vary depending upon the environment or client, should go into config files as in the examples above. REST endpoints/API (URI) and other components that don’t vary can be safely put into the code.
In order to achieve the above, most frameworks support the use of System Environment variables inside configuration files. For instance, in the Spring Boot yaml file you can write:
Security.oauth2.client.clientSecret: ${CL_SERVICE_PASSWORD}
The above assumes that CL_SERVICE_PASSWORD is set as a sys env variable for deployment. Similar approaches apply to the Play Framework as well.
This enables you to ensure that no sensitive information is exposed within the codebase and you can customize depending on the environment where the application is deployed. Maven also provides a feature of “profiles” which can be used to toggle between deployments such as dev, test, staging, and production.
A twelve-factor application requires a strict separation between Build, Release and Run stages. Let’s look at each stage in detail.
Build
The Build phase takes code from VCS and builds an executable bundle. For Java/Scala environments, it’s mostly JAR, though with Spring Boot you can generate executables such as deb, rpm, etc. For now, I’ll focus on JAR.
Ideally, this stage should also take care of executing all Unit Tests available in an application. If tests fail, then the entire process should be abandoned as you don’t want a failing application deployed.
This can be assumed as Continuous Integration (CI) where code from the VCS is continuously pulled as and when changed by a team member and built on a server. Make sure your builds are fast to get quicker feedback since this is a stage that tends to fail.
Release
In this stage, an executable build is combined with environment specific configurations, assigned a unique release number, and made ready to execute on the environment.
Run
Finally, the package is executed on an environment using the necessary execution commands. This can be seen as Continuous Deployment once pipeline and all previous stages pass.
The typical Development Pipeline is depicted below:
Every deployment, whether Dev, QA, Stage, or Prod needs to follow all stages mentioned earlier. Software deployment through this lifecycle is quick, continuous, and without any manual intervention. Tools that help in achieving a full CI/CD pipeline are Jenkins, Thoughtworks go, and Codeship to name a few.
This factor is focused on executing the app as one or more stateless processes. A Process is an application running on server. An Application can be deployed with multiple instances/processes depending upon the network traffic. Generally, a load balancer is used to manage traffic and route to an app instance, which enables quick request handling.
We can’t guarantee consecutive requests from the same client will go on the same instance. For this reason, we prefer not to rely on data of previously processed requests. Think about this in terms of User Session information.
With multi-node deployments in the Cloud when application scaling can be automated it’s best never to rely on data written on the file system or data in memory because you can’t be sure that it will be available or accessible to all nodes. A failure could cause data to get wiped out or be made inaccessible.
You can use the file system for brief periods of time in the same request, and to achieve this:
· Use a database to store state if needed for subsequent requests
· Avoid using sticky-session, and instead use scalable cache stores such as Memcached or Redis for storing session information
· Package assets in executables (e.g. by using webjars at build time)
Unlike some web apps that are executed inside a webserver container, a Twelve-Factor acts as a standalone service and is self contained meaning it doesn’t rely on any existing/running application server to get executed. This implies that the Port on which the application is connected to is also stored in Config (discussed earlier).
Spring Boot can really assist here so that we can use embedded Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow using the dependency manifest (pom.xml). Additionally, the Play framework comes with AKKA-HTTP and Netty server.
This approach also helps in Backing Services communication.
As mentioned earlier, Process as a first-class citizen of a twelve-factor app. Concurrency is a bit redundant with the Process factor, but the key point is that because of Processes, Concurrency is simple and reliable. Here are some guidelines for Concurrency:
· Don’t rely too much on threads in an application as vertical scaling can be limited for process running on server
· Adhere to Process guidelines to achieve Horizontal Scaling
· Don’t daemonize or write PID for app process as the platform process manages handle processes better
Processes in twelve-factor apps should be started or stopped in minimal time. As we discussed in Build above, processes should be less time consuming. Similarly Run and Stop should be minimal to avoid catastrophic failures between different applications working as backing services.
Consider the example of a retail website which has services such as web-app, auth-service, catalogue-service, order-service, etc. In the case of failure of a process of order-service, the user should still be able to access the website and eventually within no time should be able to order immediately as order-service comes up.
Disposability is also about keeping HTTP requests short which sometimes is not possible. In the case of WebSocket connections, if data is streamed continuously to the client, and the connection is lost, this adds responsibility on the client to seamlessly attempt to reconnect.
The implicit message in this factor is to provide resiliency and automated scaling of application processes, which is generally easier to achieve with Cloud and Containerized deployments.
Your development environment should be as similar to your Production environment as possible. Twelve-factor applications are designed for continuous deployments by keeping less gaps between production and development environments. This is done to avoid unforeseen issues once an application goes live when the app was working fine on the development environment — this doesn’t necessarily mean having same the OS on both environments.
This also implicitly encourages a DevOps culture where Software Development and Operations are unified. Containerization is a huge help here for the developer enabling an ability to simulate the production environment and bridge any gaps.
Twelve-factor apps should not be concerned about routing and storage of it’s output stream or writing/managing logfiles — the app will write it’s event stream to stdout.
There are plenty of logging frameworks available for Java/Scala., solutions such as SLF4J with logback that can manage logs really well plus aggregation frameworks like graylog or logstash to gather logs and provide analytics plus alarming capabilities. You can also perform analysis of logs using tools like ELK stack.
You can customize depending on the environment using configurations. There are times when a developer might want to have different log levels and see logs on stdout in the development environment.
Twelve-factor apps aim to run admin/management tasks as one-off processes — tasks like database migration or executing one-off scripts in the environment.
This seems ok if it’s really a one-off task but what if your database migration is a periodic task and you need to handle it with schedulers and perform it automatically.
Also for one-off tasks, ideally these should be handled before the application process start-up. It’s better to make it part of an automated process so that you don’t need to execute scripts manually on all servers and it’s identical across the board.
This also promotes having Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL) languages for an application — take into consideration how many times these one-off commands will be executed.
We have seen how twelve-factors can make the development to release process hassle free and predictive with higher scalability and we are experiencing this daily with our ongoing development of the Tempus IIoT Cloud-Edge-ML Framework.
There are times where it makes sense to deviate from a few of the factors such Backing Services and Logs, but it’s best to adhere to all Twelve-Factors as much as possible.
In future posts, I’ll do my best to combine the Twelve-Factor methodology and concepts with Microservices architectures, Cloud Computing, and Containerization — stay tuned!

This post is part of our series covering the SaaS industry. You can find all our SaaS related stories on the P9 Capital Medium Channel.
A couple of months ago I wrote an article highlighting 3 trends in the SaaS industry and one of them, “Unbundling of SaaS”, lead to some interesting discussions that I want to sum up here.
By “unbundling of SaaS” I refer to the increasing number of startups which are offering software packaged as an API instead of a traditional finished product.
A good example is the “support” vertical with several products like supportive.io or supportify.io which “API-fied” the features of traditional support software (like Zendesk) so that you can create your own support experience without having to code everything from scratch.
And an increasing number of products are unbundling more and more traditional SaaS features in different verticals (marketing, analytics, support, accounting, sales…)
Check the “unbundling of SaaS” branch on this mindmap for more examples.
Traditional API startups like Stripe, Sendgrid, Twilio etc… are more “infrastructure” APIs which help developers build the “core” features of their product (I need a search on my website so I’ll use Algolia, I need to send emails so i’ll use Sendgrid, I need to accept payment so I’ll use Stripe) which can differ from the APIs I’m speaking about:
The first question which comes to mind is the question of the “need”. Is there a real need for such products?
Potential use cases:
So yes, there are needs, but the market still requires to be evangelized (especially #1 and #2) and it’s not clear whether these are “niche” problems or not.
These products are API first but they probably cannot skip creating a “killer” app that people can use out of the box and later convert them to their API (Fullcontact is a good example for that)

We’ve seen a wide range of CEO salaries in our portfolio, from as low as $35k annually to as much as $400k (plus bonus). While there is no dataset explicitly outlining salary levels at early stage SaaS companies, we can use the salaries from tech companies at their IPO to get a sense for what the salary should be for a successfully exiting CEO. The data below shows the salaries of 87 SaaS company CEO’s at IPO.
A few observations stand out:
Some of the best CEO’s take the lowest salaries. Marc Benioff of Salesforce took a salary of $1 at IPO, Patrick Shiong of Nant Health took no salary, Dustin Moskovitz from Asan took $1, and Thomas Siebel of C3 gets paid about $6k. These individuals were independently wealthy before the IPO, but it is refreshing to see a CEO pass up a big salary if they can. It sets an example for the rest of the company, establishes a culture of cash frugality, and shows a founder putting the company ahead of themselves. Founders taking low salaries also show very well when going to raise money. VC would much rather back a scrappy, frugal founder than one that spends gratuitously and the CEO salary tells you a lot about the CEO’s mantra.
$320k is the median for a very successful company. Keep in mind, the median salary of $319,292 is for the CEO of a SaaS company about to go public. In other words, these companies were all tremendously successful up to the point of going public, yet the CEO’s salary was still lower than that we’ve seen for some venture backed large startups. Be sure to temper your salary accordingly based on the stage of your company.
Other forms of comp include options and bonuses. Note the median bonus was $125k and median option grant had a value of $84k. A performance bonus annually is expected, and a founder will be granted stock as the Company matures and becomes more successful, especially if their salary is low (note the average options comp is $4.7mm).
Before the IPO, some of the founders took options worth fantastic sums. Drew Houston at Dropbox took options worth $109mm the year before IPO. Ryan Smith at Qualtrics took $142mm. As a CEO, so long as you’re driving fantastic growth and value, it’s not out of line to expect additional option grants. Good investors have no problem rewarding CEOs that are performing.
We hope the data above is helpful in setting salary expectations. Keep it as low as possible, expect option grants and bonuses for success, and keep in mind the real source of value is your equity.

The ease of deployment, business model, and efficiencies offered by SaaS have transformed how companies of all sizes do business. As a result, for more than a decade SaaS has attracted billions in venture funding and inspired thousands of entrepreneurs to launch new products. But only in recent years have we seen an explosion in adoption broadly in small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), across a variety of industries and a spectrum of departments.
Blissfully helps hundreds of companies effortlessly manage their SaaS vendors, across thousands of subscriptions and millions of monthly spend. This gives us a unique position to evaluate SaaS trends, especially for small and medium businesses. While various studies have explored SaaS usage across large enterprises, there is little data on SMBs. Our companies have on average just under 100 employees. Furthermore, we aggregate real world SaaS spending and usage data (not just surveys), going back eight years, providing some great insights into the evolution of SaaS.
As we dug into the data, a few trends emerged. SaaS usage is truly accelerating across businesses in general, with the adoption of paid SaaS subscriptions rising over 4x in the last 20 years to more than 20 products for an average SMB. SaaS has taken root across all functions and departments, as non-engineering SaaS spend rose from about 10% in 2010 to over 80% today. The number of SaaS offerings and vendors have exploded along with this rise in adoption and spread throughout the organization.
These trends have big implications for everyone in the SaaS ecosystem, from investors to builders to consumers.
Today, the average SMB uses 20 paid SaaS products across their organization. This number has increased dramatically in the last two years, quadrupling since 2015. The rate of adoption of SaaS products by the SMB doubled after 2014. From 2010 to 2014, the average SMB averaged a 2.7% monthly growth rate in the number of SaaS products adopted across the organization. This monthly growth rate increased substantially to 5.4% after 2014.
In just two years time, the average SMB has quadrupled its spending on SaaS products across the organization. Today, the average SMB spends just over $15,500 every month on SaaS products. Annualized, this equates to over $186,000 per SMB. Dramatic increases in spending began in 2014, increased substantially every quarter through 2016, and continues to rise today.
SaaS products are being utilized by nearly every business function across the organization. In 2010, paid SaaS products leveraged by engineering dominated 90% of the average SMBs usage, down to just 20% today. Sales and Business Ops each now account for approximately 20%. Marketing and Dev Ops are each about 10% of spending, with Marketing holding steady since 2010, and Dev Ops rising from zero spending in 2012. Finally, HR, Finance, Product, and Customer Support have all come from nearly zero spending five years ago to account for about 3% each.
As SaaS proliferates across all business functions, it also means that the management and ownership of these subscriptions are increasingly distributed. Our data shows that 1 in 7 employees is managing (e.g. being the billing owner) for a SaaS subscription for their organization. Pushing SaaS ownership and management throughout the organization is empowering and can lead to better products and decisions. However, this can also lead to SaaS chaos, creating potential security risks and financial waste. In fact, this trend of SaaS ownership moving outside of IT’s control is a big reason why we started Blissfully.
While Silicon Valley is known as the hub of venture capital investment, the majority of top paid SaaS products leveraged by the SMB are headquartered outside of Silicon Valley.
The top products by market share show a huge variety of business functions, further supporting the point above that SaaS has really permeated all business functions. In the top 25, we see a lot of the usual well-established players: G Suite, GitHub, AWS, Slack, Salesforce, HubSpot, Office 365. We also saw a lot of companies focused on the marketing stack, MailChimp, Moz, Unbounce, complemented by data enrichment and syncing pair Segment + Clearbit. You’ll also notice a lot of the companies we highlighted in our recommended Startup SaaS Stack appearing here in the top 25 (and top 50 in the full report), including G Suite, Github, Zapier, eShares, Gusto, and Zoom. This shouldn’t be a surprise, that’s part of the reason we recommended them!
The data in this report underscores the recent SaaS explosion in SMBs, on both spend and usage fronts. This impacts everyone in the SaaS ecosystem: builders, investors, and consumers. Here are some key takeaways for each group.
If you’re building and selling SaaS products, the upwards trends in this report set the stage for continued disruption and opportunity. However, this also means the competition will be fierce as more and more products are available to the SMB across numerous industries and functions.
The opportunity in SaaS is strong as niche products disrupt otherwise one-size-fits-all offerings, new business models ease SMB adoption, and new products cater to more functions across the SMB. Regardless, the competition for new entrants will be tough, making speed and quality of execution critical to success.
SaaS products will continue to proliferate and offer a range of meaningful value propositions across your organization. Expect continued increases in usage and spending, and more SaaS options and vendor choices than ever before. While SaaS offers many benefits for your business, it is also overwhelming to evaluate and manage ever-increasing options from a cost efficiency, security, training, and IT management perspective. SaaS management is more critical than ever. Luckily that’s why Blissfully exists, to help simplify SaaS management.

Be the first to respond.
People make psychological judgments quickly. So, how products are priced matters.
Pricing is one of the most important strategies that can determine how (and if) a SaaS business grows.
Over the last 3 years, ProfitWell, Chargebee, ChartMogul and a number of other businesses who focus on finance platforms for the SaaS industry, released several studies, reports, and plain fashion advice on how SaaS businesses should think and do in regards to their SaaS pricing.
Since then, I’ve analyzed hundreds of articles on the topic and thought: “Why not bringing the most relevant discussions, all under one roof?”.
That’s what the following story is about.
PS: If you end up liking what I’ve done here, give me at least a dozen claps for good luck :)
There’s an expression I’ve read in an article from Patrick Campbell and loved it ever since:
“The beauty of the subscription model is that relationships are built right into the revenue model. You provide consistent value to your customers, and in turn, they continue to pay you for that value. No other business model in history gives us, entrepreneurs, such alignment with their customers.”
This, for me, shows the evolution of a traditional sales model that would charge high for a product, pour their resources on marketing for the selling stage and forget about the rest of the customer journey. Saas doesn’t work this way. If you want your customer to pay up, you’ll need to continuously drive your product forward, engage with your customer base and ensure satisfaction with the service.
Curiously enough, as reported by PriceIntelligently, working with your current customer base, to increase the value they get from your product and consequently better monetize it — is still a topic rather undervalued, when compared with content about Acquisition for instance.
The same report shows that while Acquisition topics account for over 3/4 of publications from 2014–2016, Monetization actually 4x’s the impact of Acquisition on a product’s growth.
There is no way to build a sustainable SaaS business on new customer acquisition alone. — Paymotion
The beauty of SaaS brings the beauty of Unit Economics with it.
As Brian Balfour mentions on his “Why Product Market Fit Isn’t Enough” article, finding your Market-Product-Channel-Model fit begins with your Market. That’s exactly where your strategy for monetization should begin with. Understanding your audience and quantifying your buyer personas
Once you understand who your audience is and what should it be, once you figure out which can be your channels and finally how can you shape your product around them, it’s time to define your model. Here’s where Pricing comes in.
PriceIntelligently also mentions that:
The average amount of time spent on pricing amongst companies is a mere 8 hours total over the life of the business.
The same way the beauty of SaaS comes with a continuous market and product evolution, the balance which Balfour talks about, needs to be nurtured and therefore its components reviewed on a regular basis.
So, along with having a clear process in place, and a workgroup which involves the several teams at your company, it is crucial for this working group to meet regularly (every 2 months) to analyze current performance, (every 3 months) to suggest improvements and (every 6 months) to review the pricing strategy in place and apply changes.
Deciding on which direction should your business take in terms of pricing, involves:
The whole process of spending time thinking about your market-product-channel fit leads you to design the most important page on your website.
Your pricing page is where everything that matters to your business lives. All of the underlying unit economics of your business, the understanding of the value your audience sees in your product and the scaling mindset of pricing evolving with your customer growth, lives (or it should!) under the pricing strategy you set.
Therefore, designing it goes way beyond cosmetics and conversion optimization techniques. What follows are considerations to follow when defining your strategy and creating your Pricing Page.
Value metric. What is that?
After finding out the value your product brings, you need to find a usage metric within your product which you can tie to your customer’s business growth. Creating your pricing strategy around it will ensure customers get a much higher perceived value for upgrading to the next plan/tier.
Picking the proper value metric has a phenomenal impact on your business. Imagine two SaaS companies that each have 100 customers. The first charges on a per seat per month schema, but there’s little need for more than one seat for each customer. The other sells the exact same product but charges along a metric of particular usage in the app with a bare minimum per month charge. The former has an artificial ceiling on the MRR potentially gained from their customers. The latter’s MRR will grow as their customers grow and/or use the product more. I’d much rather be in company number 2. — PriceIntelligently
Your value metric, as we’ve seen above, is the quantifiable way your product provides value to your customers’ business. You provide a certain amount of functionality tied to value (like some number of emails, keyword searches, or users) and they pay you in return.
Going for a pricing strategy that revolves around this metric, ensures you’re driving expansion revenue, being able to increment the value you’re getting from your existing customers in the future.
If you don’t tie in your different pricing options to a scalable pricing model, it means you’ll have to work even harder on retention and acquisition initiatives to ensure business growth. While you can expand revenue in different ways (we’ll see that below), value-based pricing helps you scale the value you get from each contract at a similar rate as your customers scale their business, maintaining a consistent perceived value from what they’re getting from you.
A good example often quoted is Wistia’s.
Once you have come up with a pricing scheme, test it against this simple question: How comfortable will you feel when talking to your customer about your price versus the value you generate?
As a SaaS company grows its user base, a constant churn rate becomes an increasingly significant problem for continued growth.
Why?
The Growth in churn is geometric, while new customer acquisition is linear. As a result, it becomes impossible to offset churn purely by expanding your customer base and the revenue they generate.
Expanding revenue is basically pushing existent customers into spending more with your product.
The additional revenue you can generate from existing customers beyond initial fees is known as expansion revenue. — Paymotion
Likewise, while designing your pricing strategy with scaling in mind, you should consider opportunities to expand the revenue coming from that customer. If designed correctly, the pricing should scale down to allow you to capture the smallest/cheapest customers that are still profitable, up to the largest customers that are willing to pay a great deal.
Let’s take a look at some common axes for scaling pricing:
For a SaaS business, there are a few interesting ways one can do this:
The ideal scenario for any SaaS is to have its expanding revenues at higher levels than their churn. This is called Negative Churn and it basically means that you are expanding your customer base at a higher rate than what it is contracting — translating into exponential growth.
According to For Entrepreneurs, scaling your product pricing helps to attain a fit between your product packaging and the value your audience may get from it depending on which growth stage they find themselves at a specific moment in time.
Here are some examples of how different customers can get differing levels of value from your product:
Emotional Willingness to Pay, which plays a crucial role here, is also a topic much debated for already quite some time — it basically tells you that willingness-to-pay is actually based on perceived value and that by changing the perceived value, or simply by communicating your value more effectively, you can change willingness-to-pay.
Creating different pricing tiers comes as a result of understanding your customer base, by creating quantified buyer personas, how your customer base business evolves and what they value at each stage of their evolution, and then packaging it with a scalable price point.
All decisions about the pricing page are optimizations to approximate the value creation curve and charge for it. — Stripe Atlas
The “expected” design works for a reason. It’s often advisable to stick to Good, Better, Best — unless you’re targeting a large number of different personas.
Be creative when emphasizing your “preferred” plan. Either by using a different color, size, positioning or by smoothly animating its elements.
Understanding who your different customers are enables you to state who each plan is for, so do it. There’s no reason not to do this. This can also be aspirational — visitors will buy the plan that corresponds to what they want to be. Don’t call your plans Silver, Gold, Platinum — give them a name to which each of your customers can relate to (Freelancer, Small Studio, Large Studio).
Example of a job well done: Appcues
“Quantifying your buyer personas gives you concrete starting points for your pricing and packaging, showing you exactly what your customers value, and what they are willing to pay. As long as you price within that range and tier out your packages correctly, you will have customers.” — PriceIntelligently
ChartMogul brings a great annual review on Top SaaS Pricing pages on Pinterest. Worth checking out.
Read Profitwell’s “The Saddest SaaS Pricing Pages” to get a glimpse into what you should avoid.
With today’s global markets and easy access to economic reports, it shouldn’t be hard for businesses to price their products differently according to the top regions where they operate. This, according to Chargebee findings with ProfitWell, can be done in many different ways, from simple to more complex approaches:
— — — — a) Determine Each Region’s Willingness to Pay: Running price sensitivity campaigns is the easiest way to measure differing willingness to pay in each region.
— — — — b) Understand Your Buyer Personas: This takes a bit of extra work, but by understanding the different aspects of your product that resonate in different places, you’ll be able to figure out your market’s preferences and position your product differently for each region.
— — — — c) Cosmetic Localization: You’ll still need to ensure your landing page and currency symbols are appropriately set up for each region.
Freemium is a trend with SaaS businesses. It provides a no-friction way for users to signup with your product in the hope to make them move towards higher plans in the future.
There is however the growing conscience that products that offer products slightly above zero, will have a hard time growing and with the exception of some big names, today will never achieve major growth. Why? Because low ARPU products need to be distributed through low CAC channels in order to be profitable. Low CAC channels are typically virality and a bit higher up paid. Unless you’re able to get massive distribution through an incredible viral effect built into your product, you’re betting on a customer who is not willing to spend anything, to move through your pricing tiers towards a higher ARPU product tier.
Typical issues with Freemium model:
sixteenventures.com
Types of Freemium models:
Considerations for choosing a Freemium model:
Chargebee lists the following scenarios for when a Freemium model makes sense:
Ultimately, it all comes down to how well you understand the value that you’re bringing forth to the market, and how well it aligns with the freemium model.
Dan Martell sums it up in four crisp points, and says that you’ll have to get 3 of them right, to evaluate if the freemium model will work for you:
An interesting alternative to Freemium is Cheapium. Check the “Freemium is a Money Burning Business Model, Cheapium is Better” to learn more about it.
Cheapium works by offering basic features for a nominal cost, usually a dollar or less, while charging a premium for advanced features. This can be in the form of a one-time or recurring fee. Cheapium creates a low, but not trivial, barrier to entry. All users in the system are paying. It might sound like a small difference but this has several advantages over freemium.
Finally, several B2B businesses such as Hubspot, have realized that pure Freemium (no touch before the sale happens) has proved not to be great for increasing deal size. So instead, they are using Inside Sales to qualify their Freemium leads when they hit things such as hard-limits or make small initial purchases. This has really helped them to scale deals size whereas otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to do so. You can read more about it on OpenView article “Why Product Qualified Leads are the Answer to a Failing Freemium Model”

Considering whether you should offer a trial version of your product? That depends on your audience, product and can influence the level of touch you have on your sales process.
If you decide to go for a trial, consider those 7–15–30 days as a chance to convert the user to stick with your product and ideally moving into a paid subscription.
The free trial is a staple of most B2B SaaS solutions — many visitors will look for the trial signup button — a cry of “just let me see the thing” rather than digging around in marketing pages. This is fine, provided you can give a great self-service trial experience to customers.
You’ll need a great onboarding plan, whether it is automated or manual has to do with how easy it is to explain, and how much of the basics your audience already has.
Some of the learnings regarding Trials, from ChartMogul:
Most B2B SaaS companies find that removing the credit card requirement increases the number of free trial signups they get but decreases the activation rate (the number of users who make material use of the software) and conversion rate to paying use. It is generally not worth it early in the lifecycle of your company. (Your business needs to be capable operationally of doing fairly sophisticated work to nurture customers to activation and then convince them to part with their credit card details later in the trials for it to win net here.) — Stripe Atlas
“[The goal of a free trial is to] quickly get the prospect to a point where becoming a paying customer is the most logical next step… [which is] immediately after your customer achieves (or sees that they could actually achieve) their desired outcome by actually using the product.” — Lincoln Murphy
Lincoln Murphy touches the aha-moment concept with his observation. Designing your trial onboarding process to make sure your trial customer achieves the aha-moment as quick as possible — and for this, you need to be able to measure how long they are taking to do it on your normal plans, “trim the fat” by simplifying processes and shortcutting steps, asking for feedback when the user becomes stuck, welcome email from the founder and exit feedback survey to continuously iterate on the process.
One other current has a different perspective on Trials and Freemium models:
By not offering the free trial, PopSurvey founder Josh Pigford believes that PopSurvey forced prospective customers to do more research before they signed up. Ultimately, that’s allowed the business to attract a higher quality batch of educated customers whose expectations better align with what PopSurvey’s product delivers.
“In my mind,” Pigford explains, “that’s not some sort of rogue idea that will only work for our company. It’s a very reasonable, quality-driven customer acquisition strategy that I think many SaaS businesses could benefit from.”
By offering time-based money back guarantee to your customers, you’re not only sending the message that you trust your product’s value, but you’re also qualifying your users by adding a minimal entry barrier as well as giving yourself the chance to speak to your customer if and once they ask for their money back.
Also a great debate around the industry. Customer retention is the key to profitability in SaaS, and customers who churn out can waste a considerable portion of the cash you spend to acquire them.
While it is obvious that an annual plan gives your company extra cashflow upfront and takes churning out of the customer’s mind, it also means you’ll have less information about how effective your product is in providing enough value to your customers.
Monthly billing:
Annual billing:
What about having both? This is definitely something trending, which leads you to ask: “Ok, but which should I default to on page open?”.
All in all, what is important is that you are transparent in the price you are charging your customers. Take into consideration the cash flow an annual subscription can bring, and think how can you tackle the lack of feedback which usually derives from not having to put a product’s value to consideration every 30 days.
Don’t call the pricing page “The Pricing Page” on the pricing page.
The job of the headline is to translate emotion and the right tone to the user, once he lands into the pricing page. Keep it short (<7 words). No real information should go here, but whatever you write should relate to your business’s values.
Are short-term gains worth long-term failures?
Discount wars are what keeps retail companies afloat a lot of the time. Once one sale ends, another begins. So much so, that rarely does anybody have to pay full price for anything these days.
The reason retail discounting works so well for customer acquisition and the bottom line is that a department store or supermarket isn’t looking for a recurring purchase
SaaS businesses do.
A study by Price Intelligently found that SaaS discounting lowers long-term value (LTV) by 30 percent, as well as producing a higher churn rate and lower willingness to pay higher prices. All stats that add weight to the argument that discounting as SaaS isn’t a great idea.
Typically customers joining through heavy-discount initiatives have some common traits:
This basically translates into hammering your Unit Economics. Talk about lowering CAC for specific customers and you immediately have a longer time needed to recover CAC. If you lower CAC by 20%, each month you get 20% less on a monthly basis. If a normal core group takes 12 months to pay back the CAC, this means 3 months more. Right?
Nope. Let’s not forget these are customers which are much more prone to churn as they don’t put value over price.
As a result, you may lower your CAC by getting better signup velocity through the discount, but for a lot of these customers, you’ll never recover those costs anyway. This causes a scary implication for your cash flow (heavily influenced by your time to recover CAC), especially if you’re a cash strapped company on the funding train.
Contrary to popular opinion, the primary goal of a demo is not to demo your product! Let me say that again: the goal of the demo is not to demo your product. — Rob Gonzalez
Demos are therefore a chance for you to learn about your customer, their pain points and sell your product to them, taking the benefit-solution approach.
Ok, so I should always do it, right?
I would say it all ties in with the cost of opportunity.
Nevertheless, as mentioned in previous sections of this story, you should tie value to your pricing strategy, meaning that you should always consider having an “enterprise-style” black-box pricing option for larger customers. For these ones you can likely justify the cost of giving a demo, with the benefits you may reap.
So what is your goal when demonstrating SaaS? Like in copywriting and perhaps in all things marketing and sales, your goal in demonstrating is first to identify your prospect’s pain. From there, you further qualify if your product is a good fit to solve the pain.
Instead, the goals of the demo are:
There are some good reads on how to effectively demo your SaaS product. I’ll leave you with my favorite “How to demo your SaaS product”.
Generally, you should always think about your pricing tiers as a value-packed solution to users. It should never focus on having or not having this or that feature. This because feature-based pricing usually tends to not promote growth as it is not linked to a value-based metric.
My advice is to focus your different price tiers on the value you’re getting to the customer, the value-based metric, and add a link for the users to deep dive on what features each entails if they want.
Though you can have multiple feature differentiators per tier, it is the value metric that is critical for price differentiation across tiers. It is also critical for expansion revenue.
Will an extensive feature list cause someone to choose to buy the software? Probably not. Instead, continue the sales message: how specifically does this reduce the amount of X? Put that on the page; supplement with details about features where appropriate.
Having said that, no matter how you present the value of your product on your website, there comes a point where certain visitors just want to see a list of features.
This is especially valid for Enterprise customers and larger businesses who have a feature set in mind before they even land on your site. Listing out the features of your platform allows them to check all the boxes when evaluating your solution.
Adding the most common questions you got from past customers who were on their decision stage is good practice. Make sure to keep a record of your early stage customer interviews and constantly update it with new questions you get on your day to day customer support activity.
Decision making is a social exercise. This may seem counterintuitive for those that identify with independent rationality, but our brains are hardwired to seek cues and indicators from our environment. We look to the actions of other people as a way of evaluating the most appropriate behavior for ourselves. This is known as social proof and can be impactful on growing a successful startup.
Social proof on SaaS websites takes many forms:
Having a Social Proof section in your Pricing Page is usually beneficial in terms of giving that extra positive message to users who are considering your product. Especially if you are able to link it to a Case Study for instance.
So you’ve got all figured out and your pricing strategy came out with 3 solid pricing tiers which are intimately tied into the value your audience takes from the product at different stages of their own growth. Great stuff. You just have to place those 3 packages side by side and off you go.
Wait wait wait.
What if your product starts attracting big corporations, rather than just the Startup target audience you had first identified?
This means you’ll be charging the same to businesses in a different stage of their growth. A team of 20 in a big corporation sees things differently than a Startup with 10 individuals — there is more margin for you to expand your revenue with such businesses other than just the revenue you get from seat price.
That ‘s why it is important to have a black-boxed tier on your pricing plan. One which is not tied to upper hard or soft limits. Following the example above, you can limit your Startup Plan to 10 individuals and limit the bottom of your Enterprise plan to that, without capping it with upper limits.
I am personally against experimenting with prices in a CRO way, as it defeats the whole purpose of having a price strategy in the first place.
A/B testing page elements is something different. Here are a couple of things you can test within your price page:
Again, I don’t suggest playing around with A/B testing on your price points:
As you know, there is always more than one theory on a topic. Value-based pricing has been widely accepted in SaaS and several sources have shown proved value compared with cost or competitor based pricing strategies.
Florian Bauer, principal at the management consulting firm Vocatus, has a theory around behavior psychology that explains why is so important to take into consideration for pricing and how lessons from psychology can be applied to early-stage startups.
(…) For example, Behavioral Pricing has empirically proven that the notion of people having a predefined “willingness to pay” is wrong. Rather than having a willingness to pay, people tend to develop a price acceptance throughout their decision making process. This in turn implies that companies pricing strategies should not only react to a predefined and quantified willingness to pay but should focus on actively enlarging price acceptance. (…)
Price acceptance is not driven by value as is assumed in value-based pricing. This would imply that people only pay for the product features (as measured by conjoint analysis). In fact, people pay for much more than product features. Context and decision dynamics very much define price acceptance.
(…) there are five different types of behavioral decision making strategies: bargain hunting, risk aversion, price accepting, loyal and indifferent. We call them the GRIPS types. The different types react differently to the result of an independent price comparison. Understanding and predicting this, is the core of Behavioral Pricing.
As long as humans make decisions they will have predictable biases. This is probably even truer in B2B as in B2B decisions there are often more people involved.
Raising prices is often the ultimate challenge for anyone who cares about pricing. It’s often a taboo topic around the company. Your sales team won’t love it and you’re afraid to scare your customers away.
However, raising prices will also be something you’ll need to do, at a specific point in time, in order to achieve growth in the long term, as there’s only so much audience you can capture in any market.
Expanding your revenue should be something that comes naturally, and there are certain things you’ll need to take into consideration.
If you have to, only grandfather the first batch of customers that had to deal with all the code issues and downtime period.
When communicating a price increase, directly connect it to extra value to your customer, not to you
Give them the new added value for the same price they were paying for extra X months. Offer them to add more seats to that package at the old rate.
Churn will definitely exist. This doesn’t mean your customer will be pissed off at you, especially if you do the above when communicating. Simply they can’t afford the new market fit you’re looking into.
Some practical advice? Check How Close.io raised their prices
Pricing should be on top of mind of all SaaS founders and still, it seems that a Pricing Page usually at the bottom of the list of things to be created before launching.
Creating a Pricing strategy for your business should not be something done with a gut move. It should be a data-driven process involving your customers, with the goal of understanding the value they take from your product, determine their different growth stages and find a proper value metric to drive the evolution of how your product is priced.
Talking and acting on pricing should not be a taboo. In early-stage SaaS businesses, pricing should be frequently revisited and twice per year open to changes.
The growth of a SaaS business in the mid-long term depends on whether this business can increase its expanding revenues and generate negative churn. Expanding revenues can come in several forms but it is natural that in time, every SaaS business raises their prices.
Customers expect SaaS solutions to evolve with time, for new features to be added and for their value to increase. They should also be open to a fair price raise when one is clearly communicated.
Pricing changes should be seen as a step up and not as something to be put off — it’s a natural evolution for every SaaS business.

https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-i-earned-more-with-2-months-of-book-sales-than-18-months-of-saas-5c2b063b863b?source=search_post---------279,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
Starting in 2014 I began building what would become the first SaaS product I publicly released and attempted to make money. Through countless other failed apps and ideas, I finally landed on writing a book on how to build a SaaS application in Ruby on Rails in February which has already surpassed Stripe revenues earned from SaaS apps in 18 months.
In this article I am going to recount my experiences and go into painful details about:
What got me building SaaS products(and how to suck at it)As a software developer, most of us will have an itch to make our own thing. You know, that one thing you can call your own and don’t have to take direction from “the man”.
StandupTime started as an unnamed side project. I had planned on messing around with different front-end techniques and frameworks. Through discussions with friends and colleagues. I was told an online Daily Standup tool with real-time updates would be awesome! “That’s validation”, I thought. Boy, was I wrong, but more on that later.
I spent over ten months building, rebuilding and barely marketing a beta version of StandupTime. Without any following on Twitter, Medium or anything, I submitted StandupTime to a few beta sites. Over the summer of 2015, I ended up with one beta customer(this should have alarmed even the most naive maker, but I was oblivious).
Eventually, in September, I somehow orchestrated to show up on ProductHunt and LifeHacker on the same day(read about it here). I ended up after the week was up with about 500 new accounts created and a handful of those ready to pay!
Fast forwarding to the beginning of 2016 accounts have been churning and monthly revenue was dwindling. I decided to start talking to the users that were still around. It turns out that a Daily Standup app, no matter how well it functioned needed to fit better into their workflow.
A sane person would have made that happen. I’m not a sane person. I decided to rewrite the entire application and use a different stack that I have been professionally using for years: Ruby on Rails. I spent about six months rewriting the application, changing its branding(twice) and changing its approach to status(twice). The result was OverVue(spoiler alert: this app is End Of Life on March 30th, 2017).
This time, after getting a solid base of an application I set up to market better this time. I submitted to a few more beta sites this time around and promised I wouldn’t do much programming until I had some users ready to go. I thought I was hitting the mark with over 100 beta signups. WRONG AGAIN!
I’m sure there is a magic number of beta signups to a successful product launch. But I don’t know what that number is and I didn’t have enough users!
With another venture on its way out, it was on to the next one. This time I may have made the worst cardinal sin of bootstrapping. I decided to get zero feedback from any single person outside of my close circle of friends. I built an app in stealth.
I’m an idiot.
I built GetRoadmaps(with the general idea of StatusPage.io for public roadmaps) through the fall of 2016 completing the bulk of the application within in a few weeks. At this point, having built about 4 or 5 SaaS apps in total(some never released), it was getting pretty easy to get the standard part of the app completed.
After about four months of nights and weekends, I released GetRoadmaps without much fanfare. I awoke one morning in late December, on a sick day, of course, to find once again an app I created was on ProductHunt. This surprise only accounted for about ten signups.
See…I told you I am an idiot. Here are the revenue numbers to prove it:
While I had some small app ideas floating around I just didn’t have it in me to create yet another failed product. I noticed I had a general purpose path to quickly build SaaS apps in Ruby on Rails and liked helping people.
Should I…write?
I decided, what the hell. I have deployed a few apps through Elastic Beanstalk on AWS. Maybe I should write a quick tutorial about my experiences and see if it helps anyone. Well, it sure did. It gained a few thousand visits, posted in one of Ruby’s most viewed newsletters and got over 50 recommends. This response was the best response to anything I had written to date.
After talking with a friend who had recently gone through a code boot camp. He felt as though if he had built an actual product instead of a mock idea they would have gotten more real world experience.
Lightbulb. My experiences, a new passion, and a possible market converged. Build A SaaS App in Ruby on Rails 5 was born.
One problem…who exactly was going to buy this?
I decided to do what was working for me and to help others write better Rails applications through tutorials and technical posts. I would only link to my landing page and see what happens.
You may ask, “How is it working?”.
While it started off slow, by the current time I have a rolling 30 day total of about 23,000 mediums views. Roughly 3–5% of those visit the Build A SaaS App landing page. I’m a bad creator and didn’t have Google Analytics on my landing page from the start. So, piecing together information in Mixpanel it appears I have under 1000 total visits so far.
Once a user lands on the landing page(good name, eh?), about 7% of them take some action on the landing page. The activities tracked are “Requesting a Sample Chapter” or “Clicking the presale” button.
Still, you persist, “Seriously, how is it working?”
It’s going well! So far, in short of two calendar months from the landing page going live with no following. I have amassed 50 presale customers who believe in a product I am creating.
I started noticing writing would flow easier. I felt connected to the articles I was writing on Medium. The chapters in the book were flying out of my brain. Excited for each chance I had to write another paragraph that could help another person in this world. I was no longer worrying about how to generate revenue or market myself.
Plus, the feedback has been great! Most are often scared to share their writing or creations even though I may not be the most prolific Ruby on Rails developer. I have not received anything worse than a mild criticism of a particular approach or a suggestion to fix a typo here and there.
In fact, the majority of the feedback has been praise and thanks. This kind of feedback is the stuff that keeps people going. I would say when you find passion the revenue will come.
The most important thing I can share is not to give up. Not only is it tough to create and share, but it may take the time to find your passion.
Another tip would be to write. Write for yourself. Write to help others. Write to remember that one weird trick to get that stubborn error to go away.
I hope this can motivate you to find and/or do something you feel passionate about.

https://medium.com/point-nine-news/mobile-saas-ftw-c4115d37e880?source=search_post---------356,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
It’s been over two years that Christoph first wrote about our interest in mobile SaaS and the number of mobile apps from the Point Nine Portfolio has since increased quite notably:
In fact, out of all 27 SaaS investments we did with Fund II, 25% of the companies are mobile-first and another 40% offer at least some of their functionality on native mobile apps. Plus the remaining batch includes companies like Contentful, Algolia, Typeform and Remerge that are riding on the wave of mobile adoption. So yea, it is becoming a real thing in SaaS.
The first waves of SaaS tools like Salesforce and Zendesk were essentially replacing big incumbents that were offering expensive, customised on-premise software to BIG enterprise clients. Through digital distribution these SaaS pioneers opened up the rest of the market by making it more accessible, affordable and easier to use.
Mobile is changing this again. The fact that everybody now carries a small computer in their pockets expands the opportunity for SaaS companies into markets that traditionally might not have relied on computers — or have done so to a much lesser extent. Kevin Spain of Emergence Capital has coined these solutions ‘Deskless Enterprise Apps’ in this excellent presentation and it’s an area we are very excited about.
To give you some concrete examples, we have for instance invested in mobile SaaS tools for field services (Jobber), field sales (Handshake), classrooms (Showbie), real estate agents (Happy Inspector) and merchandisers (TBA). All of them have one thing in common: The end-users of these solutions were not in front of a computer five years ago.
I think there is still a lot of opportunity across most industries: Construction is heating up, health care is still wide open and there are interesting things happening in agriculture (among many other verticals).
These mobile opportunities also come with their own difficulties though: More education might be necessary, ARPAs might be lower & churn higher (at first) and it might be harder to figure out the right distribution channels. Yet I am very confident that time will play in our favour and a lot of big mobile-first companies will be built in the coming years.
To leave you with some practical take-aways, here a few things we have learned along the way.
App stores are not a great distribution channel
In contrast to mobile consumer apps, where an Apple / Google feature can make you, this will most likely not apply to you. Even if you end up reaching the right user (which is hard, as the App Store is so untargeted), it is most likely not the person that would be paying for the solution. So in most cases you are better off focusing on traditional SaaS distribution channels like content marketing or inside sales.
No mobile app can kill a deal
In some cases, not having a mobile application as a companion to your desktop app can break a deal. Especially in competitive spaces and big budgets, a mobile application can be part of a checklist that is hard to argue away. If your buyers require a mobile app, you are probably well off investing in a mobile MVP early on, especially if you have long sales cycles.
Start simple when moving from web
That being said, if you are moving from web to mobile, don’t try to cram all of your functionality into the app. Start with the core use case (or atomic user journey) and then add functionality as you learn more about what your customers need on mobile. If you have the resources, it might make sense to put a dedicated team on this, as it helps to come up with a fresh view.
You want to be on at least two platforms (duh)
Some companies might use iOS devices, others Android. Some might even use Windows tablets (theoretically) and others a mix of all of them. It’s rather obvious that you should be on the two biggest platforms as you will otherwise experience a heavy scattering loss in your marketing activities, especially when you start spending real money to scale.
Know your users
Mobile SaaS plays can be different from traditional SaaS tools as the managers, buyers or administers that you sell to often use a different part of the software (the web version) than the end users themselves (the mobile app). This can lead to an information asymmetrie in which you are building around the requirements of the desktop users and neglect the actual (usually higher number of) end users. Keep that in mind when building your roadmap and try to stay in touch with all of your users, for instance by using NPS or feedback surveys on all usage levels.
To BYOD or not to BYOD
It is also relevant to understand on which devices your application is used. If it is a BYOD environment, you might want to factor that in when you think about what features to leverage. You probably want to avoid spamming users with push notifications in their downtime for instance and be careful not to provoke counter-productive behaviours.
Mobile SaaS FTW!

https://saasholic.com/criando-um-time-de-vendas-para-o-seu-saas-59f5bfb1aa18?source=search_post---------338,"Eu lembro da minha primeira experiência com venda de uma plataforma online, eu tinha 32 anos, parece que foi esse ano. Ops! Foi esse ano!
Embora já tenha alguns anos de experiência no empreendedorismo e 18 anos de experiência com desenvolvimento e criação de produtos digitais, é a primeira vez que tive que aprender a vender, para que minha empresa possa chegar onde eu e meus sócios queremos. O mais engraçado é que já tive outras empresas antes, mas em uma delas (empresa de desenvolvimento) era side project e tínhamos a sorte de poder escolher os clientes que iríamos trabalhar, e no segundo projeto (empresa de treinamento de desenvolvimento), tínhamos uma lista de espera de mais de 1000 alunos e as turmas, na maioria dos casos, demoravam poucas horas para lotar, ou seja, não precisávamos vender.
Hoje na Bunee.io, eu tenho a necessidade de aprender a vender, a escalar nossas vendas, a trabalhar não só o inbound com muito carinho, como aprimorar o nosso processo de outbound sales, e montar pela primeira vez uma equipe de sales. Nesse post, contarei um pouco do que aprendi para criar esse time de vendas em uma Startup SaaS remota e em fase inicial.
Ok, temos um problema: Precisamos estudar sobre algo que não conhecemos e precisamos aprender a estruturar nosso time de sales. Sendo assim, nosso processo de aprendizado passou por 4 passos:
É bem gostoso ver que você conseguiu converter 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 clientes com algo que você acredita e sabe que vai ajudar pessoas/empresas a recrutarem programadores. Porém, os sócios de uma startup em fase inicial tem diversos chapéus, o que dificulta bastante a disciplina necessária em um processo de sales. Quando você precisa se preocupar com planejamento estratégico, relacionamento com investidores, definição e produção do roadmap do produto, criação de conteúdo, alinhamento com os colaboradores, entre muitas outras atividades, acaba não entregando com qualidade o serviço que é o coração da sua empresa.
Por isso, chegamos a seguinte decisão, contratar 2 profissionais de sales para a Bunee.io. Fizemos todo o levantamento financeiro para saber se conseguiríamos rodar esse planejamento com qualidade, e fizemos a famosa mágica financeira que um dono ou dona de Startup tem que fazer (admiro muito vocês). Assim, conseguimos iniciar essa operação!
No processo rápido de aprendizado para criarmos uma vaga coerente, copiamos (sim, na cara dura, sem medo de ser feliz, ah vai dizer que você nunca fez isso?) a maioria dos job descriptions de sales que eu achei, foram 5 abas abertas, principalmente para saber como descrever as responsabilidades de um profissional dessa altura.
O mais importante nesse momento é o seu planejamento, pois o recomendado é abrir 2 ou mais vagas de sales de uma vez. Em todas as leituras, a recomendação é NÃO CONTRATAR APENAS 1 PESSOA DE VENDAS! A competição saudável entre os vendedores é super positiva para eles e para a empresa.
Uma dica antes de mostrar como ficou o nosso job description, cuidado na hora de copiar, pois muitas vagas de Sales são vinculadas a Sales Development Representative (SDR), cuja responsabilidade é diferente de um Closer ou um time pequeno, que ainda precisará definir esses papéis e testar as responsabilidades.
– Contatar os potenciais clientes por telefone e email– Acompanhar os clientes no processo de venda e realizar follow-up– Mapear e compreender o processo de tomada de decisão dos clientes.– Explorar diferentes estratégias comerciais para maximizar a conversão– Criar e negociar propostas comerciais– Realizar fechamento e processos de contrato– Desenvolver relatórios semanais e mensais para a gerência– Responsável no estabelecimento da previsão de vendas e plano de longo prazo para cada um dos clientes da carteira
E juntamos como desejáveis, um pouco de DNA com possíveis tarefas que agregarão valor para nossa empresa.
– Aprendizado rápido– Experimentar e testar templates de cold-email– Usar um sistema de gerenciamento de Leads para vendas– Negociar com clientes e saber lidar com descontos– Pensar em conteúdos que possam gerar novos leads para o funil– Ter a habilidade de ver oportunidades além do alcance em seu funil de vendas– Orientação a resultados;– Ter seu próprio computador com bom acesso a internet
Assim, restou apenas dizer quem somos e o que podemos oferecer em troca, para termos os dois lados felizes na história:
– Salário a combinar (contrato PJ) + comissão individual + comissão time– Trabalhar em uma cultura que valoriza as pessoas e entrega de resultados;– Autonomia e flexibilidade;– Trabalho remoto (poder morar onde quiser, se for de BH melhor ainda :P);– Dedicação de apenas 6 horas por dia;– Muitos desafios e aprendizados;– Oportunidade de eventos e cursos que deixem você mais próximo dos melhores do mercado;
A partir daí, nossa vaga foi aberta, criamos uma página no nosso blog em wordpress para divulgar a vaga e um template no typeform para receber as aplicações, e em poucos dias já tínhamos uma boa quantidade de aplicações para trabalhar.
Para analisar o perfil dos candidatos, fizemos apenas 8 perguntas no formulário de aplicação:
O critério inicial era o salário, não como fator de preferência, mas como fator de eliminação. Deixe-me explicar, lembra quando eu falei que fizemos um planejamento para saber se conseguiríamos contratar uma equipe de sales? Pois é, nesse planejamento, já conseguimos definir qual o nosso teto, criando uma régua bem definida sobre quais talentos eu não poderia contratar em meu time, não por cultura ou habilidade, mas por cargo/salário.
Vale lembrar, que eu não acredito em negociação salarial. Creio que uma contratação realizada após uma negociação salarial sempre termina com um dos lados achando que fez um mal negócio. Por isso, todos os candidatos, cuja pretensão salarial fugiam bastante do nosso teto, receberam um email nosso, agradecendo bastante pelo tempo e informando que o motivo da não continuidade era por não podermos contratar alguém como ele, e desejando muita sorte na caminhada.
Todos que possuíam o critério salarial + experiência média maior que 3, nós chamamos para uma entrevista comigo por skype.
E agora? Precisava entrevistar uma pessoa de sales, sem ser de vendas :O
Em minha carreira de produtos digitais em grandes empresas como Jornal Do Brasil e Petrobras, ganhei bastante experiência em levantamento da persona dos candidatos, entrevistas, mapeamento de personalidade e até mesmo criação de testes e desafios técnicos, afinal, eu tenho uma empresa de recrutamento né?
Mas, seria pura arrogância acreditar que meu conhecimento se aplica para uma vaga de comercial, uma escolha mal feita poderia gerar uma insatisfação nossa, ou pior, de uma pessoa recém contratada por nós. Por isso, voltei a estudar e encontrei um dos guias mais legais para estruturação de uma equipe de vendas.
Dica: Tatue esse site abaixo no seu braço, pois você usará em diversos momentos do setor de vendas da sua startup, desde o founder vendedor até um time de mais de 25 profissionais de sales.
O nosso processo foi muito parecido com o sugerido pelo site do close.io, que por sinal, tem um canal super legal no youtube (fica a dica!). Onde montei o seguinte roteiro de entrevista para os candidatos:
No fim, contei sobre a nossa proposta salarial, que vinha com um valor fixo + comissão por venda + meta se vender X planos por mês + SUPER meta se vender Y planos por mês. Para eu criar esse plano de comissão, contei com uma ajuda de um grande amigo (Obrigado Gui!) que é super experiente no setor de Sales, não só vendendo, como desenvolvendo e estruturando vendas em empresas de tecnologia.
Para facilitar a decisão junto com os sócios, anotei as respostas e pontuei com um score, assim entreguei o report de todas as entrevistas no slack para os sócios e nos juntamos para avançarmos na contratação. Em junho começamos com o nosso SUPER time, e esperamos continuar estudando, aprendendo e é claro, vendendo!
Espero que essa timeline de vendas possa ajudá-los em seus processos. qualquer ajuda ou feedback, dê um alô no meu twitter Bernard De Luna

https://blog.redash.io/sql-query-to-calculate-saas-metrics-dd25d72a0521?source=search_post---------363,"It will probably not surprise you that we’re using Redash to track our business metrics. As those are pretty much standard for all SaaS businesses, I thought it will be useful to share the query we use to calculate these metrics.
The query we share here was written for PostgreSQL, but as any SQL, can be repurposed for any database. You will just need to replace some functions and maybe the use of CTEs (WITH).
The entire query is a bit long, so let’s break it down to smaller steps:
Step 1: normalize the incoming data
What’s going on here? We use PostgreSQL’s CTE feature (WITH) to create a simple to use “view” local to the query, this allows us to normalize the incoming data.
We basically need:
Step 2: calculate MRR, accounts per month and ARPU
OK, this is very easy: we aggregate the data by month to get the total number of accounts and resulting MRR in a month. Then we use the same numbers to calculate the ARPU.
Step 3: calculate MRR changes
Now things become a bit more tricky: we take the v_charges view we defined, and LEFT JOIN it with itself. We do this join to get the previous month’s (if available) charge for this account.
Step 4: Calculate Churn
Again we query from v_charges but we join both with the next month’s charge and the v_mrr view we defined to get the total MRR of the month.
Step 5: Calculate Total per Month
Now we simply sum the values of new/contraction/expansion MRR from v_mrr_changes to get the total value per month.
Step 6: Join Everything and Calculate Net New MRR
The last step is to simply join all the different metrics from v_totals, v_mrr_churn and v_mrr and calculate the Net New MRR.
Done. 🙌
Note that we filter the last month data, because it won’t be accurate: any account not charged yet will be considered as churned. We can fix this by adding any account that wasn’t cancelled but not charged yet to the list of charges.
You can find the full query in this Gist.
Now that we have the data, we can produce some useful visualizations with it. Some examples we use:
MRR Change Over Time
Total MRR & Accounts Count
These two are just an example, there are many others you can produce like MRR growth over time, churn over time, compare MRR churn vs. accounts churn and more.
We’re happy to share this query, and hope you will find it useful (feel free to click on the 👏 button to show your love). If you created some elaborate SQL queries (with Redash or not, but you really should use Redash), we are welcoming you to share them. Either in our forum, or as a guest blog post here.

https://rocketshipgrowth.com/the-most-scalable-channel-for-large-highly-qualified-saas-leads-hint-its-not-facebook-4c6fe110a6e7?source=search_post---------226,"When I speak with SaaS companies about paid ads strategy they are usually experiencing at least one of these three problems:
1) There is a low-level of market awareness about what they do… people are not actively searching for what they do. In Eugene Schwartz’s “Five Levels of Market Awareness” most of their prospects are at the “Problem-aware” stage.
SaaS companies who sell to large enterprise customers are often at this stage and experience this problem.
SaaS companies who use a software and service hybrid business model to add extra value to their customers with the power of tech + a done-for-you service often also operate at this “Problem-aware” stage. People will also often confuse what they do with just being a pure-play SaaS.
Successful SaaS companies I’ve talked to like Bounce Exchange, Price Intelligently, PressCable and LeadChat all fall into this category.
2) Leads that are generated from paid ads are often low quality. This is due to the leads not meeting very unique “ideal client profile” criteria that each of these companies need to have met before they will take on a client.
3) Leads are often too small. Only companies above a certain revenue level will get the most amount of value from their SaaS (or service/software package) due to the higher price point compared to an SMB SaaS product.
In this article I’m going to demonstrate how I would use 2 paid media channel strategies to drive highly qualified, enterprise leads into the top of SaaS companies sales funnels and convert them into demos.
Most successful SaaS companies often already work with a small number of enterprise-level companies, so the goal of these strategies will be to:
For this article I’m going to use LeadChat as an example.
LeadChat are an Australian company that sell outsourced live chat in Australia and USA. They already work with big Australian enterprise companies like Health.com.au, Seek, Mazda and Jim’s Franchises.
They have a great value proposition: real humans that work 24/7 to answer your live chats and capture 4x-8x more leads from your website (while being 50x cheaper than hiring a full-time employee).
Their ideal client is any business who has 1,000+ unique monthly website visitors, with no target customer in any specific market vertical.
Here are the channels I would use to generate leads for their business.
For a lot of enterprise SaaS and software/service hybrid companies Google AdWords paid search won’t work, however there is a very small segment of the market that are “Solution-aware” and are actively searching for the solution LeadChat offer.
Here are average monthly search volumes on Google in Australia.
As you can see, there is not a lot of search volume on Google for people searching for high buy intent keywords that relate to “outsourced live chat”.
However there is enough for a small campaign.
If I was LeadChat and I only had a small $2-3k/mo media budget, I would start by running a small AdWords paid search campaign to a landing page that offers a demo of their software/service using some of these keywords.
That would be a great start to bring in a small amount of high quality leads.
But due to limited search volume on AdWords, their monthly lead generation volume would eventually max out on this channel. So to really scale their lead generation I would need to find a more scalable channel.
PS - If your SaaS is in a well-established market targeting SMBs with something like “accounting software” or “plumbing software” you can use AdWords paid search to scale your lead generation.
Google Display Network gives you access to 90% of worldwide Internet users, through more than 2 million publishers.
It is where the top 1% of media buyers play.
It’s a place where driving 100,000 clicks per day is no problem.
While FB ad budgets will often max out at $10k/day, GDN ad budgets will scale up to $100k/day.
To target LeadChat’s ideal client profile, I would identify 5 unique characteristics of their ideal client profile before ever running the ads:
To target their enterprise persona, I would identify the enterprise software, enterprise blogs, enterprise competitors, etc.
I would then create a Custom Affinity Audience for each one (ie: 5 audiences Google will create that is themed around those 5 ideal client profile characteristics) to target ads to.
Here is how it would look once it is setup:
The big challenge with GDN ads is that someone seeing a display ad isn’t necessarily interested in your product just yet, so you need to offer content that you think will be valuable and helpful to your prospects to build trust.
To overcome this challenge I would use the TOFU-MOFU-BOFU model.
TOFU = Acquire market specific leadsMOFU = Filter leads for topic interestBOFU = Qualify leads as prospects
Here is a simple overview of how this would look:
For LeadChat, keeping in mind that their ideal client is any business with 1,000+ website visitors, this is what I would use for their TOFU, MOFU and BOFU.
TOFU (Top-Of-The-Funnel): Top 50 Website Traffic Sources [Spreadsheet]
A good TOFU offer should be something simple and light with utility that everyone in your market would love to have. For LeadChat, that could be a spreadsheet of traffic sources. Veterans and newbies alike will love it.
The purpose of the TOFU is not to filter or qualify. It’s sole purpose is acquisition. It should convert as high as possible and attract as many people as possible. For LeadChat that would be anyone with a website.
MOFU (Middle-Of-The-Funnel): How Jim’s Franchisees Generate 5x More Website Leads With 24/7 Live Chat [Webinar]
The MOFU and BOFU do the filtering and qualifying.
Webinars are great MOFU offers. People who attend LeadChat’s webinar will not just be any business with a website. They will be businesses with websites wanting to use live chat to generate more leads.
From the TOFU email series LeadChat may need to sell some of them on 24/7 live chat. Businesses use all sorts of website lead generation tactics. LeadChat need to explain why 24/7 live chat is cheaper and the most efficient method to monetise website traffic into leads.
BOFU (Bottom-Of-The-Funnel): Online Demo + $99 Calibration [Demo]
From the webinar you DO NOT pitch your SaaS. They are not ready yet.
There is a sequence you must follow.
Instead, just deliver great content. For LeadChat, they really need to show why 24/7 live chat is the best or only option people should use.
Then at the end push them to a demo.
To qualify leads LeadChat could have a “unique monthly website visitors” field people need to fill out when requesting the demo (eg: <1k, 1k-10k, 10k-100k, 100k+), so they only speak with qualified leads.
Now you’ve taken people from MOFU to BOFU. These are leads who want to see how YOU do it.
From there LeadChat can go through the infallible process they use to convert website visitors into leads with live chat and ask if people would like to invest in a $99 Calibration (ie: a 2 week trial period where LiveChat agent managers go on their website, measure the results and provide a tailored solution if successful).
There are paid media channels where you can drive people straight to a demo or trial of your software (eg: Google AdWords paid search, YouTube paid search, Bing paid search, etc).
This always works best with intent-based paid media channels (ie: channels where people are searching for what you do).
For contextual-based paid media channels (eg: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Google Display Network) you need to take a more strategic approach to acquire, filter and qualify leads.
You can try sending people straight to your BOFU offer (eg: software demo) and you might get lucky 3/100. Or you might end up with a whole bunch of unqualified (small, low quality) leads and all your ad spend wasted.
If you’re like most SaaS companies, you will send all of your leads to your trial/demo page as fast as you can. Like a 13 year old boy with his first girl, rushing to try and get to 3rd base before he’s even gotten on 1st.
And what you will end up with is a bunch of leads that are not yet ready for your offer aka low conversions.
If you want your sales team speaking with highly qualified leads from your paid ads, try the TOFU-MOFU-BOFU model.
Hubspot attracts 60,000+ new leads per month using this lead generation model to sell their enterprise SaaS product.
If you can make it work, you too can have a SaaS customer acquisition system to acquire, filter and qualify leads at scale.
For LeadChat, this would mean:

https://medium.com/swlh/startup-marketing-lessons-e06135e62254?source=search_post---------5,"There are currently no responses for this story.
Be the first to respond.
I recently finished a three-year experience of doing marketing for a venture-funded startup in the social media analytics industry.
It’s a hyper-competitive world where only the top player (or maybe if lucky the top 2 or 3) get all the value. You must grow fast or die a slow death. The pressure is on to get people excited to talk about your product, visit your site and convert into a paying customer.
The major problem most startups face is marketing and the ability to carve out a niche, find and retain paying customers. Even with a stellar developer team and a stellar product, your startup may not grow or survive without a great marketing and sales teams.
I hope this post and my startup marketing lessons can help you in your journey. Let’s get started.
You should start promoting yourself and building your audience before you have a finished product or even before you have a great idea that you want to build. Don’t wait to start building your audience after you’ve launched a product.
Most first-time developers actually ignore marketing. They’re oblivious to the challenge of attracting people to take a look at something they’ve created. At least until they see their first project crash and burn within hours of the launch.
There are so many times that I have seen developers spend countless hours building something, releasing it with no fanfare and only then trying to figure out how to promote it by asking marketing questions on Indie Hackers or Hacker News. Don’t make that mistake.
Create a website on your domain name and start publishing great content about things that you know (or even things you’re working on or trying to learn about). Content will help get you discovered and build your authority and influence.
Don’t fall into the idealistic developer trap of wanting to build this from scratch. Use something like WordPress and with a plugin or two you can get a great website, blog or even a MVP done in a day or two rather than spend a month or two building it from scratch. This time is better spent on building an audience and talking to actual people you are trying to serve.
Here’s why content is your best marketing bet:
These efforts mean that you will have someone to shout to when you have a finished product you want everyone to know about. Your first customers will find you through your content.
Building an audience can even help you figure out what product to create and get great feedback as you take your followers on your founder journey.
You want a reliable way of reaching out to the audience that you are building. This way you can tell them when there’s something big such as you being ready to open the doors for customers.
Social media is definitely not a very reliable communication channel. Due to the different algorithms in place, you rarely get more than 10% of your total audience to see any message that you post on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and others.
Email marketing is different. It’s a very low tech and flexible medium. It’s very personal and gets higher reach than social media. You completely own your mailing list too so you can choose between the different email providers or even self-host it. MailChimp is a great starting point for building your database and running your mailing list.
Start growing that mailing list straight away. And keep growing it even after you have a finished product.
Most people who discover your startup are not ready to buy straight away. They need time and may need your product only in the future. Each new email address that you add to your mailing list is a new lead and a new prospect for you or for your sales team.
You have many different tools (and WordPress plugins) that allow you to insert various calls to action on your content asking people to sign up to hear from you. Again, this is not something you want to spend time building yourself from scratch.
This is also something you can experiment a lot with trying to find the best copy, the best offer and the best location for your call to action.
I’m against those up front and invasive pop-up ads that take over the majority of the screen as soon as you enter a site.
On the other hand, I’m happy to experiment with messages that show up depending on how long a user has been on site, how deep the visitor has scrolled down the page or even showing a message on exit intent and see what results they bring.
Get used to being ignored. You have put a lot of time and effort into something be it a product or a blog post. You release it into the wild but get no feedback whatsoever.
No email replies, no comments, no responses or signups. You might see a few likes here and there only. Or a comment from your mom.
The web and social media are full of lurkers. Internet is a great place for people to join a community and passively observe. There’s no obligation to respond or interact. 90% of users are lurkers who never contribute, 9% contribute a little, and 1% account for almost all the action.
You almost certainly have more people paying attention to you than what you see in your engagement numbers so do beware of that and keep pushing your project.
It’s so difficult to get any attention these days. There’s just so much content and everyone has so many options for what they want to spend their time on.
It’s best that you take some time and think about your content strategy before you start producing the actual content.
It helps that you think like the audience you’re trying to reach, that you’ve had a similar experience, been in a similar position and that you can be in their shoes. Think about your target audience:
This will not only help you get tons of ideas for content to create, but it will also help you create more targeted and more effective content that will result in more benefits to you and your business.
You really need to work hard on figuring out what can make you stand out in the crowded world. What makes you different from the other sites in your industry. The common angle of looking at a topic is no longer of any real interest. You should add an angle on an angle.
This can take a long time and may need a lot of testing and experimentation.
Here are some more ideas on content you can start:
The goal of your content marketing is to drive brand awareness and business growth. This means not just publishing content and driving traffic, but also converting blog visitors into subscribers, leads and paying customers.
This is not necessarily the same as driving viral traffic. Fewer but more targeted visitors is much better than masses of irrelevant people who will visit and bounce back within a few seconds. Keep that in mind. It’s quality over quantity.
Don’t forget to also target the newly acquired customers by helping them maximize the value they get from your product. When acquisition is so hard it’s important to limit the churn and retain your customers as long as possible.
You cannot just publish content and expect people to find you. It doesn’t work like that. You need to have a marketing strategy ready for things to do after you publish a new piece of content in order to drive awareness and traffic to it.
And this doesn’t mean just sending a tweet from your Twitter profile. The organic opportunities on established social platforms pretty much don’t exist. Ignore them. Do this instead:
Syndicating your content to larger, established sites with broader reader bases works in your favor in several ways. You get your message in front of a large audience that is interested in what you’re doing.
This will lead to an increase in brand awareness and your authority. It might give you some clicks and visits to your site, some subscribers to your mailing list or some followers on your social media.
The biggest long-term benefit of getting mentioned on a bigger site is that you’re building the authority and links to your domain name.
This will result in your content ranking higher for a wider range of long tail keywords which will introduce you to new people some of which will decide to join your mailing list too.
Here are places where I promote my content. These can be considered as low hanging fruit and are a great place to start in your outreach efforts.
Here’s a good Medium leaderboard if you’re looking for an easy way to find even more publications.
Journalists, bloggers and other influencers already have built their audiences and have access to platforms that can extend the reach of your messages too.
If you can reach out to them with interesting messages and build relationships with them your message may be shared further. This is also where your great content can help you get attention.
Reach out to journalists that are writing relevant stories using tools such as Haro and SourceBottle.
Getting large industry sites such as Adweek and Social Media Examiner to mention and link to your startup feels very good.
This is it. Pretty much everything you need to know about how to create a great marketing strategy for your startup. Make it a great lead generator for your business thanks to all the marketing activities that you put in place.
Now it’s the time for the hard part. Doing the actual work and seeing tiny progress day after day. Good luck!

💎 This morning I discovered an old gem hidden away in my Dropbox. 💎
The gem is an interview I did of Gail Goodman at the Momentum Summit here at MIT in Cambridge back in 2010.
If you don’t know Gail or Constant Contact, Constant Contact was founded during the “boom days” of the early internet, survived the post-bubble apocalypse, and eventually became a publicly traded company and market leader.
I think we can all still learn a lot from Gail’s lessons so I wanted to share them here today.
Here are 8 startup lessons that I learned from Gail:

I made a Mandarin learning iOS app, and after four months I sold it on Flippa for $3000. Want to know how I did this and what could be done better? Be my guest. Oh, and if it’s not a good time for a story, I prepared takeaway points at the end of the article.
After visiting Beijing and Shanghai, last year I fell in love with Mandarin Chinese and decided to make my own app for memorizing Chinese characters, since most apps in that niche were not good enough. It turned out that I wasn’t the only one who enjoyed it, so I started to offer, quite successfully, some in-app products in it. I’m going to tell this story in future articles, so for now let’s focus on its selling process.
When I decided to sell it (I had too much on my plate at the moment), it was a tough decision because somehow I felt attached to this app, which is quite unusual for me.
Anyway, the most obvious selling platform was Flippa. Since I hadn’t much time (I had an urgent flight from Chiangmai to Hong Kong at 6 am) I decided not to read any tutorials and just use my standard transparent and honest approach.
I wrote a story describing the reasons I made this app, what the buyer will get, and uploaded a bunch of screenshots with various stats.
After that, I set the time of the auction for two weeks, hit the “Publish” button, and started to prepare for the flight.
Instinctively, I set the reserve price high enough to not regret if the app would be sold while I’m not online. Also I hadn’t set any Buy-It-Now price.
While I was away, people started to put bids on my listing.
At first, when I looked at the bid values I was like “Really?” But soon I figured it out that the Most Active ranking in Flippa solely depends on the amount of bids your listing received.
So actually those tiny bids were a good thing.
As the listing collected bids it climbed higher and higher in the Most Active ranking until eventually on the 7th day of the auction it had hit the first position and stayed there until the end.
When my listing made itself home at the first place in the ranking I started to get more and more feedback.
At this point, I had already read the Flippa manual and realized that with every comment, the watchers (subscribers) of the listing got an email notification. So besides answering the questions from prospective buyers, I posted something useful in the comments from time to time.
The rule of thumb here is to post the answers to the questions you’ve been asked in your private messages.
Do not exaggerate, and do not lie here. It will come back to bite you. Karma works like a charm. As well as Flippa’s dispute settling team.
There are very few things on this planet more boring than an auction in the middle of its term. So let’s fast forward to the final hours.
As the listing was approaching its closing, I got more and more direct offers from the top buyers.
Some of them stated that the price they had offered was “the very last” price. But more often than not, just before I had any opportunity to answer them, some other buyer made a public bid that exceeded the direct price.
The flow was quite rapid:
But after the price hit $2550 the race had stumbled. I believe it was because the top bidders decided to slow down a bit and do not escalate the competition beyond a reasonable price.
At the same time, I’d gotten two direct messages from them. One was stating that this is the last bid they’d put and another one was just offering $3000 for the whole package.
Now this is where I made a huge mistake.
I made both of them a counter-offer, proposing the price of $3500, and of course it had been rejected. I never should have done this. It would have been much better if prior to making any offers, I set a $3500 Buy-It-Now price to put more pressure on them.
Why am I so sure about that? Because when I agreed on the $3000 offer of one bidder and set the BIN price at this amount I instantly got two closing!
Both of them were from the bidders I made the offers to. As one of them told me later, he would have paid at least $3200 if I were more assertive.
I perfectly knew from the countless books about negotiations I read that I should make offers only after putting pressure on the opponent. But as always with this sort of thing, reading about sex and actually having it are two different things.
Anyway, I’m happy about this case. It’s not exactly a one-billion-dollar story, but the best thing about it is that it can be repeated by any of you. Just remember or bookmark these simple points.
Every selling is different, but there are some general rules that your listing should match in order to maximize the views, the bids, and the result price:
Have you ever sold any project? What would you like to sell?
By the way, I’m going to write an article about the app in question where I reveal how I created it, how much it earned, and other juicy stuff. Make sure to follow me on my Twitter or Medium to not to miss it. Thanks!

I committed to explaining openly why I have invested in a company. The intent is to build transparency about our Connect thesis and to clarify what we look for, how we pick deals and in general how we think about things. We believe that this will be of use for the founders who will look at Connect as their potential Seed investor.
My first post was “Why we invested in EduMe”. Most readers appreciated the explanation about our investment thesis and why it is the fabric of the whole Connect strategy. Some of the feedback I received from that post was to provide more context and storytelling about our overall SaaS investment strategy.So here it is.
I love SaaS
With my first company Neo Network — a mobile messaging startup I co-founded back in 2001— it took me over eight years to ramp up to $25m in annual revenues. Furthermore, most of those revenues were services-based, had long sale cycle and low margins, and above all, were non-predictable. At the opening of every year, we rebooted the revenue-o-meter and started from scratch. It was so damn hard. Like in surfing, when you need to paddle out every time to take the next wave. But, unlike surfing, it wasn’t cool.
So it’s not a surprise that once I turned investor, SaaS was love at first sight. Since co-founding Connect in 2012, I’ve had the privilege to back some great SaaS companies. I have been learning a shit load whilst serving great product founders and working next to some of the best European SaaS investors: Neil Rimer / Index Ventures, Christoph Janz / Point Nine Capital, Itzik Parnafes / Battery Ventures, Evgenia Plotnikova / Dawn Capital, Thibaud Elziere / eFounders, Jean de La Rochebrochard / Kima Ventures.
The SaaS market is an ocean with thousands of amazing startups sailing off every year. To navigate through it I needed a compass. The compass that worked for me has been our core investment thesis combined and intersected with specific points of view: strategic frameworks and themes we are passionate about. Three examples we have applied to date:
1) The power of exceptional design and user experienceFirst and foremost, our credo is in the power of superior design and world-class user experience to drive bottom-up customer adoption. We religiously believe in the so-called Consumerization of B2B Software. That is, business software doesn’t have to suck anymore and a user-centric approach is the trademark of the SaaS industry. This point of view led to our investments in Typeform, Marvel, Infogram and Charlie.
2) The rise of API-based SaaS  Secondly, our conviction in the exceptional benefits of building and consuming API-based products drove our investments in TrueLayer (Banking API), Forest (Admin interface API), Moltin (e-Commerce API) and TimeKit (scheduling API).
3) “Future of Work” This is a theme we are very passionate at Connect. In particular, we have formed our point of view about two related issues. One revolves around the impact of Artificial Intelligence. We believe in the adoption of machine learning in SaaS product for augmenting human capabilities via automation and personalization, rather than for the full replacement of human intelligence. This thesis has guided our investments in companies such as Kheiron, GenieAI and Stepsize, where machine learning algorithms work alongside humans professionals (i.e. radiologists, lawyers and developers) to augment their abilities and performances. We will dig into these investments in future blog posts.
The second issue is around the profound change in the structure of work. There is a progressive shift towards new distributed and decentralised work models.
We believe that this transformation represents a formidable opportunity for the creation of a new layer of innovative products that, leveraging software, can empower these new work models. With tremendous benefits for both the employers and the workers.
I am thrilled to back the founders leading this revolution and creating new categories in work-tech.
This thesis has guided our investments in Side (on-demand platform for temporary jobs), Soldo (smart payment cards for the field workforce and the self-employed), EduMe (micro-training mobile for the frontline workforce), Accountable (Tax and accounting automation for freelancers) and more recently an HRIS platform to fix for good one of the bigger blocker of distributed work: international hiring and payroll.
We continuously re-assess formed point of views and add more. Two more frameworks I look for are:
The future of Business solutions to me. A sort of T-shaped products combining a horizontal software tool superpowered with a vertical something: a professional service, a marketplace, a financial product. Come for the something, stay for the tool. Or viceversa. Great examples in our portoflio of Super SaaS are
I am very bullish about this combo to create tremendous value for every business, from small to large enterprise.
Products using technology innovation like Machine Learning or regulatory macro shifts like Open Banking to rethink entire workflow and industry practices (Migacore, LifeBit, TrueLayer).
If you are a founder building a SaaS (or a Super SaaS™) product that people love and you share one of these theses, we would love to talk to you. And we are very much open to learning original thesis from you, Founders. You are far better than us to imagine the future.
In the second part of this post (available here), I will dive into the Accountable case and explain why we believe this company is a great opportunity and a fantastic fit to our thesis.

Top highlight
Only few things are as critical as the right pricing strategy for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) ventures. There are several good analyses on SaaS pricing models and strategies in the space of SME customers like https://blog.chartmogul.com/saas-pricing-pages-2017/ or lists of interesting SaaS pricing articles like https://labs.openviewpartners.com/saas-pricing-resource-guide/#.WzzYeKczaUk. One reason for that is that public pricing data is available on every website and studies can be conducted easily. When it comes to (individual and non-public) enterprise SaaS pricing, little recommendations or insights are given. I have seen many start-ups in my life that left lots of money on the table as they started with a wrong pricing strategy and/or did not verify and adjust it on a frequent basis.
In order to understand the focus of this article, it makes sense to have a look at the following chart.
When I talk about enterprise SaaS pricing, I look at firms whose software is creating high value for their customers. However, this comes (almost always) along with a complex sales process. This is shown in the upper right quadrant of the graphics above. A complex sales process goes hand in hand with high customer acquisition costs and longer sales cycles. With a portfolio of almost only enterprise SaaS ventures, we at Senovo learnt a lot during the last years about right and wrong pricing strategies. As I am often asked by founders how to elaborate, adjust or apply the best pricing, I have decided to write some words about pricing strategies in the space of B2B Enterprise software for entrepreneurs who think about or have already founded a B2B enterprise SaaS venture. One remark in advance: my experience comes from lots of board meetings, due diligences of potential investments, own operational experience and discussions with founders and experts in this field. Nevertheless, enterprise pricing (similar to sales and marketing strategies) has to be adapted individually to market, target customer group and region. Therefore, this post can only give some insights about what used to work well in the past with certain software solutions and what you might try with your start-up.
Many start-ups in the enterprise software space struggle finding the best pricing model. Founders often look at competitive pricings or just add a contribution margin (e.g. 20%) to their customer acquisition and marginal overhead costs. Doing so, often leaves lots of money on the table. The goal of every pricing strategy is to achieve a high price with long contract periods within a certain sales cycle.
In order to stress the importance of a pricing strategy, it is necessary to understand where pricing is relevant within the entire value chain. I have illustrated below a typical product development and customer acquisition and retention cycle within the enterprise software space. If different steps work better according to your experience at your firm, you should adjust it accordingly.
The marketing department is responsible to generate leads and position the company’s brand and products within the relevant ecosystem. Marketing channels vary depending on the pricing level at which your product is positioned. High prices might be irrelevant for small companies. Expensive events with only few potential customers might be irrelevant for lower priced products. The initial contact is mostly done by a SDR. Depending on the pricing strategy, this entire process can be extended to extensive RFPs and product demos, if the conversion rates and the pricing scheme is right. If not, SDRs must shorten or lengthen the process accordingly. The testing and closing phases are similar to the initial contact phase. The higher the potential price, the more complex PoCs can be and the longer the negotiations might last. When it comes to software roll-out, the necessity of customizations and implementations must be considered within your pricing. This goes hand in hand with the support your customers need or expect from you. Apart from service level agreements, this aspect must also be considered in your pricing strategy. Moreover, the effort you have to put into retention, new product migration and upselling should be part of your thoughts about pricing, too.
Last but not least, why have I added “costs” on the very left side? Costs (not only product i.e. development costs, but also sales and marketing costs resulting into customer acquisition costs) are important to consider in order to assess one’s own business model as well as finding a lower pricing boundary. With a new product just launched, estimating CAC is really hard. Then, experiences with other products might help to set an initial lower limit on your pricing which must be adjusted with more insights gained after a certain period.
There are many stakeholders that have an influence on pricing or should at least be taken into account when thinking about your pricing. So, who should be actually involved in a company’s pricing strategy?
Overall, all stakeholders described above might have a certain influence on the pricing strategy of an enterprise software venture. Nevertheless, my experience shows efficiency and target customers represent the most influential factors. So, what are the key observations and learnings how to approach an enterprise pricing strategy for enterprise software ventures?
Having seen many approaches and discussed different pricing strategies for more than 10 years, here are my main learnings and insights:
Trial and error!
Play with pricings. Founders and managers focus too much on pricing schemes that they knew from previous jobs or that were accepted by the first customers. They rarely “play”, i.e. test and change pricing strategies. This is a must in the first year of launching a new product. After that period, I recommend that at least once a year the management (including sales and marketing) should review and adjust it accordingly.
Incentive schemes should reflect pricing models!
If incentive schemes for marketing and sales teams are not adjusted to the product pricing conditions, motivation and sales rates will decrease. Amendments to bonus regulations are often forgotten after changes in pricing are undertaken.
Losing customers is natural!
It is not a shame to let a potential customer walk away because of pricing. Founders and managers often reduce pricing at the beginning of a product life cycle in order to acquire the long tail of customers as well. However, pricing reflects quality. In the enterprise space, it is important to show this to customers. This is also an important message to sales managers.
Cash flow is important for start-ups!
Try to find a pricing model which incentivizes upfront payments. As a SaaS company, it is in particular important to focus on it. Otherwise, you will have to raise more money in order to finance sales and marketing in advance before receiving positive cash flow from customers.
Cash flow might be also important to customers!
If you can afford it, be flexible on the payment terms when it comes to existing customers. Extending an existing contract or upselling an extra feature typically comes at much lower CAC than closing a new customer. This should not be a standard procedure, but it might be necessary for certain cases.
Never do proof of concepts or pilots for free!
Some large corporations love testing software for free. Their employees often have little to do. If there is a designated budget available within an organization, a licensing of a software solution is probable. If not, do not waste too much time on demos and free PoCs. You should be able to convince a customer beforehand that your product is worth trying it with some money coming back to you.
Price carefully — and always expect a discount!
Rather go into pricing negotiations with a little too high pricing, than the other way around. Even with tenders, the final decision is only made after a decent amount of price negotiation efforts. Moreover, an enterprise sales process with high annual contract values at a certain stage almost always involves the friendly people of the procurement department. Expect that you have to give at least 10–20% (in some industries even much higher) discounts on your quote as an incentive to the procurement guys of your customer.
Don’t disclose your entire enterprise pricing on your website!
This learning is not related to competition. If your competitors want to find out your pricing, they will eventually do so. This is rather related to your customers. Budgets are different depending on the size of the company, the functional department and industry. Moreover, some costumers will negotiate better than others. Therefore, keep them away from public price lists. You will be in contact with your customers anyway — as you operate in the enterprise space. However, there is one reason why communicating the price for your product/software with the least features available (=the lower boundary) can make sense: if you position yourself in the high-quality high-price segment and show your lowest price tag, you prevent customers with much less budget available from distracting your sales managers.
Clusters within pricing schemes!
Develop pricing schemes for internal use and training of sales people. Cluster prices according to your learnings from previous sales and customer segments. This might include clustering according to type (corporates, academic, government), region, and size (in this case rather enterprises than SMEs), functional departments (e.g. collaboration software used from marketing via sales until customer success), upselling potential and industry among other things.
Stage your pricing according to the customer’s needs!
This is one of the trickiest, but also most relevant, learning. The better you know the need and ROI of the customer benefiting from your software, the better you can stage your product pricing. This task can only be achieved by gaining insights of existing customers. This task is normally accomplished by your customer success team. But be aware, the ROI of your customer can extremely differ between regions (in terms of labor costs) or industries.
Don’t reinvent the wheel!
Try different business models, but never bet only on a new pricing that customers are not used to. I give you an example: if, within your industry, it is commonly accepted that you price a software product per seat on a monthly basis, don’t start to try to sell it on a per usage basis. However, you can (and maybe even should) test new business models with designated customer peer groups in the mid- and long-term.
Keep pricing schemes simple!
Even if you serve different customer groups, start with a simple e.g. 3x3 pricing matrix which is features and consumers (accounts or seats) based. Within the next months, you can extend and adjust it according to learning made. However, keep in mind, the simpler the pricing scheme is, the easier it is to align to sales managers’ incentive schemes.
Lock-in effect is important!
When you think about pricing, consider the ROI for the customer (as described above). However, also keep in mind how you can generate a high lock in effect within your customer’s organization. This includes a single user’s activity (which is hardly influenced by pricing but rather the quality of your product), but also how many people within the and among different departments use your product. The latter point can be strongly influenced by your pricing strategy.
If you have any comments on this blog post or made different learnings in the space of B2B enterprise software pricing, just send an email to alex@senovo.vc. I am happy to discuss your thoughts.

The increasing impact of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and their perturbation of the climatic order are necessitating a major overhaul of how humanity emits waste gases. All countries and industries now face tough targets for reducing atmospheric pollution. China is arguably facing the greatest challenge of all, having vowed to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, with carbon emissions peaking no later than 2030. As per the targets laid out in China’s 14th five-year plan, there is very little room for emissions increases from current levels out to 2025.
With the commencement of China’s 9th National Low-carbon Day, the government looked set to back even more radical reductions targets, dedicating a special week to a ‘green push’ and encouraging public participation. VeChain, with its array of mature blockchain technologies, intends to help catalyze the digitalization of carbon data and help facilitate China’s emissions reductions ambitions.
VeChain’s brand new Digital Carbon Footprint SaaS Service is a powerful, rapidly deployable tool, enabling enterprises of all sizes to re-engineer their carbon footprint data management practices. This new offering is also the first of its kind to benefit from the combination of decentralized ledger technology and an SaaS business model.
Brands and their upstream counterparts must abide by ‘green’ protocols and report emissions data as part of their ongoing operations. Unfortunately, not all data can be proven legitimate or be independently verified and so there is a pervasive issue of distrust in carbon emissions data as well as a lack of transparency. Public blockchain provides an elegant solution to this problem and, when combined with IoT technologies and data quality assurance services, neatly addresses the challenge of trustlessly collecting carbon emissions data from the many participants of a supply chain.
Alexandre Gellert Paris, Associate Programme Officer at UNFCCC noted that: “Blockchain can contribute to greater stakeholder involvement, transparency and engagement and help bring trust and further innovative solutions to the fight against climate change, leading to enhanced climate action.”
Supply chains are team efforts by their very nature, just as interconnectedness is a core function of blockchain. VeChain’s Digital Carbon Footprint SaaS Service allows enterprise users to log key data and integrate it with world-leading third party assurance providers within VeChain’s partnership network. This data can then be later transformed into new kinds of value and improve sustainability performance across the entirety of an organization.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives have become a massive global focus since the COVID-19 outbreak began. In the rapidly reshaping Chinese market, rising awareness of these goals are playing an ever-more crucial role in consumers’ purchasing decisions. VeChain’s services provide an opportunity for businesses to amplify transparency and dramatically change the way consumers view carbon labelling. By leveraging VeChain’s intuitive Digital Carbon Footprint SaaS platform, business owners are able to provide end users with full oversight of carbon data and green claims, far beyond the final label.
It is abundantly clear that the world is digitising and decision-making is becoming ever more data driven. The digitalization of carbon is no exception. VeChain’s blockchain-based Digital Carbon Footprint SaaS Service provides a comprehensive and scalable platform for any enterprise to be able to better calculate, track and report their carbon reduction initiatives across the entire value chain.

SaaS(Software as a Service)は、日本でも一般に注目を集めるようになり、ここ数年でSaaS系のスタートアップの数も一気に増えてきた。その中で、私も含め、多くの方が「いかにSaaSを成長させるのか？」については活発に議論している。一方で、そもそも「SaaSがビジネスモデルとして何が優れているのか？」について語られることは少ない。
たまにその理由について、「SaaSは、サブスクリプションで、積み上げ式のストック型ビジネスだからだ。」という意見を聞く。それはある意味正しいが、それはほんの一面でしかないと思う。サブスクリプション型ビジネスは、新聞や携帯電話、金融に至るまで昔から浸透していて、それ自体は新しくない。ではSaaSは何がスゴイのか？本稿では、一歩引いて「なぜSaaSが注目を集め、ビジネスモデルとして、どう優れているのか？」について、私の考えをまとめてみたいと思う。
そもそもSaaSは高成長なのか？をマーケット視点で論じてみたい。
まず、SaaSが浸透しているUSでの、サブスクリプション型企業(SEI)とS&P 500、US小売の売上成長のインデックス比較を見てほしい。
2012-2017年のトレンドを比較すると、サブスクリプション型企業は、大企業全体の指標であるS&P500、およびUS小売を圧倒的に上回る成長をしていることが判る。直近の2017年2–3Qでは、サブスクリプション型企業の売上成長率は年+17.6%と、S&P500企業(+2.2%)の8倍(!)、US小売(+3.6%)の5倍の成長率と言う驚異的な状況だ。
次に、サブスクリプション型の中でのSaaSの位置付けはどうか？
下の図を見て頂きたい。SaaSは年平均+25%成長とB2Bを含む全タイプを超える成長をしており、SaaSがこの高成長を牽引していることが判る。つまりこの高成長が、SaaSに注目が集まる理由になっている。
SaaSがこのように高い成長率を実現している裏には、何があるのか？
よく言われる、導入コストが低いだとか、アップグレードの手間がない等の価値的な視点もあるが、本稿では、よりコンセプト的な視点で、私が思うSaaSがビジネスモデルとして優れている、3つのポイントを論じたい。(この点、Zuora社創業者 Tien氏の「Subscribed」から影響を受けてる部分も多いので、 併せて読んで頂くことをお勧めします。本当に名著です。）
「ユーザー起点？」いきなり陳腐な回答だな、と思われる方もいるかもしれない。しかし、SaaSの本質的な価値は、「ユーザーを起点として、ユーザーへの価値を高め続けられること」にあると私は思う。もっと極端な言い方をすると、SaaSモデル自体が、”ユーザー起点を強いる”と言っても過言ではない。ご存知の通り「オンプレ・ソフトはプロダクト提供がゴール。SaaSはその逆。提供してからがスタート」と言われるが、SaaSは”先払い・継続課金モデル”で、プロダクトを提供してからがスタートだ。プロダクトを提供してからもユーザーの声を聞き、観察し、ユーザーに価値を提供し続けることでしか、事業として生き延びられない。この健全なプレッシャーを、SaaS企業は日々受け続けているため、進化を続けられる。これはただの理念ではなく、ビジネスモデルレベルに落とせているのがSaaSはスゴイ。
ここで1つ、SaaS企業にとって「ユーザー起点」が重要な証左として、世界№1のSaaS企業である、Salesforce社が生み出した、「Customer Success(顧客の成功)」という概念がある。これは、従来の「Customer Support(顧客の支援)」ではなく、より能動的にユーザーを”成功”に導くことが、SaaS企業の成長にとって、生命線であることを良く表している。
この「ユーザー起点」を成功させるには何が重要なのか？あえてスタンスを取って言うと、結局「組織運営」に尽きると思う。成長しているSaaS企業の経営者を見ると、「ユーザー起点」が骨身に染みていて、社内の組織運営も同じ目線でやっている方が多いということだ。当たり前だが、社内で利他的なカルチャーが無いのに、社外で利他的な「ユーザー起点」ができるはずがない。
私の知る限り、結果的に成長しているSaaS企業は、社長の組織運営への意識が高く、「お互いを助け合う/ホスピタリティ」カルチャーを意識的に作り、社員のロイヤリティも高いので離職も少ない。社員と話をしても、とても親切で機転の利く方が多い。大体チャーン・レートも低い。一方、停滞するSaaS企業は、社長の突破力で一時的な成長はありつつも、組織運営・カルチャー作りを放置する傾向が強く、社内の雰囲気もピリピリとしていて、社員の離職も多い。そして、大体チャーン・レートも高い。個人的には、社長の組織運営力とチャーン・レートは、けっこう相関が高いと思う。
恐らくこの点は、私のみならず、SaaS系の投資家も投資する際によく見てると思う。例えば、私も尊敬するSaaSの投資家の1人である、前田ヒロさんのブログを読むと良くわかる。前田さんのポストは組織やカルチャー作りのポストが比較的多く、察するにSaaSビジネスの成長にとって、組織作りが重要だと考えられていて、起業家の方向けに書いているのだと思う。（本人には未確認なので、あくまで予想です）
2つ目のSaaSの優れている価値は、「ユーザーとダイレクトに繋がり、ディープなユーザーデータから事業を進化させられる」ことだ。
自動車のような多くの伝統的な産業では、メーカーから消費者までの距離が遠い。間に、卸売、販売代理店など様々な中間業者が存在する。そのため、ユーザー情報をメーカーが獲得するのは、極めて難しい。(結果、ユーザー起点ではなく、プロダクト起点に陥りやすい。)仮に中間業者がいなかったとしても、電子化されていない物質的な製品は、「いつ、だれが、どう使っているか？」を全て把握するのは、ほぼ不可能である。
一方、SaaSは「どの会社の誰が、いつ、どの位の頻度で、どの機能を使っていて、どの機能を使えてないか？」を把握することが可能だ。そのため、そこで得られたデータを起点として、ユーザーをタイムリーに助けたり、プロダクトを改善して、サービス全体の価値を高められ、結果ユーザーのロイヤリティが高まる。
更に、SaaS企業の社内の事業運営もデータまみれである。社内のセールス・プロセス、ファネル毎のCVR、チャネル別CAC等。ユーザーから社内のプロセスまで、こと細かくデータを集められる。この膨大なデータを集められることが、SaaS企業の超重要な”成長のコアエンジン”である。(逆に、データの見える化が後手になっているSaaS企業は、成長がスタックしがち。)この考えを、ピーター・ドラッカーの言葉借りると、以下の通り。
つまり、SaaSは社内外の統合されたデータへのアクセスが良いため、課題発見が早く、経営へのフィードバック・PDCAを早く回しやすい。そのため、SaaS企業はより機動的な経営が可能となる。また、SaaSはLTV/CAC、CAC Payback Periodsやnegative churn等、課題検知のメトリックスもそろっており、課題への対応策のノウハウも広がっている。ここは、月次/4半期毎のP/Lの結果からPDCAを回している、旧来型の企業と比べると圧倒的な機動力と打ち手の精度の高さである。(が故に、SaaSは成長が早い。）
またSaaSは、ユーザーのデータが大量に集まるので、ユーザーの新たなペインを見つけやすい。そのため、新たなアップセル機能やクロスセルできる新規プロダクトの開発で、既存顧客のARPUだけでなく、顧客体験をよりリッチにできることも大きな要因の1つになっている。これはSaaSビジネスの優れた特徴であり、競合優位性でもある。仮に競合企業が全く同じプロダクトの機能を盗んだとしても、ユーザーとの濃い関係や得られたインサイトは簡単には盗めない。それ故に、簡単にはひっくり返せない。これも、ある意味SaaSの安定成長のドライバーにもなっていると考える。
最後のSaaSが優れているポイントは、「事業の将来性が読みやすく、かつ見る指標が非常にシンプルである」点だ。
まず事業の将来性が読みやすい点について言うと、サブスクリプション/ストック型に起因するものだ。例えば、10億円のサブスクリプション売上でチャーン・レートが年1%だとしたら、何もせずとも次の期には9.9億円の売上がほぼ確実に見込める。つまり、将来の売上の予測が立ちやすい。これは資金調達の観点でも非常に優位である。何故ならば、株価は”将来の期待値”に対してつく。そしてSaaSは、それと同じ将来の目線で事業が見えるためだ。故に、SaaSは投資家からすると投資しやすい領域と言える。(逆にチャーン・レートが高いと、将来の見通しの不透明感が高いので、投資を受けにくいとも言える。）
また、SaaSは成長で見るべき指標もシンプルと言うのも、資金調達観点での優位性だ。T2D3、LTV/CAC>3など、SaaSの成長で見る指標は一般に広く知られており、故にSaaS企業と投資家の間で目線も合わせやすい。(例Bessemer VPのBVP Cloud Index(以下)）また、未来を予測する指標がシンプルなので、VCのみならず、リスク許容度が比較的低い投資家からも資金調達がし易いため、SaaS企業は成長に更なる投資ができるという好循環が生まれてると思う。（特にUS）
以上、コンセプトレベルでのSaaSがビジネスモデルとして優れている、3つのポイントを紹介してきた。SaaSは日本でも注目されてはいるものの、まだまだスタートアップの量×質共に、改善していくことがこの産業の大転換を推進する上では重要になってくると考える。私自身、今後も投資家としてSaaSへの投資は続け、このSaaSによる「産業全体の大転換」を推し進めていきたいと思う。

First off, everything in this post works. Yes, even if you haven’t nailed product/market fit yet (but I’ll get into that later) ☺
This is what we’ve used to get Blossom, a lightweight agile project management tool up to a couple of hundred paying companies anda few thousand dollars in recurring revenue.
Trust me, if we managed to do that, you can do it as well.
I’ve also helped some fellow founders to go through exactly the same setup just to check if I’m not dreaming.
Content marketing can be overwhelming. It’s hard to know what to focus on and how to get started.
This post is basically what I would have loved to read instead of going through hundreds of blog posts, mailing lists and dozens of books.
So here it is. Just focus on this post and get going.You can always add more stuff and change things going forward.
Here is a clip from Glengarry Glen Ross to get you in the right mood.
Disclaimer: this post isn’t very polished yet, I apologize.I just wrote it up on my Caltrain ride up to San Francisco earlier today.
Don’t skip this point. This is what most companies forget about.
People buy why you do it, not how you do it or what you do.Customers buy what you stand for. Your identity, your personality.
Today’s marketplace is no longer responsive to the strategies that worked in the past. There are just too many products, too many companies, and too much marketing noise.
— Positioning, The Battle for Your Mind
It all boils down to how well you are positioned in the minds of your (potential) customers and what you do about it.
A lot of companies get this wrong. They are weakly positioned and have no identity. Not because they are stupid. Just because they did not spend the time to think about it.
They think about their product and revenue, sometimes about their customers but not really about their identity and how they are perceived.
Getting this in order is probably the highest leverage thing you can do.It will affect all other areas of your business. Trust me.
Getting to a clear understanding of your identity and positioning is not easy.Even for the best companies this is a process and takes time & dedication but luckily we’re not alone. ☺
We have support from a few very brilliant people. Here we go …
Des Traynor of Intercom has two fantastic ideation questions forexploring your identity …
Related, here are a few branding & positioning questionsfrom Becca Edwards …
… another take on it, the famous Babylon5 questions …
… or FAKEGRIMLOCK’s post aboutMinimum Viable Personality on Fred Wilson’s blog …
All these questions should help you with getting a grip on your identity.
[You can skip this section, this is just an example about Blossom’s positioning]In our case at Blossom we came to the following conclusion …
Mission: Help our customers to create the best software products out there.Values: Simplicity, pragmatism & continuous improvement.Enemy: Scrum, dogmatism, cargo cult & snake oil.
Once we’ve clarified for ourselves what we stand for and why we care it suddenly became way easier for us to create a narrative & content strategy around it.
Here are some example medium posts that match & underline our personality at Blossom & what we want to be known for …
Let’s look at our case at Blossom specifically. Why pick Scrum, dogmatism, cargo cult & snake oil as our enemies?
We believe they are the things that are holding the software industry back from reaching its full potential. We are moving towards …
But Scrum, dogmatism, cargo cult & snake oil are stalling this transition.We could be much further already. ☹
While there are a lot of ways we can make a difference and help people who create software — I believe the biggest difference we can make is get people off of Scrum & help them to embrace & leverage continuous-flow and a “just-in-time” philosophy.
You might pick other values (and optionally enemies). But once you have your identity defined it gets much clearer which content you might want to create to support it.
Content marketing works incredibly well for SaaS companies.
Why? Adopting SaaS products usually is costly. Even if you lower the barrier for your potential customers by providing a free version or a demo you still need to convince them that it is worth their time to give you the benefit of the doubt.
High quality & well targeted content is a great way to bridge that inertia.
Ok so, here is the deal. There are a lot of writing/blog post formats that work well. That said, I personally found the following framework to be simple & effective. You might want to adapt it or play around with other formats later but start with this one …
Start with the Intention.
I usually put “what I want to achieve with the post” into the header of my textfile/google doc before I start to write the post itself. I basically prefix this area with “Intention:”. It guides me through the writing process.
The post’s intention works great as context for feedback.If you share the draft of your post with others instead of giving general feedback they can give you specific feedback on how to improve your post related to what you actually want to achieve with it.
In a nutshell define what you want to get across (ideally a single thought) to whom (who is your audience?). How do you get their attention (title & open graph meta info)? What do you want them to do (call to action)? …
Obviously this framework will not automatically help you to produce high quality content. It just sets the stage. It helps you to package your content effectively. Use it as a check-list to go through so you’re not unnecessarily reducing the potential reach your content could get.
That said, don’t forget that producing high quality content that fits your narrative and content strategy is the important high-level thing to get right.The format just helps you to distribute your content in an effective way.
Oh one last thing I almost forgot. When you have a blog post or Medium post you can leverage Google Authorship to your advantage.
You basically tell Google that you wrote a certain piece of content by connecting it to your Google+ profile. This makes your content stand out in Google search results (and probably other apps that take authorship information into account).
This is how it looks like:
Re-use the hell out of your content, convert it into different formats and don’t be afraid to distribute it to other places. The content from a blog post can also be …
Having your content published on platforms like Medium, Quora, Slideshare et al have the added benefit that you can easily tap into an existing audience which can be way bigger than your current reach.
Also these platforms are incredibly fine-tuned for search engine rankings. And on top of that they know their users really well which enables them to re-surface your content over and over again to the right people (e.g. look at Quora’s email digests and Medium’s “read next” recommendation).
Think about where your intended audience hangs out. Are there specific niche platforms in addition to twitter, facebook et al? All things being equal 100k readers are better than 1k readers.
The landing page is usually the URL that the most people will visit.Try to anticipate the questions your visitors will have.
Here are a few from the top of my head …
Here are some fantastic examples for landing pages of SaaS companies that really thought through the questions that potential customers might have when they arrive at their doorstep.
Sqwiggle — (Team Telecommuting)
Intercom —(Customer Relationship Management)
HelpScout — (Customer Support)
Blossom — (Agile Project Management)
People might not be ready to buy at the time they find you.Especially if you are looking to educate your customers or change their behaviour the leap of faith might be just too much. Even if your landing page sounds convincing. Many of our customers signed up months after they initially found us. That’s ok.
The great thing is even if they aren’t ready to buy you can still offer them something that’s easy to say yes to (a no-brainer).
This is the honey pot.
The honey pot is a deliverable that gets traded for an email address (or telephone number or similar). The goal is to make it super easy for your potential customers to decide that they want your honey pot.
Can I afford to not read/download this?— Your potential customer
Many SaaS businesses use an ebook, but this can really be anything.Access to a video, a white paper, a demo, a webinar, any valuable deliverable will do.
The key is you ask for an email address. This way you have a list of people to reach out to. A list of warm leads.
A list of warm leads is traffic (& potential revenue) at your fingertips.On demand, whenever you need it. These leads are already qualified.They know you, they know what you do, they know what you are got at.They just did not convert yet.
But you can be even smarter about the email addresses you’ve collected using your honey-pot. You can create a drip-campaign.
It’s basically a hand-full of emails that get sent out automatically (take a look at Mailchimp’s autoresponder feature). This is a great chance to regularly get into the mind of your warm leads. Your chance to build trust over time and provide value.
At one or more points during your drip campaign you might want to try to convert your leads into your SaaS offering. You can even add motivation by offering a time-limited discount (remember the teles.
Once you have a drip campaign in place you might want to regularly check open & click-through rates of the emails you have set up and iterate on them over time. Or switch the content of your drip campaign for other content that
Ideally you will want to tie your drip campaign’s performance to revenue (& lifetime value)
Again some examples … ☺
Chances are there is someone using your service who believes in you.Find out why they are happy & what they see in you.You want to attract more of the customers that are like them.
Case studies are a great way to increase your revenue and to improve the quality of feedback that you get from your customers.
But let’s talk a bit about product/market-fit first.
A lot of founders I meet are super worried about product/market-fit and they feel they haven’t nailed it yet. So they don’t want to spend time and resources on marketing & positioning.
Almost every time I hear this I actually believe that their product is quite good & polished and provides value. The only thing that’s lacking and skewing their engagement metrics is the fact that the lead quality at the top of their funnel is abysmal.
Making customers happy is way harder than making happy customers. Dharmesh Shah gave a great talk on this at Business of Software.
So yes, positioning is super super super important!
Quality of Customer Feedback = ƒ(Positioning)
Product/Market-Fit = ƒ(Positioning × Product)
Case studies are a fantastic way to fix your positioning.Case studies are like band aid for your positioning.
You basically describe how your happiest customers are using your product, how they decided that you are a great fit for them & why they are with you.
This helps similar customers to understand that this is a service for them and that they could also be happy with it. You will attract/make more happy customers, get better feedback and fewer support requests. ☺
On top of that case studies lower the barrier to try your product.Other people already trust you. You can’t be that bad, right?
[Disclaimer: in some situations (e.g. if your positioning was really really bad) you might want to reconsider publishing a case study about your happiest customers if they don’t help you to communicate where you want to go with your product or at least be smart about emphasizing the right parts in the case study so it actually helps to attract the customers you are looking for.]
Again some examples … ☺

Google Cloud Platform
Retaining your customers is one of the key levers besides acquisition for the growth of your SaaS business.
Acquiring more & more customers doesn’t help if they all churn away. Usually the critical time where you lose customers in SaaS is in the beginning.
First off, don’t think of customers that signed up as already converted.
They are giving you the benefit of the doubt. Now it’s time to show them that they landed in the right place.
Ask if they are happy, make clear to them that you are available anytime they need you.
Use products like Intercom to get a feeling for how happy they are, and whether they are the customers you are looking for (again, positioning!).
Some examples for lifecycle emails/events …
Think about which emails/messages might make sense for your product.How can you create an a-ha moment as soon as possible?The first few days are crucial.
Once you have a good feeling that your customers are happy with you it is a good time to make them aware that they can also pay you annually. Usually SaaS companies incentivise this by giving a discount of 1 or 2 months.
This front-loads cash. You can use it to do more content marketing or play around with display ads that lead into your honey-pot to accelerate your growth.
Schedule an email to convert your happy existing customers into annual payment. ☺
Word of mouth works. If someone I know & trust tells me to take a look at something I will take a look.
The thing is, most companies don’t even ask their current customers to refer them to people they know. If your product is absolutely amazing word of mouth might happen automatically but nudging people into it is definitely not a bad idea.
Again, some examples ☺…
Dropbox
Sqwiggle
I hope there was something useful for you in here. Also please let me know if you found other hacks that worked for you.(I’m especially interested in learning more about display ads & retargeting).
If you found this post helpful, please spread the word & share it.You can follow me on twitter where I tweet about Product Management ☺

Be the first to respond.
Hi, it’s Takuya. This blog is a place to share my experiences on my solo devs. I’ve recently released the new version of my solo project called Inkdrop — the Markdown note-taking app.
blog.inkdrop.info
Thanks to all your support, a lot of people came read the article and signed up my app. I’m so happy that this launch has been succeeded and my 7-month journey has finally ended with great result. Before going on to the next chapter, I would like to share how I did for this launch. What I did and why to make this happen.
Around 300 people have registered each month before the launch, but it got more than 1,000 people have signed up this month. Wow, I realized that the total number of registrations have already reached 10K just now! Amazing. The announcement blogpost got read by 12.8K people. Here is the stats report of Medium:
Most people came from this post on Product Hunt and this post on Hacker News. Here is the real-time report of the website on Google Analytics:
Now, how did I make this happen?
You could launch your product without the audience, but having it will increase the likelihood of your success. Gabriel Weinberg emphasizes the importance of building an audience in his book:
Traction and product development are of equal importance and should each get about half of your attention. This is what we call the 50 percent rule: spend 50 percent of your time on product and 50 percent on traction.
— Gabriel Weinberg, Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth
I think you want to spend all of your attention on product until its launch but do not do that. When you decided to build something, talk about it with your friends, write blogposts, and keep sharing your thoughts while developing it. When your product is time to be launched, your audience will be happy to help it spread to the world. I kept writing blogposts and made some YouTube videos during the 7-month journey. It’s totally fine that the audience may not use your app. They also have their audience that may use your app.
Be a giver. I’ve written some blogging tips but there is one more thing you can do from the beginning: Contribute to other communities. Why OSS projects can get a lot of praises is because they contribute to the open source community. Basecamp open-sourced their framework called Ruby on Rails. I also have some open source projects on GitHub. Not only the OSS community, there are also many communities and clusters that may fit your target. I posted some articles on HackerNoon and freeCodeCamp as my app’s target is programmers. More you contribute to others, more you attract people. So find your community to reside. For example, if your target is travelers, do contribute to travel communities and accumulate reputations.
The right things often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. — Paul Graham, Do things that don’t scale
Don’t be a taker. I see some people buy followers and automate their accounts to gain tractions. That’s totally a short-term tactic and will not work well because it only satisfies your desire for recognition. Zombie accounts are not your audience and will not actually help your product spread like Pieter Levels said:
(…) The same applies to buying fake virality. It won’t work. It looks good on paper but it’s not actual humans. And people are less and less impressed with seeing big numbers on somebody’s social media account. (..snipped..) Because we’re sick and tired of fake stuff. — Pieter Levels, MAKE: Bootstrapper’s Handbook
Building audience takes long time. There’s no shortcuts. You have to foster it little by little. Months and years. So it would be difficult to accomplish if you are not really interested in the domain you are working on. That’s one of reasons why you have to do what you love.
As I write articles on my solo devs, more personal developers come see me. I’m so happy that my articles are helpful for their solo projects. And that helps me write more articles like this one. Then, it will attract more people and help my app thrive — That is a good cycle. My audience is now like a solo developer community.
You don’t have to build up a large number of followers. As you can see, I usually get only a few hundreds of reads on blogposts:
Seems like my audience is small — but strong. Because they have actually supported my release. Thanks a lot!
If it is not the first time to launch for your product like my case, it would be great to ask existing users for their reviews about your product. It would build a great trust for your product.
I asked my paid users to drop a line via email. Here is an actual email I’ve sent:
As I basically don’t like receiving or sending bulk mails, I didn’t know how to ask customers for a favor. So I learned copywriting in order to compose an effective message. In this mail, I used Robert Collier’s method. He found that starting a letter with “will you do me a favor?” is the most effective. So I just simply started with “I have a quick favor to ask.”, and describe what I’m working on and what I wanted them to do. Everyone is busy and does not have much time to read a boring long text, so I explained it very briefly and frankly.
On top of that, I added a link to the page which lists example testimonial quotes in the mail so that they can get an idea to write theirs more easily. As a result, 14 people have responded. Thanks for writing!
I rebuilt the website for Inkdrop completely. My design was strongly inspired by Sketch’s website as I love their beautiful and attractive design:
The page structure is as following:
As you can see, each section tries to answer visitors’ questions so that they can consider if it fits their need. It would be useful as a checklist for your website.
I built it with Gatsby.js which lets you build a static website using ReactJS. The source code is here:
github.com
HN is an extremely competitive place since anyone can post. People on HN are geeky and radically honest (and painful). Why I successfully got on its leaderboard is probably because I was also geeky and honest. They hate spams, ads, fakes, and marketings. I have got many upvotes for 4 times on it, which posts were:
Basically these are my blog articles except for #3 which was the landing page for announcing the private beta of Inkdrop. The #2 made the biggest traffic to my blogpost, which was not posted by me (Thanks spiffytech). #4 is my video work using deep learning technology I made four years ago. On top of those my experiences, I can see what kind of posts people on HN like would be about new technology, personal story, and authentic thing. Make it less marketing-y and HN people will like it better.
Comments are basically critical but you can reply them just honestly as you thought so that more people would join the discussion. Because they want to know more about you. Be friendly.
After the launch, thankfully I’ve got a lot of inquiries. One of them was from a person who is interested in buying it. He said he loves to grow products. That was surprised me. But I declined the deal as this project is already a part of my life. I see some of paid users are paying for not merely a product but also my journey to live off of the solo devs. I’ve got many things to share through the project, which would be helpful for other solo developers. I’m spending the very exciting time right now. So I can’t sell it. I also would like to see how far Inkdrop can go and would like to show you guys. Let’s evolve it together!

Be the first to respond.
For the sixth year in a row, we’re proud to work with KBCM Technology Group (formerly Pacific Crest Securities) to share results from a survey of over 400 SaaS companies. The survey represents deep benchmarking data and insights on growth and operations of private SaaS companies.
Thank you to the readers of forEntrepreneurs who participated in taking the survey this year! Thank you also to David Spitz (@dspitz) and the team at KBCM Technology Group for their work on the survey.
To download the full 2017 report, click here.
Part 1 of the survey results focuses on growth rates, go-to-market trends, operational aspects, and cost structure.
We have made some important changes this year, including: (1) using annual recurring revenue (ARR) rather than GAAP revenue as a primary gauge of size and growth; and (2) asking respondents to provide precise numbers (vs. ranges) for certain key data.
The median growth rate drops to 25% for companies with over $25M in ARR and just one-in-five companies with over $25M in ARR experienced growth rates over 50%.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
All else equal, the data shows no discernible advantage (as measured by successful growth) for Field-dominated vs. Inside-dominated distribution. Interestingly, though the data is somewhat sparse, Channel-dominant strategies show some real strength.
(Size-growth scatter view of companies >$10MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Companies focused either 1) mainly on the high-end or 2) mainly on the mid- and low-end (Mid-market, SMB & VSB) grew modestly faster than mixed or Enterprise / Mid-market companies. In comparison, last year’s results indicated there was minimal correlation across these groups.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Not surprisingly, the fastest growing companies spent more on Sales & Marketing. These results are in line with previous years’ results.
Analyzed by contract value, Field sales dominates for companies with median deals over $50K. Inside sales strategies are most popular among companies with $1K-$25K median deal sizes. In comparison with previous surveys, this year shows more confidence in Inside sales in the $1K-$25K range.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Among companies selling $6K-$50K average ACV, we compared those favoring Field vs. Inside sales and found: 1) Inside sales driven companies had higher growth and were more capital efficient; 2) Field sales driven companies had lower churn and higher net dollar retention rates.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Respondents (excluding the smallest companies) spent a median of $1.15 to acquire each dollar of new ARR from a new customer. This is similar to last year’s result of $1.13.
(Size-growth scatter view of companies >$10MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
The median cost to acquire $1 of new upsell ARR ($0.57) is 50% of the cost to acquire $1 of ARR from a new customer. The cost to acquire $1 of new expansion ARR ($0.30) is 26%, and the cost for $1 of renewal ARR ($0.15) is 13%. Compared to previous survey results, this year’s group is spending substantially more on CAC for upsell dollars. Last year, upsell CAC was $0.27, or 24% of new customer CAC.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
While it is difficult to assert that there is significant correlation between size of company and CAC ratio, there appears to be a modestly higher tolerance among larger companies to spend more on CAC.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Other than Internet and Channel sales, where CAC appears significantly lower (but data is sparse), there is no significant correlation between go-to-market approach and median CAC, nor is there a meaningful difference between the distribution of responses.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Not surprisingly, the median CAC ratio for companies targeting larger enterprises is higher than that for those targeting VSB, SMB, and Middle Market companies.
Overall, the median company devotes 30% of their S&M expenses to Marketing, with the remainder allocated to Sales. However, Internet sales-driven companies have much greater reliance on Marketing at 75%. This year’s results are largely consistent with previous years’ results.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Respondents reported an implied median CAC payback of ~18 months, though there was a wide distribution of responses. Results are largely consistent with previous years.
The median respondent gets 19% of new ARR sales from upsells and expansions; larger companies rely more heavily (up to 2x more) on upsells and expansions. This is a similar trend to previous years. However, every group seems to have increased focus and success with upsells and expansions — there are ~5% increases at every level.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Professional services play a minor role for most, with the median company booking P.S. revenues on new deals equivalent to 14% of first year subscription contract value. Median P.S. margins are approximately 26%. In comparison with previous surveys, P.S. margins increased from ~22% last year to 26% this year.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
As expected, companies that are mainly focused on enterprise sales have higher levels of professional services. In comparison with previous results, attach rates ticked up for Enterprise (18% in 2016 survey results).
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 Ending ARR)
Median subscription gross margins are 78%, which is virtually unchanged from the 2016, 2015, and 2014 survey results.
The survey results did not point to a significant difference in direct and fully loaded commissions between companies that predominantly use a Field go-to-market strategy vs. Inside sales.
Median Direct sales and fully-loaded commission rates did not vary significantly across contract sizes greater than $1K. Similarly to previous years’ surveys results, there is minimal correlation here.
Commissions on renewals are either non-existent or very low. Upsells this year command a commission rate nearly as high as new customer sales. The most significant change this year was with respect to how companies are commissioning upsells with 71% of companies this year providing full commissions on upsells, vs. 59% in last year’s survey results.
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 GAAP Revenue)
(Excluding companies <$5MM in 2016 GAAP Revenue)
Results are largely in-line with last year’s survey, except for Professional Services gross margin, which was 11% last year for all respondents >$2.5MM, and is 27% this year for all respondents >$5MM.

『逆説のスタートアップ思考』出版記念の社内セミナーで各社様に伺っている中で、「どうやって SaaS 系の情報を得ているのか」と聞かれたので、2017 年現在の私の代表的な情報源を書いておきます。
※なお今回はプロダクトの担当者が参考にするような、市場環境やノウハウ系の情報が中心です。あまり数が多くても仕方ないので掲載は絞っています。
基礎的な情報として、
は読んでおくべきかなと思います。市場環境や継続率の平均的な数字の概要をつかむことで、今の自分たちのプロダクトの状況が良いか悪いかを判断できるようになります。
もし MRR や Churn、SaaS Quick Ratio、ユニットエコノミクスなどの単語が分からなければ、一年ぐらい前に私が書いた「スタートアップのお金と指標入門講座」を参考にして下さい。
結構色々あるのですが、2017年現在の更新頻度等を考えると以下のサイトなどがオススメです。
あと自分の好きな SaaS のブログをウォッチしておくと良いかなと思います。ただブログは著者の更新頻度が時期によって変わります…。
TechCrunch (英語/日本語) の記事の中にもたまにノウハウ系があって、そういうのは大体寄稿なので、参考になった記事を寄稿している人を辿ればいい人に辿り着くことがあります。
また Hacker News を見ておくと良いのではないかなと思います。Tech な記事から経済記事まで色々流れてきます。
Hacker News については、記事タイトルだけを Google 翻訳にかけたものを掲載するページを作って公開しています。
またそれらが自動的に流れてくる Facebook アカウントと Twitter アカウント (@hackernewsj) を作っています。
機械による雑な訳ではありますが、タイトルが英語ではなく日本語なだけで、いわゆる「目grep」が早くなって、興味のある記事が見つけやすくなるのでフォローしてみてください。という宣伝でした。
また 500 Startup Japan さんは、こうした一部の記事を翻訳してくれるときがあります。たとえば『2017年、SaaSスタートアップが資金調達する際に必要なこと』は、上でも挙げた Point Nine Capital による記事の翻訳です。
TechCrunch のノウハウ系の記事から著者をたどる、ということをお勧めしたように、もしかすると 500 Startup さんの記事で翻訳されたりコメントしているような方々をフォローしてみる、というのも良いかもしれません。

The day you secure that first big corporate deal as a SaaS CEO is phenomenal. You might have been running for a year, growing steadily, and this new deal is now taking you into the big league. Remember that feeling in your gut just before you get the handshake, the smile you’re trying to hold back when you get agreement, and the little dance you do in your head as you’re walking out of the building?
In all the excitement it is easy to forget how that company intends to pay you. Many of your larger customers will want to…

France, like most other European countries, has been swept by the power of SaaS.
Already established global SaaS contenders such as Front and Algolia lead the way. However, hundreds of new companies are coming to life in the Silicon Sentier neighborhood in Paris, and across the French land.
French SaaS is predominantly focused on marketing, development and productivity, with Point Nine Capital’s report from 2016 showing that these three categories make up 51% of the 200 companies examined. Companies working on marketing solutions receive the highest median level of funding — $5.4 million. About two-thirds of the companies are horizontal, offering solutions for a wide range of industries rather than focusing on a single field.
With SaaStock on Tour Paris fast approaching and early-bird tickets running out on April 12th, we have gathered a list of the most impressive up-and-coming French SaaS companies. Come meet them en personne on May 3rd.

https://breadcrumb.vc/when-networks-meet-saas-f4307bf3b296?source=search_post---------191,"Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startups are extremely popular with investors for a host of reasons. SaaS startups are extremely scalable because software has zero (or near-zero) marginal costs once developed, i.e. it costs virtually nothing to create another copy. Combining this scalability with subscription-based pricing results in a revenue model with high gross margins and predictable revenue (ignoring AI and data processing heavy models for now). In addition, many B2B SaaS startups are also fairly defensible because they benefit from high switching costs, i.e. those that are a “system of record” become “embedded” in the day-to-day operations of their customers’ businesses which makes it difficult for competitors to displace them.
So, much like network effect-based startups (although not to quite that extent), SaaS models are both scalable and defensible. They become even more attractive when combined with network effects to create greater structural advantages for startups. This does not include businesses like Udemy and ClassPass that simply use subscriptions to monetize marketplaces or content networks. Instead, my focus is on startups that genuinely combine SaaS products with a network or marketplace model. There are two broad ways of doing this:
Let’s take a deeper look at both.
This model is also called “come for the tool, stay for the network” and is a classic strategy to solve the “cold start problem” that plagues most network effects-based startups when they start out. However, its benefits extend far beyond solving that narrow problem.
First, let's address “the cold start problem”. Network effects-based startups become more useful as more users are added to the network, but they have zero value without other participants (on day 0). For example, think of OpenTable, the restaurant reservation marketplace. It is useful for consumers as it allows them to discover restaurants and make reservations. Similarly, OpenTable’s marketplace is useful for restaurants because it brings them more customers. But OpenTable had no restaurants or consumers when it began its startup journey. It needed one side of the marketplace to provide value to the other.
OpenTable solved this problem by first building a SaaS-based reservation system that allowed restaurants to manage their own bookings and accept online reservations on their own website. This was a “single-player” software tool because it was valuable to restaurants by itself and allowed them to acquire the supply side of the marketplace. Once they gained critical mass on the supply side, they could open the marketplace to the demand side (consumers). This obviously solved their cold start problem, but it had other benefits as well.
In a previous post, I used Uber as an example to describe the geographic scaling challenges faced by companies with hyperlocal network effects. OpenTable is a tier-2 marketplace (as we defined in the marketplace matrix) and exhibits the same kind of hyperlocal network effects, i.e. the addition of a restaurant on the marketplace is only useful to users looking to book that specific restaurant or one in that location (or city). So when expanding to a new city, OpenTable would not be able to leverage its restaurant base in the previous city to attract users organically. However, the presence of a single-player SaaS tool allows it to attract supply (restaurants) in the new location, which can then organically attract demand. So unlike other hyperlocal marketplaces, the scalability of SaaS-enabled marketplaces is not limited by the geographic reach of their network effects. As a result, OpenTable went public in 2009 at a valuation-to-funding multiple of ~6X, above the high-end of the 3–5X expected range for a tier-2 marketplace (and was later acquired by Booking Holdings at a much higher valuation).
Treatwell (previously called Wahanda), is another example of using SaaS to enhance network effects. Treatwell is a marketplace that allows consumers to book appointments at hair & beauty salons. This is a tier-3 marketplace as it is both hyperlocal (consumers and salons need to be in the same location) and has largely commoditized supply (there aren’t many attributes to differentiate each salon). Much like OpenTable, Treatwell bootstrapped supply by using a “single-player” appointment scheduling system, before opening up the demand side. And similarly, this solved both the cold start problem and improved geographic scalability.
However, there is another problem we need to take into account here. As we saw in the case of Uber, commoditized supply in tier-3 marketplaces makes them more susceptible to competition and multi-tenanting, i.e. supply and demand-side using more than one marketplace. Treatwell’s SaaS-based appointment scheduling tool solved this problem by locking supply in place. As long as salons were using Treatwell’s system, Treatwell’s marketplace could access their appointment calendars exclusively. And locking down one side of the marketplace helped retain the other side of the marketplace as well, thereby solving any defensibility concerns created by commoditized supply. And again, we can see the results in the capital efficiency of its exit. In 2016, Recruit Holdings acquired a majority stake in Treatwell (then called Wahanda) at a valuation-to-funding multiple of ~6X, significantly higher than the high-end of the 1–3X expected range for a tier-3 marketplace.
The second approach of combining SaaS and network effects is sometimes conflated with “come for the tool, stay for the network”, but is actually very distinct because “single-player” software is not used to bootstrap or strengthen a network. Rather, SaaS is used to tap into a pre-existing (and sometimes offline) network or a secondary developer platform/marketplace is used to extend the use cases of the core SaaS product.
The first variant of this approach is using a SaaS tool to manage and/or interact with a specific network. Carta is a terrific example of this model. Carta’s first product was a cap table software that connected startups to their shareholders. Previously, startups had to manually update cap table spreadsheets every time shares were issued or sold. Carta automated this process, improving cap table visibility for startups, and improving portfolio visibility for startup investors/employees. This is simple enough, but investors and employees can also have holdings in multiple startups and this is where the network effects kick in.
When Carta signs a startup customer, that customer brings over their pool of shareholders (investors and employees). Improved visibility of their holdings is certainly useful for them, but it is even more useful if they can view all of their holdings (across multiple startups) in the same interface. So these shareholders are organically incentivized to bring other startups to Carta who then bring over their remaining pool of shareholders. This process continues over and over, and as the number of startups on Carta increases, it becomes more useful for all shareholders. This is, in fact, a cross-side network effect (and not simple word-of-mouth) because the product becomes more useful to one side of the network as the other side scales.
I introduced the concept of “network bridges” when explaining the geographic reach of social networks like Facebook. These network bridges act as links that connect disparate network clusters and help the network organically spread across geographic boundaries. Similarly, shareholders who have holdings in multiple startups also act as “network bridges”. The only difference is that these are “cross-side” network bridges, i.e. they act as bridges to organically attract the other side of the network (startups), who then bring in their own cluster of shareholders, and so on. As this network of startups and shareholders hits critical mass, it becomes nearly impossible to displace Carta. When investors have many (or all) of their holdings listed on Carta, they act to prevent portfolio companies from moving to other solutions. This brings the stickiness and scalability of network effects to their SaaS product and, as a result, they are likely to have market-leading retention and unit economics as they scale.
If this sounds familiar, it is because Github, Slack, Figma, and Notion exhibit very similar dynamics. The only difference is that it is collaborators working with other teams (internal or external to a company) who help grow the network. These collaborators act as “same-side” network bridges, organically attracting new users to the free plan, as well as converting them to paid plans when the intra-company network expands beyond the free tier. In short, their network effects exhibit the bridging pattern seen on just the right side of the visual above.
So far, the exits of companies following this model have been nothing short of exceptional. Microsoft recently acquired Github at a ~21X valuation-to-funding multiple, while Slack went public at 16X.
The second way of using network effects to enhance SaaS is by building a secondary developer platform or marketplace on top of the core SaaS product. The idea here is that developers can build tools that can be used with the core SaaS product, making it more valuable for customers and increasing switching costs even further. However, this is rarely a viable approach for early-stage companies as it requires scale to attract developers. Examples include Salesforce, Atlassian, and Xero.
Even Github (developer marketplace) and Carta (marketplace for secondary equity transactions) have layered this model on top of their existing products. This goes to show that SaaS for network management and SaaS with secondary platforms are not mutually exclusive, i.e. they can be layered on top of each other to gain even more structural advantages as companies scale.
As we have seen so far, there are many benefits to combining SaaS and network effects. Now that we’ve introduced the concept, we can layer it on top of the basic frameworks I explained in my previous posts. In those posts, I classified network effects-based startups on a 2x2 matrix based on the importance of user identity (or supply differentiation) and the presence of network bridges (or cross-border network effects) to aid geographic scaling. Essentially, I view the presence of an integrated SaaS tool as a third axis on these 2x2s.
The applicability of the models I have described in this post varies depending on the type of network or marketplace in question. “Come for the tool, stay for the network” is applicable to any type of marketplace or network across all the tiers listed on the matrix. However, SaaS for network management (outlined in orange on the matrix above) is only possible in cases where user identity is a core component of that network. The reason for this is simple: Customers will only pay for software to manage a network if the identity of its participants matter, i.e. parents, shareholders, collaborators, prospects, etc. Many of these also exhibit network bridging (tier-1) which makes them immensely scalable. However, there are cases, like ClassDojo, where this can be applied to lower potential, hyperlocal networks as well.
These nuances aside, we have seen that SaaS and network effects can be a powerful combination. I am always on the lookout for startups (across all tiers) with the foresight to leverage both to create unfair advantages in their market.

Como conseguimos chegar lá.
Hoje, 06 de outubro de 2017, completo 4 anos ,6 meses e 26 dias a frente do Trakto.io . Incríveis 1671 dias e noites tirando o Trakto do papel.
Fundei o Trakto com a perspectiva de um designer sobre um problema com propostas comerciais mal feitas. E nesse mais de 4 anos, tirei o chapéu de designer e coloquei o de CEO. A mudança brutal de perspectiva e atividades diárias das minhas funções, foi sem dúvida alguma, o pedal do acelerador e o freio de mão puxado no Trakto.
E para colocar no contexto, deixa eu te mostrar essa timeline:
Eu comecei o Trakto em 2013 como um APP iOS que calculava o valor de um trabalho e montava uma proposta comercial.
Durante 14 meses, passei por duas aceleradoras até definir o modelo de negócio. Em 2013/14 a moda/trending era Mobile First. Apesar de designer, eu cursei administração e sempre gostei muito de matemática financeira. então durante o processo de aceleração foquei em montar uma planilha que parasse de pé. E para isso defini um KPI: R$50.000,00 por mês de receita.
E fiz muitas contas de como um App de produtividade para iOS/Android poderia faturar isso. A conta nunca fechava. Pensa comigo: Se o app custasse R$9,99 eu precisaria vender, todos os meses 5000 apps. Todos os meses. Eu pensei comigo: não dá. muito app gratuito, dificuldade de posicionamento na loja… falei. não dá.
Em junho de 2014 antes de partir para a aceleração na Plug And Play no vale do silício eu decidi ir contra a maré e partir para uma ferramenta na web. As principais razões:
E essas razões me levaram para uma plataforma na Web. Passei 14 meses sem faturar um real com o App iOs e Android do Trakto. mas quando lançamos a pré-venda da plataforma web, consegui meus primeiros 50 clientes a R$40,00.
E foi nesse dia da pré-venda que eu descobri a liberdade de poder ajustar preço, produto e minha “loja” do jeito que queria.
Em dezembro de 2014 lançamos a plataforma Web custando R$9,99 por mês. E tivemos nossos primeiros 1000 usuários.
Ao me transformar num SAAS eu não sabia o que era CAC, nem Churn, nem LTV, nem sabia o quer era marketing de conteúdo, retenção, SEO/SEM… nada. Mas sabia de uma coisa: como montar um modelo de negócio baseado em recorrência. E foi essa certeza por ver uma planilha fechando que me transformou em CEO. Comecei a ver a beleza de uma planilha do mesmo jeito que eu via pixels animados na tela.
Durante os primeiros 18 meses eu não tinha investidor. Investi minha poupança e vendi minha L200 para manter a operação rodando.
Em fereveiro de 2015, com 20 meses de estrada, passado por duas aceleradoras e cerca de 50 clientes no beta decidi que era hora de levantar capital.
Vinha cultivando junto com o João Kepler uma relação de mentoria e amizade desde agosto de 2013 quando nos conhecemos no Demoday Alagoas. Convidei o Kepler para me ajudar a levantar dinheiro e ele topou me ajudar. Me apresentou a um grupo de 6 investidores e levantamos R$350k.
Antes de dar o OK final para o Kepler, eu chamei o Jorge co-founder e o Diego(1st dev.) para um café. Menti dizendo que o negócio não tinha dado certo para testar a reação deles. Queria descobrir quem eram de fato. Se iria sair do barco quando a grana apertasse. Mas eles toparam continuar sem dinheiro e rachar o aluguel. Ali descobri que tinha um time e um co-founder com caráter.
Ao receber o investimento e depois de bater um papo sobre a estrutura que tinhamos tomei a decisão mais arriscada do Trakto até agora: joguei o produto mobile e o beta da plataforma web fora. no lixo. todo meu investimento, meu carro, minha poupança e o resto jogados literalmente numa lixeira digital.
E em Agosto de 2015 colocamos no ar a nova versão do Trakto que além de propostas fazia também outros documentos como apresentações e ebooks. Gerava PDF’s e links para compartilhamento. E por esse produto comecei cobrando R$49,00/mês.
Depois de pivotar veio a dificuldade de comunicar as pessoas que estavamos indo em uma outra direção. E isso dificultou muito nossa comunicação. Não só com o mercado mas também com os investidores, mentores e aceleradoras. Muita gente não entendeu o que era o Trakto nem por que focamos em outros documentos além de propostas.
No primeiro mês(Julho 2015) vendemos 2 assinaturas. DUAS. quase tenho um troço. pensei comigo mesmo: fiz cagada. Pois lia na web casos lendários de milhares de clientes em pouco tempo e achava que com o Trakto seria assim.
No segundo mês(Agosto/2015) vendemos 5. Acumulado agora eram 7. Mantive firme, sem saber ser CEO direito, numa salinha pequena disse: se vendermos 10 compro uma cafeteira pra gente.
Em Setembro/2015 vendemos 27. Acumulado 34 assinaturas.
Essa frase eu escutei do meu pai que me ensinou algumas coisas de comércio.
O dinheiro do Trakto acabaria em Março de 2016. Eu falei com o Kepler para levantar uma nova rodada e ele prontamente me ajudou. João Kepler sempre foi o cara que mais acreditou no Trakto e em mim.
Vai ter uma hora que você não vai ter números bons, nem o produto vai estar bom o suficiente. Seu pitch também não está fechadinho. E é nessas horas que o investidor anjo tem que jogar junto. vai ter gente que vai acreditar nos seus olhos, na sua verdade e na sua vontade. e João Kepler foi esse investidor sempre que precisamos e que precisei.
Conversei com o time. Expliquei que não teríamos grana para investir em marketing e pagar os salários. Então falei: vamos pegar o dinheiro, uns 40k no banco e investir em Facebook Ads. Me de 3 meses antes de fechar um emprego certo em outro lugar.
Ficou eu e jorge no escritório. Durante mais de 15 dias apenas eu e jorge com o telefone na mão, ligando para os clientes e enviando emails sem parar. os dedos literalmente doiam. eu chegava em casa muito tarde da noite. preocupado, estressado… Mas foi incrível o resultado: em 1 mês vendemos 174 assinaturas usando telefone e email. atendendo bem.
Estratégias utilizadas:
Um plano de curto prazo para chegar:
Já para estratégias que testamos mas fomos deixando de lado(erro)
Agora que a brincadeira começa.
Para gerir e tomar estratégias para um SAAS é preciso acompanhar de perto as métricas. Você não consegue avançar sem métricas. Você não consegue levantar dinheiro sem métricas. Você não consegue melhorar o produto sem métricas. Digo por experiência própria, então sugiro esses aqui:
Cancelamento. Para quem vive de SAAS o Churn é tipo um paraquedas amarrado numa corrida de 100m.
É o quanto o cliente deixa de dinheiro na plataforma enquanto cliente.
Some os salários de marketing + investimendo em mídia e divida pelo número de novos clientes no mês.
É a sua receita recorrente. É o quanto você fatura com as assinaturas menos o CHURN.
Pegue toda a receita de novos clientes e divida pelo número de novos clientes. Isso dá uma noção sobre o quanto os clientes estão dispostos a pagar.
Para acompanhar as métricas eu utilizo algumas plataformas:
StripePor quê? É o gateway de pagamento mais completo do mercado. E outra, conectado nativamente a muitas aplicações. Isso facilita de mais a vida.
ChartMogulPor quê? Cara é um dashboard incrível. Fácil de conectar com o Stripe e você tem em tempo real as métricas financeiras.
MetabasePor quê? Conectamos analytics, aquisição, financeiro e dados direto da nossa plataforma dentro de um dashboard único.
Para vender 10.000 assinaturas um SAAS precisa estar maduro em relação as métricas mas principalmente precisa entender bem sua persona, precificação e principalmente construir um produto incrível, competitivo e encantador.
A partir de agora essa é a jornada do Trakto. Vender 10.000 assinaturas. Esse gráfico mostra nossa aquisição de novos clientes ao longo do tempo.Alguns KPIS do Trakto que me fazem crer que estamos no caminho certo:MRR +331.28% em um anoNovos clientes +409.57%
Essa é a curva de aquisição de novos clientes do Trakto feita usando o Metabase:
Para poder vender 10.000 assinaturas, precisamos equilibrar o caixa e principalmente ser agressivos no marketing e no modelo de negócio.
Conversando com o time decidi que era hora de arriscar mais uma vez. Vamos passar de Trial para Freemium. Vamos mexer no modelo de negócio, na precificação e melhorar pontos específicos do produto integrando o Trakto a outras plataformas.
Vender 1000 assinaturas no Brasil e em mais 10 países, me fez compreender muito sobre o mundo de um SAAS. E também me fez entender que para chegar em 10.000 é preciso:
Então vamo q vamo rumo aos 10.000 assinantes. Obrigado João Kepler e Pierre Schurmann pelo voto de confiança e posicionar a Bossa Nova acreditando em empreendedores tanto quanto em planilhas e teses. Jorge Henrique meu co-founder e parceiro vamos simbora!
Te conto como foi assim que chegar lá.

Launching a new SaaS startup in a cutthroat market is challenging. But the end result can be rewarding when properly executed. There is little forgiveness for mistakes and miscalculations. This article will explain when and how you should scale your SaaS startup while avoiding common pitfalls.
Don’t scale too early, when you aren’t ready for it. If you are still operating in any of the following phases, stop now. Go back to work, and acquire your first ten customers before you even think about scaling. Let’s walk through these pre-scaling phases:
If you have already gone through these phases, congratulations! You are now ready to begin the initial SaaS scaling process. Otherwise, do everything manually. This includes customer support, application deployments, and billing. Continue until you validate your market and acquire paying customers. I recommend reading this article to understand the SaaS startup phases.
It’s vital for SaaS startups to think of scaling as a gradual process. I’ve witnessed many startups living in the dream that their software will become viral overnight. They pour time and resources into getting ready for their “big moment.” That moment never happens, and even if by magic or extraordinary circumstances it does, it will not meet your expectations. I’ve learned this the hard way.
The scaling process is gradual. Don’t scale your entire business at once, and don’t scale until you need to. Each scaling stage will cost you time and resources, so it’s best to prioritize your needs and scale accordingly.
At ServiceBot, we usually target three areas when we look to scale a SaaS startup. Billing, customer relations, and cloud infrastructure. Each area targets a different function of your SaaS business. The order in which you decide to scale is based on your current customer feedback and operation pipeline. One might speak to you more than others based on your current needs. Let’s go through these areas.
Most SaaS businesses adopt the subscription billing model. If you are spending time sending manual invoices and reminders to your customers. If you are manually tracking free trials, and aren’t providing tiered SaaS offerings, you may want to start scaling your billing system first.
Scaling your billing processes is dependent on your billing structure. But there are some common improvements any SaaS business can implement to scale their accounting:
Other features consist of giving refunds and credits to the customers. It is also able to apply additional charges to a running software, and giving customers payment approval rights.
If you are ready to start scaling your billing system, write down the functionalities that are necessary for your SaaS business. There are many applications that could help you scale your SaaS billing system, such as Stripe, Chargify, or ServiceBot.
You may have already started off with a customer relation management system to manage all your customers. But CRM goes a lot further than just managing customers. Your relationship with your customer starts the second they land on your website. If you aren’t gathering enough user data, then you are losing customers.
There are some common features to think about once you are ready to scale your customer relationship system:
Scaling your customer relationship system can help you increase your conversion rate. There are many tools on the market that can help you scale your CRM system. Intercom and Inspectlet integration with ServiceBot is a great start to scale your SaaS CRM.
Scaling deployments requires proper architecture and planning. During this phase, you will be adding an auto deployment system. There customers can instantly get access to your software without you doing any manual work.
To automate and scale your deployment system, you should think about the following steps:
To learn more about stabilizing your cloud infrastructure, I recommend this article.
Don’t start scaling until you have gathered all your requirements and understand the full scope of your SaaS scale processes. Give yourself enough time to scale; no software ever works well when development is rushed. Make sure there is proper architecture in place prior to development.
Take advantage of the tools that are out there for you. ServiceBot SaaS management software is a great place to start scaling up your SaaS startup.

The SOURCEEASY vision has always been to digitize the Apparel Industry.
- The SaaS automates workflows and manages business data.
- The Marketplace controls Manufacturing transactions
- The network of Brands builds IP value in distribution.
We’ve just had a shit storm of a time explaining how it works to prospective Investors.
After raising a bunch of Seed money, we felt we had enough traction to go out and raise a Series A, given all the future revenue we were holding.
In June 2016, We narrowly lost an investor for a $10M Series A because we could not articulate our vision appropriately. It was devastating.
We valiantly soldiered on and made the rounds of the Silicon Valley / New York VCs.
But the feedback kept coming in…
In our heads, we could not understand what wasn’t working — The apparel market size was never in question. Neither was the need for automation, scalability and technology in the industry. The team was praised as was our ability to execute.
In hindsight, what was missing was the key narrative:
- How is this business scalable?
- Why is the software not public?
- Why focus on commerce and not SaaS?
- What is the ultimate goal? selling T-Shirts or scaling software?
- Why isn’t there scalable visibility into sales?
- How is this different from E-Commerce?
- Why get stuck in cashflow cycles and receivables?
Great Existential Questions.
In the meanwhile, we were running out of Cash. Rapidly.
We should have just shut down, gone home and licked our wounds.
But the team didn’t give up. Customers kept writing orders. Product kept rolling.
We raised debt (almost every week!), came back to a financial even keel, worked around cashflow issues, micromanaged liquidity, chased collections aggressively, managed terms with Vendors and rolled over $4M in cashflow.
We’ve faced a number of financial, operational, and business challenges in the last few months. Operating without a safety net, on a thin margin of error has not been easy. We’ve had a few near-death experiences, a lot of pressure and pain.
Our Team, Our Board of Directors and Investors, Our Customers and our Vendors have been really patient, supportive and relatively calm through the entire Storm.
2017 is when the Marketplace started working..
At Sourceeasy, We’ve always known that Apparel is a hard market. Building software for the Apparel Industry is a thankless job.
They care about manufacturing their garments — On time, at a great price, and at the right quality standards. They care about relationships they can trust — Around the clock.They care about consistency, clarity, and communication.They care about a seamless workflow that reduces their work.Most Important: They care about saving and making money.
So instead of thrusting software in their faces that faced significant adoption challenges on the vendor side, charging a pithy subscription fee that solved no problems, and throwing buyers over our shoulders to vendors who didnt own the experience, we chose to address the larger problems that the marketplace faced in the Trillion dollar B2B apparel market:

If you are on your journey as an entrepreneur to truly build something new and revolutionary, you will hear a lot of naysayers along the way. Today, Salesforce and Workday both announced their financial results — once again showing that they continue to grow as part of the larger movement to SaaS. Salesforce is now generating almost half a billion dollar a month in revenue and still growing over 30% year over year which is just remarkable. Workday is growing even faster in %-age terms and is the second largest independent SaaS player. But this journey was not easy for the likes of Marc Benioff or Aneel Bhusri.
While the big legacy vendors are now talking and acquiring SaaS, this is what we heard over the last 10 years:
1/ Multitenancy is irrelevant. (And then they tried all kinds of mega and virtual tenancy stuff only to learn that its a hugely important piece.)
2/ They said — Cloud is “just” a deployment choice. Customers want “choice” of on-premise, hybrid and cloud.
3/ They said — you can serve SMB on multi-tenant cloud but never “real” enterprise.
4/ They said — cloud is not secure. Its secure here but not in Europe.
5/ They said — “roach motel” of enterprise software.
6/ They said — yes, revenue but really NO PROFITS at @workday and @salesforce. See the numbers now.
7/ They said — cloud is all about virtualization of data centers. And public cloud is a ‘phase’.
8/ They said — no Startup will ever go IPO on a 3rd party cloud platform.
9/ They said — legacy software companies can “simply” start hosting. (Yes, like Ford can simply start cars-as-a-service and become Uber.)
10/ Finally, to the VCs who said “CRM is dead. I will fund next @Salesforce.” What are your startups doing in MRR? $500M in MRR anyone?
Even as these companies continue to grow, the doubts continue to be raised.
When you are inventing a new future, expect resistance.

In the beginning everyone made their own software. This meant you had the depth of functionality you needed, if you missed anything you just added it. But it is very expensive to make everything yourself.
The next step was buying software from a vendor which meant the development cost could be shared among multiple organizations. This lost some depth of functionality but it was much more affordable. And now you were potentially locked-in to an external vendor. As COTS got more popular the competition between various vendors did increase capabilities and reduce cost.
Salesforce pioneered the delivery of enterprise software as a service. Running software in the cloud reduced installation and operating costs. For the vast majority of customers SaaS also increased the uptime and performance of the application.
We’re now in the next evolution with COSS software replacing SaaS. Open source allows for companies to contribute functionality they want to see, meaning you have the depth of functionality you need. The lower operating costs of SaaS software through the use of cloud are retained though the use of cloud native technologies like Kubernetes. And open source software reduces lock-in because a project can be forked.
COSS enabled you to add what you want yourself like custom software, but benefit from shared investment across companies for all of the common capabilities, quality, and speed of innovation. And you have the SaaS/Cloud benefits of the reduced costs and increased reliability that comes with modern cloud approaches.

Be the first to respond.
Hi, it’s Takuya. I’m building a Markdown note-taking app called Inkdrop, which is enough profitable now. It has more than 1,300 paid users and keeps growing constantly. So, I’ve achieved my goal — to make a profitable product to live off of it. It reached 10k USD sales in total recently. With holding 1,000 customers, I don’t have to worry much about covering my living costs. On top of that, it even gives me some buffers to invest myself and to go on a trip. I’m totally happy.
However, it doesn’t mean that I’ve finished my work completely because the app needs to be kept going. There are always issues to solve and features to improve. The servers should be maintained as well, or customers will quickly quit using it. I published a roadmap to tell users what features I will work on. I can see my customers are looking forward to it — So, I can’t stop.
The problem was to find next goal that would motivate me to pursue further. Because earning money no longer sparks my motivation. I couldn’t find an other appropriate goal that makes me resilient enough to endure the hard work. Then, I ended up deciding to stop setting a financial goal anymore. I found myself that keeping my project going without goals is even better than with a goal. I’d like to talk about why I decided not to set a goal and why it is more sustainable.
I’ve written about how I kept my solo project going more than 3 years. It was about grit — sticking to something, work hard, and not quit. It looks similar though, a topic about setting a goal would be another issue.
After I accomplished the 1,000-customer goal, I found myself not so motivated than before. Because the goal has gone away when I hit it. I lost one of the reasons to stick with my desk to work hard on issues. I wanted to foster my project more, but why? for what?
Getting 2,000 paid customers didn’t sound nice as a next goal. Because the number “1,000” was just a requirement to live off of it in Japan. Yeah, earning more money is great without a doubt — That lets me go anywhere, live where I like, and buy more things. But…that doesn’t motivate me enough, and I found why in a book written by Daniel H. Pink:
When money is used as an external reward for some activity, the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity. Rewards can deliver a short-term boost — just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cracking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off — and, worse, can reduce a person’s longer-term motivation to continue the project.
— Daniel H. Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us”
In my case, money was like a hope rather than a reward. Aiming for 1,000 customers was fine while my bank balance is decreasing every month, causing a fear. When the number of customers stars increasing, I felt that like seeing an exit of a long long tunnel approaching me from far away. Now my bank balance stopped decreasing and it looks like I’ve got out of the tunnel. One day, when I got up in the morning, I realized that the fear has gone away. Then, I see now money as a reward rather than the hope. But money as a reward doesn’t work as before because it became nothing to do directly and critically with my daily life. Besides, I don’t have a dream to become super rich like Bill Gates.
So, money doesn’t motivate me enough anymore.
Critical thinking helps you think things from an objective perspective. I asked myself “do I really need another goal?” Because the project is just what I love to do in the first place, as I wrote in the article about grit. Making it profitable was merely a requirement to continue doing it and not a genuine source of the motivation. I suspect that I’ve been too much focusing on pursuing the financial goal so that I can feel less my fear.
Jason Fried, a CEO of Basecamp, said in his blogpost that he has never had a goal:
I do things, I try things, I build things, I want to make progress, I want to make things better for me, my company, my family, my neighborhood, etc. But I’ve never set a goal. It’s just not how I approach things.
A goal is something that goes away when you hit it. Once you’ve reached it, it’s gone. You could always set another one, but I just don’t function in steps like that.
— “I’ve never had a goal”, Jason Fried
That is a great insight. Similarly, I feel so happy when I could build things, make progress or make things better. As it’s not a VC-backed startup, exponential growth is not mandatory for me. What I want to do is to make my product better instead of just making it bigger. Like many open-source developers work on their projects just for fun:
Bob Wolf surveyed 684 open-source developers, mostly in North America and Europe, about why they participated in these projects. Lakhani and Wolf uncovered a range of motives, but they found “that enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver.”
— Daniel H. Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us”
Let’s consider a money reward as a bonus. It’s enough to have “where to go” in order to motivate yourself. No more fear-driven motivations.
I would like to keep doing what I love as long as I want. That’s my genuine source of the motivation. The business scale doesn’t matter for me.
So, I’m not aiming for the other kinds of “success”. Instead, I really like what Paul Jarvis said about success:
Success is about finding a way to sustain a business as long as it needs to be sustained. Your success can be measured by being profitable quickly as you stay small and build real relationships with your customers — not because you’re an altruistic hippie, but because it pays off over time.
— Paul Jarvis “Company of One: Why Staying Small Is the Next Big Thing for Business”
By focusing not on endless growth or expansion, it makes your business sustainable. Interestingly, about 90 percent of all businesses worldwide that are more than 100 years old are Japanese. They all have fewer than 300 employees, and the ones that still exist never grow quickly or without great reason.
Moreover, staying small lets you open yourself up to investing in enjoying your own life. So, you can enjoy both your life and work well. You can choose to make more money, if that’s what you want, or you can choose to work the same and make the same amount. It’s all up to you. Figuring out “enough” gives you choices — that is, freedom.
Inkdrop is profitable at the moment, but who knows how long it will last? Focusing on making it better, staying small and building real relationships with my customers would make me resilient enough. But in spite of the hard work, it might still fail in the future. That would be the biggest cause of my anxiety but I don’t care as I wrote:
Anxiety about the future and fear of failure are a barometer that you are really living your life. Along with them, you know what you should do today. Let them come in.
―How I Kept My Solo Project Going Over 3 Years
Life is one shot. Anyway, if it’s going to fail, I would do what I love thoroughly. I would like to live my life without regrets. Let me introduce you some quotes from Lao Tzu(老子) on life:
“If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present.”
― Lao Tzu
So, I will focus on here and now. Hope that helps you find your motivation on your business!

Below is the introductory chapter to my upcoming ebook on building Micro-SaaS businesses. To get it for free when it launches go here.
Micro-SaaS is a term that I started using to describe my business, Storemapper, a simple app that helps merchants add a store locator to their website. If you’re reading this book you likely know that SaaS is Software as a Service, the defining feature of which is that customers pay a recurring subscription fee for access to a hosted version of your app. To an IT geek the key difference is that the code is hosted on a server in the cloud, rather than on the user’s computer. But in reality the biggest difference is that customers pay monthly or annually for continued access, as opposed to a one-off purchase, like back when you bought MS Office 2000 in a plastic-wrapped cardboard box. This is a huge shift for reasons we will dig into later.
And “micro” just means small. A SaaS business targeting a niche market, run by one person or a very small team, with small costs, a narrow focus, a small but dedicated user base and no outside funding. Hence, micro-SaaS.
This book is about my experience building and running a micro-SaaS business. I won’t claim to be a world expert — I’ve built exactly one successful micro-SaaS business — nor will I make any guarantees that anything I have done is replicable. But I think a micro-SaaS business is one of the most powerful business models and lifestyles I’ve ever heard about so in this book I’ve tried to distill some of the things I’ve done right and the many things I’ve done horribly wrong into some more generalized principles. I probably didn’t invent a single one of these principles and in many cases they were blatantly stolen from writers and entrepreneurs who’ve been around the block several times. Where possible I’ll link to the people and resources that were tremendously helpful to me.
This is the standard “Who should read this” section. I’ll assume that you, the reader, have at least some vaguely entrepreneurial sensibilities and want to build something. So specifically why SaaS relative to other businesses like consulting, online courses, mobile apps, ebook writing or food trucks.
Warning: below are some buzzwords like lifestyle design and digital nomad that have (rightly) developed some groan-worthy connotations. I’m using them here simply to avoid re-defining the whole lexicon from scratch. Bear with me.
One book that had a huge impact on my thinking is Shop Class as Soul Craft. The author leaves his think tank job for a life as a motorcycle mechanic. The book constructs a very compelling ethical and philosophical argument that, in a world filled knowledge workers obsessed with abstract career ladder-climbing, the life of an artisan practicing a simple craft can be as purposeful and rewarding a life, if not more so. His craft is fixing motorcycles, but the idea is more generalizable and can apply to software. People have problems, the artisan builds a solution that people pay for and everybody is happier than they were before.
If you’ve spent a career as just one small component in a vast Rube Goldberg machine, it can be very rewarding, bordering on glee, to build a product yourself and see people get immediate value out of it. micro-SaaS offers the opportunity to see the fruits of your labors delivered. Your customers arrive, behind schedule, stressed and with too many things on their plate. You artfully and gracefully remove one of those things from their plate, in exchange for a reasonable sum of money. I find the process very fulfilling and regularly get unsolicited emails of delight from customers who found the experience of using my app — and paying me money — so pleasant they decided to write me about it and make my day. Seriously!
You get some of the above benefits from any remote software business but there’s something special about SaaS. Recurring revenue is unequivocally the most powerful revenue model in the world today. Evergreen content, ebooks, dropshipping, affiliate deals, AdSense, ecommerce, all pale in comparison to how magnificent it is to know that the vast majority of the customer who paid you last month, will pay you the same amount again the next month and the month after. Once recurring revenue reaches a comfortable level, that predictability let’s you carefully start spending less and less time on your micro-SaaS while still making the same or more money. I doubt it’s possible to get it down to zero (the mythical “passive income”), but it’s certainly within reach to make as much money as a full-time salary on 15, 10 or even FOUR (wink wink) hours a week. SaaS can be a business that not only yields money, but starts to give you back your time.
I freaking love to travel. I only got my first passport when I was 20 but it’s been one of my top priorities ever since. A huge part of why I invested the time and energy to build a micro-SaaS business was a burning desire to have a business that I could work on while traveling.
Before 2011 I knew literally nothing about coding. I never took a coding class when I was kid and never mucked around with HTML on geocities or angelfire. I dove in head first because I wanted to build a software company and I couldn’t convince anybody to build an app for me for equity in my non-existent company (I tried). Writing code for a living is the most powerful tool in the lifestyle design toolkit because it is completely, 100% location-independent.
I started writing this book from Chiang Mai, Thailand, procrastinated on it through much of Southeast Asia; picked it back up a bit for a bit in Budapest and Cape Town and hope to publish it while I’m in Bali (fingers crossed). I have no plans and can travel wherever I want in the world on a whim. In the past few years I’ve spent at least a month in Barcelona, Cusco, Buenos Aires, Bali, Tonsai Beach in Thailand, New York City, San Francisco, Washington DC, Budapest and counting.
You can certainly do things like freelance consulting, or work for a startup that allows remote work but it isn’t the same. In the past two months I spent nearly two full weeks completely offline hiking Kilimanjaro and going on Safari in Tanzania. My girlfriend and I did a 2 week road trip across South Africa. I’ve tried doing this kind of thing while managing client work, and it’s possible but very stressful. With a micro-SaaS business up and running at scale I’m able to really travel and disconnect and when I come back the business is still basically fine without me.
Venture backed startups get all the glory these days while “lifestyle business” is treated as almost a dirty word. But I don’t know. During the same period where I built Storemapper, I bootstrapped, raised money for, and ultimately closed a venture-scale startup. It was the most stressful thing I have ever done and it did damage to almost every other aspect of my life: relationships, health, sanity. Getting my micro-SaaS business to a point where it pays me a full income has given back and enhanced all of those things: relationships, health, sanity. Freeing up my time to experiment and collaborate on projects, invest time in myself and others, and yeah, write an ebook.
I doubt that will be my last punishing round in the startup ring, but one of the biggest problems by far was that as soon as I quit my job to start my startup, my income evaporated. I was trying to run a startup while drawing down on my meager savings and frantically trying to raise more funding just to cover mine and my cofounder’s cost of living.
Now that I own a micro-SaaS business under my belt, I can work on a new startup without drawing a paycheck indefinitely, as opposed to being forced to grovel to VC funds just for money to pay for my rent and fancy coffee addiction. If you are interesting in starting a big ambitious startup some day, micro-SaaS could be the perfect launchpad.
I’m Tyler Tringas. In a former life I was an Economics major and a consultant for investors in cleantech. In 2011 I quit my job to build a cleantech software startup, SolarList. SolarList took a long time to get traction, then we launched, raised some money, and in early 2014, we shut it down. There’s a whole epic story there in itself, but through the same period of time I taught myself to code, built a consulting and software development practice for ecommerce startups, and built a ton of side projects. One of those, Storemapper, was a nice little micro-SaaS business that did well and now generates over $150,000 in annual recurring revenue. I started blogging very transparently about my experience with Storemapper and it turned out owning a micro-SaaS product was an aspirational goal of a ton of people. So I wrote this ebook. I hope you like it.
Books about making money are a messy business. For every half-decent piece of advice there is a giant mountain of bullshit to wade through. I never in my life had the slightest desire to write about how to make money or do business things. When I decided to write this book I committed to myself that I would only publish it if I managed to write “the least BS book I could possibly write.” This is harder than it seems but here are a few principles that I have tried to stick to.
I genuinely don’t think I’ve done anything truly impressive in my life… yet. I don’t consider myself a guru on micro-SaaS or entrepreneurship in general. I’ve done some things that worked and a lot of stupid things that didn’t work. But I’m learning from my mistakes and devouring as much of the wisdom out there as I can get my hands on. This book is not a prescription, a script or a template — just me trying to contribute to the collective body of bootstrapping know-how out there. Please treat it as such :)

About a year ago, I have had the occasion to run a workshop about “How to Monitor a SaaS business” for a bunch of seed stage SaaS companies in Paris. I shared the slides with the audience at the time but never shared it more broadly. As it’s summer time and things start to slow down, I thought it was a good time to share these… also hoping that it’ll help some SaaS entrepreneurs to implement some new monitoring tactics in order to start fresh after the summer.
If you’d like to be notified of our next posts you can subscribe to our newsletter.
These do not include any breakthrough ideas but they’re probably a good summary of what most of the SaaS experts (in particular Christoph, Michael J Skok or Tom Tunguz) have written over the past years for early-stage SaaS Startups.
The content is split in 4 parts with 3 concepts per part:
The presentation is quite long, don’t hesitate to jump directly into the part that’s most interesting to you!
The slides are hopefully self-explanatory. If they’re not, or if you’d like to chat, please feel to reach out. Enjoy the read!

When you’re building a SaaS app, you’re probably thinking about features and, the target market, and making sure it’s not full of bugs.
While UX is vastly important these days — and can mean the difference between a failure and a success — it’s often overlooked.
Remember those on-site legacy software platforms people used? Bloated databases that looked like a prototype of Excel running on Windows 95. You won’t catch cutting-edge businesses doing anything but laugh at them these days. Why? Because they aren’t user friendly.
We got used to using sleek SaaS, even casually at first. We came round to the idea of Gmail and got rid of Outlook. We started using the beautifully optimized Trello, Dropbox and Asana. Over time, if it was any more of a hassle than it needed to be, it was phased out and replaced with UX-driven software because, ultimately, bad UX means the difference between a team taking one day or one week on a task.
It’s not just about a steep learning curve, it’s about things not working the way they were supposed to. I’ve used Microsoft as an example so far because even though they started out well, they have since ignored user testing, responded with weak fixes to big problems, and been outclassed by smaller companies who had to innovate because they didn’t have the luxury of having their tools bundled with the world’s most popular OS.
In this article, I’m going to outline a few key principles that your SaaS app should adhere to as its minimum viable UX optimization.
Here’re some of the things that are obvious friction to a new user before they can get into an app:
New users are in the mindset that they are going to get instant value, and if you’re asking more than you’re giving, you’ll suffer what Andrew Chen calls the ‘Product Death Cycle’:

The graph above depicts the funnel your users go through. Just like 80% of the people who see your headline don’t click through, 80% of people who visit your site don’t sign up. And, by the time they’ve interacted a few times with your product, the number of remaining users has dropped tenfold. Why is this?
Well, there are many books that could be written about this, but one of the most basic principles is that new users aren’t shown the value of your product quickly enough. It’s too much friction and not enough reward.
There are a few things you can try:
An app that does this remarkably well is Slack. You can see a full teardown of its onboarding flow here, but the essence of it is that it makes it a joy to register, complete your profile, log in, and learn.
The design time and thought that goes into reducing friction is astounding, even with things you’d never think of, like how it’s hard to type complex passwords on mobile. Slack beat this problem with Magic Links:
(Source)
This seems like an obvious one, but when I look to some apps, it needs say. I’m going to use Excel as an example because Microsoft is easy to pick on, and, unlike Apple, their software has never been thought to ‘just work’.
I recently cancelled my Office 365 subscription. I only really used it for Excel, but I came to find a huge UX oversight that wasted my time significantly. The problem was that it wouldn’t import CSV (comma separated values) files properly. In order to tell Excel that a CSV file was, indeed, comma separated, you either had to adjust the CSV in a text editor or use a wizard to import it.
(Source)
There was no option to just click to open the file and have it display normally. So, I cancelled the subscription and went back to Google Sheets which is far less powerful. This is a good example of a customer churning because of UX, not features.
If you’ve got a common use case, you need to create shortcuts for it and not make the user jump through hoops to achieve what they expected to achieve in the first place.
It’s not always obvious what users are doing with your app, especially if it’s a tool that could be used for different purposes. This makes having a great support process extremely important, and feature requests should be regularly parsed from tickets into a list the developers can work through on JIRA or Trello.
We’ve all been drawn in by awesome copy on SaaS landing pages and perfect design at one time or another. Most of the time, apps live up to the hype, but when they don’t, users can bounce instantly because they started to picture themselves getting value from the app but the app doesn’t convey the same image.
There’s a design rule called the Principle of Least Astonishment that states:
Basically, it means we expect a chair to look and function like a chair. If it doesn’t, it’s bad design because it astonishes the user.
Everything — from social media interaction, brand design, and screenshots — gives users an idea of what they’re going to see when they actually use your app and it contributes massively towards UX.
As well as making sure your marketing material is in key with your app’s experience, you can reduce astonishment by flattening the learning curve.
No matter what kind of app it is, users are going to have to learn how to use it. You can make this easier by adopting familiar design signals. It’s proven that recognizable icons, menus, and interactions make for an intuitive UI in the exact same way we know what to do with a cup or a sock when we see it.
While UX is important and some aspects are horribly overlooked, the well optimized apps are getting the attention they deserve while clunky software is fading out.
We’re still in a UX gray area — even 16 years after Jesse James Garrett formalized the field in his book, The Elements of User Experience Design. But it does seem like design pays off, and the new innovative SaaS designers have a fighting chance against the enterprise behemoths.
Keep these simple principles in mind, and go ahead and make something that ‘just works’.

SaaS comps have never been stronger: of the 93 SaaS companies we follow, the average public SaaS business is trading at 22.6x revenue while the median is 14.1x. Interestingly, the gap between the average and median is wider than ever (8.5x), meaning more attractive SaaS companies are being rewarded with big premiums. Also of note, 60% of companies are trading at 10x revenue or greater (all time high). The data is below.
Negative EBITDA, positive cash flow. The median SaaS business had trailing twelve month revenue of $505mm, EBITDA of -$2mm, but positive operating cash flow of $61mm thanks to up-front collections on annual contracts. So long as you’re growing (the median annual growth rate is 24%), investors will overlook negative EBITDA especially if the business is cash flow positive after working capital changes.
The trend is still on. The chart in the picture shows median revenue multiples we’ve collected since Q4 2014. During that period, the median SaaS multiple has ranged from 4.6x to 14.1x with an average of 7.7x.
SaaS margins are still terrible. Investors and founders love saying “SaaS margins are great.” They’re not. They’re horrible. The median EBITDA margin for the companies above was 0%. Fixed costs for SaaS are terribly high and worse yet those fixed costs are mostly people, meaning the only way to materially cut costs is layoffs. If you’ve ever fired someone, you know cutting costs by cutting people is not easy and hurts the culture and morale of remaining members.
Premium gets a premium. Premium SaaS businesses trade at premium multiples. In the data set, 56 companies trade at greater than 10x revenue, 45 trade at greater than 15x, and 35 trade at greater than 20x.
Growth is strong. The median of 24% is strong given the size of these companies ($505mm of median revenue).
SaaS businesses are healthy. There is almost no debt on these businesses (except McAfee) as banks don’t like ‘asset-lite’ businesses like software. Additionally, these companies have $424mm of cash on the balance sheet on median, plenty relative to annual burn (recall EBITDA is -$2mm). The number of years of cash on the balance sheet is less important given that these businesses are generally cash flow positive (median of $61mm; only 20 out of the 93 companies have negative cash flow. Note that 46 out of the 93 have negative EBITDA, but again that’s acceptable so long as the growth is present and cash flow overall is positive.
Recent IPO’s are killing it. Some of the latest IPO’s are trading at unreal multiples: Bill.com is at 68x, Cloudflare is at 59x, Datadog is 58x, Crowdstrike is 63x, Zoom Video is at 54x, C3 is at 80x, Unity is at 55x, and Snowflake is at 166x (not a typo). It shows that now is a great time to come to market whether you’re raising money or selling the business. Some recent IPO’s are trading at more reasonable multiples (Datto is at 10x, McAfee is at 4x but highly levered), so the disparity in valuation for premium SaaS versus just good SaaS is very wide.

As an early stage company, you’re working against the clock with few resources due to one undeniable fact — until you break even, you’re burning out money.
Therefore, it’s important to focus them where they might have the highest impact. But setting the right priorities early is difficult, because you are on a discovery phase and you don’t know where the highest impact might be.
In the world of SaaS, there are many ways to set those priorities. Following a top-down approach, at Point Nine we have “identified” at least 8 ways to build a billion dollar business.
A common playbook of our founders can be summarised as follows:
The benefit of that playbook is that it allows the company to show progress in the form of traction.
At the earliest stages of following that journey, we tend to observe two phases:
In this series of articles, I will cover 10 priorities that guide companies who follow the SMB’s go-to-market approach. Note that those are relevant for companies at their very earliest stage and they are not ranked by order of importance, but from a higher-level to a more tactical one:
Before moving into the priorities, since often the goal of a seed round is to finance the company to get into a good series A, it’s important to understand what it takes to get there.
Obviously, a lot of factors affect that, but we have seen at least 3 important ones for SaaS companies:
There are many reasons why this is so important, but among others, high growth can point to product-market fit and helps understand how well the sales & marketing engine works.
If the company is growing fast, the new investors might think that the company will keep (or even accelerate!) that growth after the fundraise — something which, unfortunately, does not always happen ;-)
What’s the threshold? Table stakes in SaaS change every day, but more recently we see that companies at +100k MRR and growing 15% monthly in the last 6 months get investors excited.
Great logos as customers give confidence to investors. We believe that those companies are diligent when they buy products, so it helps us believe that your product is superior to its competitors.
Another important factor can be the diversity of your customer base in terms of industries, company sizes, geographies, etc. A more diverse customer base can be understood as a potentially larger market size and more resilience against changes in industries.
Every SaaS investor knows that the unit economics will change over time, but it’s pretty hard to move any key metric — like ARPA, churn, CAC — by a factor of x10 in the short-term because they tend to reflect market and consumer behaviours.
Therefore, current unit economics are another good proxy on how the business will grow in the future after pumping more cash into it.
Obviously, apart from those 3 areas, the quality of the team and product, as well as the size of the opportunity, are key. But good performance in the previous areas speaks about the excellence of the team and the quality of their product. The market size question requires desktop research from the investors.
And now, let’s start with the first priority:
It might sound obvious, but the first step is to spend time and effort understanding your customers’ needs, building something that they love and setting some of the fundamentals for growth.
As a result of that, we believe that it’s important to:
As soon as you identify a relevant pain point, get a handful of great customers as early adopters who provide as much feedback as possible. That will help you to iterate and grow healthier (and probably faster).
Experiment and iterate to see what clicks with potential customers and to get the unit economics right.
Investing early into setting up the tools required to understand your customers’ behaviour and your unit economics will allow you to see how you progress and what’s working or not.
please, don’t run out of cash before you’re in good shape to raise your series A!
All those areas are going to be affected by how do you decide to spend your time, the members of your team, your sales/marketing/engineering processes, etc.
In the next posts I will try to cover some of those topics in more detail.
But basically, at this stage, it’s important to keep a (mental?) list of:
In the first category, you should have very (very, very…) few items.

At Point Nine, we have been focused on investing in SaaS companies and have been fortunate to work with several generations of successful businesses in this segment over the years. Since joining the firm 24 months ago, I’ve spent a significant share of my time looking at SaaS companies using machine learning to change industries.
From my vantage point, it appears that we’re now at a turning point when it comes to the use of AI in B2B applications. I published this post to that effect 18 months ago and I thought it was time to dive deeper into the topic with the benefit of hindsight and data. To that end, I’ve attempted to consolidate our thoughts on investing in AI-first SaaS businesses by creating a customary Point Nine napkin! Why? Because this is the format we typically use at Point Nine to consolidate our thoughts (see our SaaS and Marketplace funding napkin here and there) ;)
This post consists of 3 parts:
I believe that positioning AI-first SaaS companies within the broader SaaS landscape provides an interesting perspective but if you’re just interested in understanding our investment criteria for AI-first SaaS startups, just go directly to part 2!
At a high level, we can observe 6 different innovation trends that have shaped the SaaS industry over the past 15 years, as described in the graph below:
I believe that AI-first companies are forming a seventh category that started shaping up some months ago and I will try to explain why in this post. This categorisation is more exemplary than exhaustive as it tries to cover a vast majority of successful SaaS companies, from Salesforce to Typeform via Stripe… These categories are also not mutually exclusive and some companies fit in several ones.
For the sake of simplicity, I will not go into details of each category but at a high level, here’s how we could look at it:
Each of these innovation trends have shaped the broader SaaS landscape. At Point Nine, we try to build new (and unproven) hypotheses as each generation emerges. Why? Because taking new risks is the only way to find great outcomes (check this post for more on that).
Also, if you’re interested in some recent example of our approach to new investment thesis generation, check Rodrigo’s Hardware as a Service investment thesis in 2015 or our updated SaaS investment thesis.
In the next part, I’ll try to explain my hypotheses when looking at AI-first SaaS businesses.
First, let’s start with a definition:
“AI-first SaaS companies use data and machine learning algorithms at their core to build disruptive product experiences.”
If you’re wondering what “at their core” means, this article does a really good job.
While most AI companies at the Series A or B stage start showcasing revenues that are not so different from a typical SaaS startup, they tend to look very different at the seed stage. This is in part because building a ML-powered software today is more complex and takes more time than building a typical SaaS startup. On top of all the challenges that comes with building a SaaS company, AI-first SaaS businesses need to:
The good news it that the expectations of VCs when it comes to AI-first SaaS startups also differ from those for other types of SaaS startups. Hence, if we were to wait to have the same revenue metrics for an AI-first SaaS startup than for a typical SaaS startups, we would probably miss all the seed-stage AI deals.
Now, without further ado, here is a WIP investment thesis for AI-first SaaS businesses at the seed stage. Consider this a .9 version (it has not yet made it until v1.0) and it’ll likely evolve many times as we keep on investing in AI-first businesses. Our SaaS funding napkin also evolved a bunch of times already (see the 2016, 2017, 2018 versions here).
Want a napkin version and compare it with other SaaS startups? Here it is!
Now, beyond laying down new assumptions with the risk of being proven wrong in a few years, why should we still invest in AI-first SaaS startups and take these new risks?
By essence, AI-first SaaS companies generate a ROI for the customers that is a growing function of the amount of data ingested, time and product usage.
This means that, all things being equal (product maturity, sales and marketing efforts), we can expect AI-first SaaS startups to provide a growing ROI to their customers and eventually have a faster growth driven by faster growth of the new MRR and larger expansion numbers.
Primarily for two reasons:
This fast growth will nonetheless be capped once the ROI has reached a certain level.
Additionally, the more users contribute their own data to the product, the less they’re likely to churn because the product has become better and it has been able to adapt to each of their specificities. Each new data labeled by a user is essentially increasing the lock-in of this specific customer and increasing the overall value of the product.
Take Facebook as an example, another reason why Facebook is so defensible beyond the fact that you find 99% of your friends on the platform (for now) is that the feed of any other social media that would start from scratch would look much less interesting because they would not know about your past preferences.
From an an investment return perspective, VCs want to fund companies that have the potential to become category leader and (outrageously) dominate their market. Investors keep on being so interested in marketplace because they have winner-takes-all dynamics for example. We could argue here that AI-first companies have similar dynamics.
The table below explains why:
Historically, SaaS companies have become defensible for a number of reasons but we can’t argue that they brought winner-takes-all dynamics to the markets they’ve been operating in.
Al-first startups have lots of new challenges that the first generations did not have, but I believe that a small number of them will eventually build monopolies.
It’s an exciting period to be in for SaaS investors!
So… if you’re building an AI-first SaaS company (and strongly believe that you’re building a data monopoly) or just want to discuss this initial investment thesis, send me an email louis@pointninecap.com, I’d love to chat!
It took me quite some time to make sure all of this could fit within one post. THANKS Clement Vouillon for the support in designing the napkin (until the last capital letter) and Nathan Benaich for the expertise in both AI and English grammar.
Thanks to Ash Fontana at Zetta in SF. At Point Nine, we don’t believe that SaaS is dead but Zetta is one of the greatest source of inspiration for us to better understand this 7th wave ;)
Thanks also Lola Wajskop for reviewing a draft of this 6 months ago!

“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.”
This quote ascribed to Abraham Lincoln pretty much encapsulates the age-old wisdom that rigorous preparation is the differentiator with a successful endeavor.
While preparedness is not a sure shot formula for success, ask any marquee founder and you’ll be told how preparation helps a start-up avoid lethal mistakes and mitigate risks.
That’s the thinking behind a 10-week program for founders that Accel is launching.
The aim of Founder Stack is simple yet potentially transformative. We are building Founder Stack to exclusively help early-stage founders gain knowledge and clarity to build their start-ups. They can do this with the help of Accel India and its network of over 140 portfolio companies — without diluting any equity.
The first cohort of Founder Stack is themed around Software as a Service (SaaS) start-ups, a sunrise industry in India with boundless promise. Let’s call this Founder Stack for SaaS or FS(SaaS)
First, some context to why we are betting the first cohort on SaaS.
What if founders could spend 10 weeks with SaaS experts, VCs & experienced founders before spending the next 100 Weeks of uphill battle.
FS (SaaS)is designed as a deeply immersive program for SaaS founders to spend most of their time focusing on gaining knowledge and clarity on their market, revenue opportunities, and long term plans without having to worry about infrastructure, resources, and knowledge.
For a period of 10 weeks, founders meet every Thursday at Accel Launchpad building in Bangalore for MasterSessions, Roundtables and 1–1’s. The remaining days of the week are spent on building their startups.
Accountability is key in the program and constant progress is necessary.
These will be high-intensity sessions related to SaaS with truths, facts, accountability, and actual learnings from people who have seen the SaaS growth journey. Warning: there will be no sugar coating.
The program covers various outcomes likeDeveloping a market mapHow to go about building product teamsDesigning your cross border strategyStructuring your marketing engine before PMF.Choosing your GTM StrategySales Pitch Tuningand much more across all 5 layers. Download Program framework
The program also provides infrastructure access to working space at Accel Launchpad (Koramangala), a financial grant of Rs 1.5 Lakhs as an allowance, compliance support, exclusive deals, special cloud support and more to build your SaaS startup.
We have over 30+ experts from the SaaS industry across all our 5 layers. Coaches will do master sessions, roundtables, dinners, 1–1 and more with you.
Check our coaches here
This is our community-driven initiative. We don’t take any equity for you to join and be part of Founder Stack.
SaaS is our forte and we want to help many founders with our decade of expertise. This is our effort to contribute to the founder ecosystem without any strings attached.
The more Founders benefit in the early stages, the more amazing companies are built in India — which eventually contributes to the growth story of the startup ecosystem and the country. This is what we strongly believe in at Accel.
If you are building a SaaS startup and are in pre- product-market fit stage, we would like to hear from you.

總之，對一個詞鑽牛角尖好暈，沒關係，我們直接進內文吧（XD）
最簡單的定義是，SaaS（軟體即服務）是個讓使用者透過網路連接，使用的雲端應用程式。不過，定義總是敖口，讓我用另一個方式跟你簡單分享。
SaaS 的誕生，除了技術的推進（網路速度、普及率…等），另一個底層核心需求就是「企業追求更高的效率」，讓「專業人能做專業事」，讓一些日常繁瑣的事情，盡可能「自動化」，免去人工的時間成本。
本質上，是技術的進程，配合企業需求不斷演變而成的一種結果。
讓我直接用一張圖，直觀地來看看「企業工具的演進過程」：
如店家會用記帳本紀錄庫存與金流狀況；白板或紙本紀錄會議紀錄；用實體問卷來調查使用者回饋。當然，現在還有很多企業依然是這樣做，有其優點，但是非常難去模式化、規模化。
Microsoft 辦公室工具誕生後，企業們開始將文件「數位（E）化」，或者是商家擁有不聯網的 ERP 系統去管理物流、庫存與物料狀況。
一方面，資料不易流失，省下不少手動人工的時間之外，最重要的是，企業提升了「事後分析」的能力。透過 Excel 或者資料庫工具，去分析資料，決定下一步應該怎麼做。
目前我們正處於這時代，網路基礎技術穩定、移動裝置普及，軟體應用嵌入在我們生活的方方面面，所以商家可以開始透過雲端 CRM 系統，直接跟顧客進行互動，顧客也能直接看到動態流量，不再是冷冰冰的關係；企業內也有雲端協作通訊工具、人資系統，或者雲端的問卷服務…等。
這時候，企業擁有了「事中反應」的能力，多虧了「SaaS」即時更新、跨裝置同步的特性，讓數據可以隨著動作反應，進行溝通，數據也不再是數字而已，甚至能有可視化的形式。
SaaS 最一開始是從歐美開始，但現在台灣其實也有很多不錯的 SaaS 公司，提供給企業優質「解決方案」，在各個層面，分享一些出來：
這是在不久的未來一定會實現的，因為有「足夠的數據量」，以及平台軟體間透過「安全」的方式交換數據，讓用戶的輪廓得以建置的更完善，來達到「事前分析」。
舉幾個情境，一個顧客剛到Ａ商家，Ａ系統透過臉部辨識，調出他這週的消費、其他軟體給他的標籤，進而給予該顧客特定的折扣合促銷方案；一個員工離開辦公室，系統除了從地理位置、行事曆資料與他的交通紀錄預判他的狀況，幫他自動回報給公司「外出辦公」或「生病請假」。
在我們了解了企業工具（SaaS）的演進後，你會發現多數的 SaaS 都是以 To B 為主。然而，這部分會造成有哪些產品特徵、用戶運營上，與 To C 的產品有所差異呢？
加入 JANDI 之前的我，是個自媒體，是把自己當作一個「產品」運營，先找到市場定位，提出解決方法，不斷優化迭代（產品思維），還要想策略推到市場上（專案管理），讓有需求的人找上我（行銷思維），產生價值交換（運營思維）。然而，這個思維大多都是 To C 的。
直到我加入 JANDI，我漸漸從用戶行為，Bottom up 來看整個產品運作，發現在 SaaS 場景中必定會遇到的一個「經典問題」，是過往在 To C 場景，或者各模型中不會有的——「評估環節」。
你將來會遇到這些問題，快來找我幫你提高效率、賺更多錢！
相信在互聯網圈，只要是做用戶增長的都會知道的「AARRR 漏斗模型」；做內容的人也應該知道「內容行銷評估維度：5A 用戶行為路徑」，我根據這兩年的經驗，重新製作了兩張圖，分享在這邊：
該寫的資訊都放在上面了，但這個模型有幾個「遺憾」：
我個人挺喜歡這模型的，是內容營銷者必須了解的底層邏輯，但如果公司規模不大，基本上很難做到每個指標與維度，都去紀錄與評估。
以我自己在 JANDI 為例，我們的產品端都在韓國總部，台灣端只能回報用戶調研後的「產品建議」，做不到實質上的產品設計之外，在內容端也因此被侷限，甚至負責內容的人數很少，沒有一個部門，個人的力量有限，無法全面考量到，這是比較可惜的。
這兩年做下來，我認為「內容營銷」與「用戶運營」，是該放在一起討論的。
畢竟對於 To B 的用戶來說，用戶在不同階段，「需要接收的內容」就不一樣，不像是 To C，大多的用戶是可能打到一個痛點，促使買單後就沒後續了，來得快去得也快，反正量大。
但 To B 用戶的量小很多，每個都要好好對待，因此在不同的用戶狀態，必須給予不同的內容來運營，所以我最後總結出了下面這個模型，也是我這一系列「方法論」文章的基底：
比起我們直接陌生開發用戶，不如讓已經有意識到問題的用戶，一找資料就找到「我們提供的內容」。
這階段就一個目的：盡可能讓用戶在你的產品與服務上，留下越長時間、越多資料！
To B 產品都會有的一個特性：「轉移成本」累積的非常快。
以我們 JANDI 為例，如果企業在上面留下了 10000 條訊息，我們就很有把握他們離不開了。一來是公司員工已經習慣這樣的溝通協作方式，要換的話，教育成本很高；二來是他們的檔案與訊息已經在 JANDI 上，轉移成本也很高。
因此，必須提供「標準式」的行業案例與方法，讓企業在這個「體驗」（freemium）階段，有個方向可以參考，並且隨著這個方向，留下越多足跡。（e.g. 製作以行業為類別的的使用手冊、教學文章）
這一環節是 Revenue 的關鍵點，提供客製化服務給潛在的高價值用戶；設定指標，評估是否要放掉一些快離去（Churning）的用戶。
你可能會問，為什麼第二個階段（Act）還不提供客製化服務呢？
答案很簡單，那個階段的量還太大，如果每個都提供客製化服務的話，除非你公司的資源足夠雄厚，可以隨意揮霍，不然應該「設個指標」，提供給那些潛在的高價值用戶，作為「助推」，以及那些快離去的高價值用戶，作為「回勾」。
因此，通常會在這個時候根據客戶需求，提供客製化的教育訓練、諮詢服務，提供產品以外的服務價值，甚至給予社群。
最後，讓用戶成為我們的內容，進行拜訪撰寫行業故事，或者給他們舞台麥克風，讓他們在同行間說說他們的提升效率、賺了錢的感受。
到了這階段，盡可能去服務自家的付費用戶，他們都是 VIP，不只是他們的使用經驗與回饋，更重要的是他們會是我們最有利的「第三方見證」。
累積行業故事、案例，甚至創造機會在線上討論上、線下聚會讓你們的付費用戶說說話，讓同行的潛在用戶意識到：「別人都有想辦法讓自己公司更好，為何我們還沒做？」
畢竟，一場群眾運動的引爆點，往往不在於第一個領導者，而在後來跟上的同儕們。
這是我在 JANDI 2 年經驗分享的系列文第一篇：
下一篇會提到：為什麼 2B 行業應著重於 Inbound Marketing（自來客營銷），避免廣告思維的大量傳播，以及我們 JANDI 做了些什麼？

多くのSaaS企業にとって、「料金」周りは悩みの種。
ただ料金設定を変えるのは難しくても、「料金ページ」自体を変えることで、CVRを上げたり、より高いプランへ誘導したりすることはできる。
今回は、SalesforceやLinkedInなどを筆頭に、SaaS 250社の料金ページを分析した記事をベースに、SaaS企業が知っておくべき「料金ページ」の7つの事実をざっくりと解説する。
SalesforceやHubSpot、Zendeskなど、実際の価格を載せているSaaS企業の料金ページをご覧になったことがある方も多いと思う。しかし驚くべきことに、SaaS 250社の内、80%は具体的な料金を公表していない。(上の画像はDomoの料金ページの例)
これは、なぜだろう？
EcoSignのCEO Jason Lemkin氏によると、「SaaS企業が具体的な料金を公開しない」ことには以下の5つの理由があると考察している。
1)機能の良さではなく、”(低)価格が全て”であるように顧客に映る2)特に大手顧客は、低価格より高機能を重視する3)料金を公表すると、ディスカウントの対応が柔軟にやりにくい4)機能が増えるとディールが複雑になるため、料金プランが複雑になる5)ディールサイズに応じて、顧客へのアプローチ/営業工数を変えたい (月額100万円と3万円では、アプローチは変えるべき)
一方で、料金を公開しているSaaSはなぜ公開してるのか？
この理由には、大きく2つのケースがあると推測する。
1つ目は、CRMやMAなどSaaS企業が多い領域のように、SaaSの普及率が高く、比較的コモディティ化が進んでいる場合、価格が選定基準の比重として重くなるケース。2つ目は、SMBでの売上成長を志向する場合、料金ページからの短期でのクロージングを重視するケース。勝手な推測だが、マネーフォワードやSmartHR等の日本のSaaS企業の多くが、料金を一部ないしは全部公開している理由の1つは、SMB比率の高い日本の市場環境を反映していると思う。
以降、料金ページを公表しているSaaS企業の情報をベースに解説する。
これは良く知られた事実だが、SaaSの料金プランの数は3~4プランが一般的だ。この背景にあるのが、マーケティングでよく言われる「ジャムの法則」だ。「ジャムの法則」とは、人は選択肢が多すぎると”選択疲れ”で、購入率が下がる現象を指す。著書「選択の科学」でも有名なコロンビア大学教授 Sheena Iyengar教授によると、選択肢は7±2が望ましいとされているが、SaaSのプランはジャムと違い、一つずつの選択肢が直感的に理解しにくいので、この3~4プランの選択肢に収斂したと考えられる。
人の目は「左→右」の順で情報を処理する修正がある。従って、右にいくに従って価格が高くなることを脳は自然と捉えるため、81％の料金プランは「低価格→高価格」で作成されている。
しかし、SaaSのプライシングで有名なLincoln Murphy氏によると、それは間違いで「高価格→低価格」の方が優れていると言う。何故ならば、脳が「左→右」に情報を処理する時に、高価格が先に来るとアンカリング効果で高いプランの購入確率が上がるためだ。下図はTableauの料金表だが、上図のBoxの料金表と比較すると、感覚的にわかりやすい。
料金プランの違いを示す際に、「機能」の違いを示すことが良く行われる。しかし、提供する機能の幅が広がってくると、機能の差をぱっと理解することが難しくなる。そのため、主要なSaaS企業の料金表では、「ユーザーのペルソナに合った価値を先に明示して、機能は後付け」で表現しているケースが69％を占める。上のマネーフォワードのMFクラウドの料金表の例を見ても、ユーザーが選びやすいことは一目瞭然だ。
料金ページの最大の目的は、購入なり問合せなり、いわゆるユーザーの行動を促す「Call to Action(CTA)」だ。そのため、Call to Actionへのコンバージョンを上げるために、64％の料金表では、ウェブサイトのカラーと同化しない、「目立つ配色」にしている。
このハイライト効果については、HubSpotの有名な「赤いボタンテスト」(色を緑から赤に変えただけで、CTAのコンバージョンが+21%向上したこと)からも効果は実証済みだ。
これもSaaSの料金表ではよく見かけるが、「フリートライアル」を設定している料金表は、63％と一般的に行われている。上図は高成長SaaSとして名高いShopifyの料金表だが、無料トライアルへの誘導を強調している。ただ比較的価格の安いSaaSに使われるのが一般的で、価格の高いSaaSでは直営業でのデモ説明の様な、より丁寧なアプローチを行われることが多い。
これも良く一般的に行われる手法だが、最も売りたい/儲かるプランをハイライトしている料金表が全体の約半分を占める。これも前述のアンカリング効果を狙った手法で、よりARPUを上げやすくなる。上のHubSpotの料金ページはこの応用ver.として秀逸で、料金ページを開くと、一番売りたいProfessionalの詳細がパッと目に入るよう、巧妙に設計されている。
但し、ハイライトでのアンカリングは、料金プランが4つ以上のケースで多くみられ、3つ以下の場合ではあまり使われない。（特に3つの場合は、いずれにせよ真ん中のプランにアンカリングされやすいので）
今回は、主要SaaS企業の料金ページに関する7つの事実を見てきた。このようなテクニックを学ぶことも重要だが、様々な料金ページを見てて思うことが、「いかに料金ページで差別化するか、目立たせるか」への創意工夫が見て取れる。ぜひ料金ページを考える際には、上記のテクニックを参考にするだけではなく、色々なSaaS企業の料金ページをザッピングしてみるのをオススメします。

One of the hardest things to do in an early stage software company is get alignment on bookings target for the year. Currently MMC has 13 investments in SaaS companies so we have just been through an intense period of bookings budget setting! In this post I will explain how to sense check your bookings budget and produce high level leading indicators to monitor as the year progresses.
For the purpose of this post I am assuming an enterprise SaaS company with a lead time that averages out at 6 months (i.e. smaller deals close in weeks, the larger deals can take longer than a year). The numbers in the charts below are made up by me for the sake of an example!
The booking budget you set for the next 12 months is largely dictated by the current situation in your business. Most of the work achieving that budget is tactics and execution not strategy or long term planning.
There are 4 key questions you need to answer:
This article is focused on trying to answer the first two questions by:
The most important metric is the historical behaviour of the opportunities you originally forecast to close in a quarter (for Q1 this would be deals in your pipeline on the 1st January forecast to close in Q1):
These ratios will move around a lot quarter to quarter but will trend to a surprisingly consistent level over time so it is important to measure them from the start.
Often companies assume that conversion is the only variable that matters in a pipeline but the accuracy of forecasting the time of close is at least as important. If you can systematically increase your Closed Won in Q %, you will significantly improve the efficiency of your business over time.
1 / (Closed won in Q %) gives you the pipeline coverage you need at the start of the quarter to hit your bookings budget for that quarter (ie 28% “Closed won in Q %” means you need $3.6 of pipeline for every $1 you want to close). From that you can start to build your pipeline development targets and analyse your existing pipeline.
With a six month average lead time:
Before you start mapping your existing pipeline you need a good level of confidence in the quality of data, so do a detailed deal review with your sales team. Focus as much on the forecast close date as on the deal values and the level of qualification.
Now map your current pipeline in a bar chart like the below.
From the above chart you can start to get a feel for how much pipe you need to add before the start of each quarter in order to give yourself the required coverage based on your average “Closed Won in Q %”. But you don’t have real clarity on this until you add in the pipe that will likely roll from the quarter you are in (50% in the 1st chart of this post). Using the chart and table below will give you that as an estimate:
For example, in Q2 you set yourself a bookings target of £550k. You are working on an estimated “Closed won in Q %” of 28% which means you need to start Q2 with £1,960k of deals (ie £550k divided by 28% — your “required pipeline coverage” for the quarter).
The current pipeline of deals forecast to close in Q2 is £800k so you are £1,160k short.
You are starting Q1 with £1,500k of deals in your pipeline, of which you estimate 50% (£750k) will roll into Q2. So by the time you get to the start of Q2 you will likely have £1.55m of pipe due to close in that quarter. But you need £1.96m. So your marketing team need to add c.£410k of deals that are closable in Q2 during Q1 in order to give you the necessary coverage at the start of Q2.
Now you your marketing team has a very clear objective for Q1 that is clearly aligned with your sales teams targets for the year.
Final comment: accurately forecasting bookings in fast growth software businesses is borderline impossible, but the harder you try to get there, the better you will be at running your business. Oh, and because it is so hard you need a way of cash flow forecasting that allows for it which I have tried to explain it in this post from last year: Cashflow forecasting for fast growth SaaS Companies
